####################

Processing independent variable: 'Alcoholism' (datatype: logical, specifiesSubSample: FALSE) (study: Cannon2012.r)

Variable specifying subsamples: FAS diagnosis;
Other ('regular') variable: Alcoholism.

Finding SubSampleNames, that is, the names of those subsamples that have a different value on 'FAS diagnosis' as current subsample ('Control mothers, Total'), but the same value on all other variables.

Subsamples are only specified by 'FAS diagnosis'.

That means the relevant subsamples are Control mothers, Total & FAS mothers, Total.
Dependent variable has as labels 'Control | FAS', which is parsed to 'Control' & 'FAS'
Independent variable has no labels (set to NA). Therefore, the values are used to generate these labels: 'Alcoholism:0' & 'Alcoholism:1'

Extracted Cramer's V:Inf

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Smoking during second trimester') or dependent ('FAS diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Case mothers FAS'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Smoking during second trimester') or dependent ('pFAS diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Case mothers FAS'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

Extracted Cramer's V:Inf

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Smoking during second trimester') or dependent ('pFAS diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Case mothers pFAS'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

Extracted Cramer's V:Inf

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Smoking during second trimester') or dependent ('FAS diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Case mothers pFAS'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Smoking before') or dependent ('FAS diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Control mothers'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

Extracted Cramer's V:Inf

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Alcohol consumption: during second trimester') or dependent ('pFAS diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Control mothers'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Drinking during') or dependent ('ARND diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Case mothers ARND'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Drinking during third trimester') or dependent ('FAS diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Case mothers ARND'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Drinking during') or dependent ('FAS diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Case mothers pFAS'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

This is the intersection of the list with subsamples for which values were extracted for the variables that are irrelevant subsample specifiers (these specifiers are 'FAS diagnosis' & 'ARND diagnosis' and the subsamples with values for those variables are 'Control mothers') and the list with subsamples for which values were extracted for the relevant subsample specifier ("pFAS diagnosis"; the subsamples with values for this variable are: 'Control mothers' & 'Case mothers pFAS').
The subsamples that result are: 'Control mothers' (for both, FAS diagnosis=0 & ARND diagnosis=0).
Dependent variable has as labels 'Control | pFAS', which is parsed to 'Control' & 'pFAS'
Independent variable has no labels (set to NA). Therefore, the values are used to generate these labels: 'Drank_3+_third_trim:0' & 'Drank_3+_third_trim:1'

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Drank_3+_third_trim') or dependent ('pFAS diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Control mothers'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

Cramer's V is 'infinite'. This is likely because the crosstable only has one row or one column. This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Drank_5+_first_trim') or dependent ('ARND diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Control mothers'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

This, in turn, is likely because, for example, we are processing an independent ('Drank_5+_third_trim') or dependent ('ARND diagnosis') variable that is a subsample specifier, but we are doing so *within* another subsample (the currentsubsample we're working in is 'Control mothers'). In such cases, there will usually not exist a subsample to compare this subsample to. Aborting.

Processing independent variable: 'Av_drinks_day_third_trim' (datatype: numeric, specifiesSubSample: FALSE) (study: May2017.r)


One of the variables is numeric and the other categorical.


Finding SubSampleNames, that is, the names of those subsamples that have a different value on 'ARND diagnosis' as current subsample ('Control mothers'), but the same value on all other variables.

In addition to 'ARND diagnosis', subsamples are also specified by 'FAS diagnosis' & 'pFAS diagnosis'. That means we must find those subsamples that have the same value on those other specifiers (and only vary on ARND diagnosis).

This is the intersection of the list with subsamples for which values were extracted for the variables that are irrelevant subsample specifiers (these specifiers are 'FAS diagnosis' & 'pFAS diagnosis' and the subsamples with values for those variables are 'Control mothers') and the list with subsamples for which values were extracted for the relevant subsample specifier ("ARND diagnosis"; the subsamples with values for this variable are: 'Control mothers' & 'Case mothers ARND').
The subsamples that result are: 'Control mothers' (for both, FAS diagnosis=0 & pFAS diagnosis=0).


Subsamples are specified by 'ARND diagnosis;, so 'Av_drinks_day_third_trim' is numeric. These are all relevant subsamples:'Control mothers'.


Only one relevant subsample identified. Aborting.
