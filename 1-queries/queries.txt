# Queries for systematic review into maternal alcohol drinking and FASD

We used these interfaces to search these databases:"

- Ebscohost:
    - CINAHL
    - ERIC
    - PsycARTICLES
    - PsycINFO
    - MEDLINE
- Ovid:
    - Embase
- PubMed:
    - PubMed

In the databases that contained articles most pertinent to our subject matter, we searched in both titles and abstracts; in the one database that was further removed from the subject matter, we only searched in the title (Embase).
