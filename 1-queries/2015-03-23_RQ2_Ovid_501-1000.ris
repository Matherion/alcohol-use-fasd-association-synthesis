N2  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium are validated biomarkers of heavy fetal alcohol exposure that may potentially be used clinically for identifying children at risk for alcohol-related disabilities. However, until now, FAEEs have been largely used anonymously in epidemiological studies, and by child protection authorities in need for verification of heavy alcohol use in pregnancy. Here we describe the first case of a neonate identified as part of a research study on a pilot neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure. The neonate's meconium tested high for FAEEs (52 nmol/g; positive cut-off >2 nmol/g), which prompted active follow-up of the infant's development, identifying early neurocognitive problems and allowing initiation of a remedial program. © 2012 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

T1  - Vitamin A, folate, and choline as a possible preventive intervention to fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Ballard M.S.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - It is recognized that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Alcohol can trigger a pattern of neurodegeneration in rat brains similar to other known gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) specific agonists. However this does not seem to explain FAS entirely, as impoverished care-giving environments have been shown to increase the risk of FAS. Individuals living under the poverty level are at risk for micronutrient deficiencies due to insufficient intake. In particular, three nutrients commonly found to be deficient are folate, choline and vitamin A. There is evidence to suggest that ethanol alone may not explain the entire spectrum of anomalies seen in individuals with FAS. It is hypothesized that FAS may be caused more by the nutritional deficiencies that are exacerbated by alcohol than by direct alcoholic neurotoxicity.It is known that ethanol inhibits folate, choline, and vitamin A/retinoic acid metabolism at multiple steps. Additionally, mice exposed to ethanol demonstrated epigenetic changes, or variations in the methylation of DNA to control gene expression. Folate is important in the production of methyl groups, which are subsequently used to create and methylate DNA. Choline (which is metabolized to acetylcholine) is important in neurotransmission and neurodevelopment. It is also involved in an alternative pathway in the production of methyl groups. In fact a study by Thomas et al. in 2009 found that nutritional supplementation with choline in rats exposed to ethanol in utero almost completely mitigated the degenerative effects of ethanol on development and behaviour. Lastly, vitamin A and retinoic acid metabolism is associated with the regulation of one sixth of the entire proteome. Thus supplementation of folate, choline and vitamin A to mothers may mitigate the effects of the alcohol and reduce the severity or prevalence of FAS. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium, or first stool of life, of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta. METHODS: Placentae (n=4) from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario were taken to the on-site perfusion laboratory. After cannulation and establishment of dual circulation, 1 mug/mL EtG was added to the maternal reservoir and samples were taken throughout the 3 h experiment. Measurements of placental viability were oxygen transfer, pH, glucose consumption, hCG production, fetal reservoir volume, and fetal arterial inflow pressure. EtG was analyzed by GC-MS after solid phase extraction. RESULTS: After 3 h, a fetal-to-maternal ratio of 0.29 was reached, however EtG had not reached steady state between the 2 circulations as net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring at the end of the experiment (Figure). Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all perfusions. CONCLUSION: EtG appears to cross the human placenta and, hence, represent both maternal and fetal load of alcohol.

N2  - In the United States, approximately 80 000 women consume ethanol through all 3 trimesters of pregnancy each year. In this article, we review prevalence rates of prenatal alcohol exposure in the United States and discuss the mechanisms of prenatal alcohol exposure and placental-umbilical effects. Cigarette smoking and delayed prenatal care are often associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. In addition, increased risk for postnatal adversity is common, including maternal depression, foster care placement, and developmental delay. In part 2, we review prevalence rates and the diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and the implications for child neurologists. We discuss management strategies and the importance of a long-term management plan and anticipatory management to prevent the development of secondary disabilities in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Child neurologists play a key role in diagnosis and the development of appropriate intervention programs for affected children and their families. © SAGE Publications 2012.

N2  - Background: It has been estimated that approximately 12% of women consume alcohol at some time during their pregnancy, and as many as 5% of children born in the United States are impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The range of physical, behavioral, emotional, and social dysfunctions that are associated with PAE are collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Methods: Using a saccharin-sweetened ethanol solution, we developed a limited access model of PAE. C57BL/6J mice were provided access to a solution of either 10% (w/v) ethanol and 0.066% (w/v) saccharin or 0.066% (w/v) saccharin (control) for 4h/d. After establishing consistent drinking, mice were mated and continued drinking during gestation. Following parturition, solutions were decreased to 0% in a stepwise fashion over a period of 6days. Characterization of the model included measurements of maternal consumption patterns, blood ethanol levels, litter size, pup weight, maternal care, and the effects of PAE on fear-conditioned and spatial learning, and locomotor activity. Results: Mothers had mean daily ethanol intake of 7.17+/-0.17g ethanol/kg body weight per day, with average blood ethanol concentrations of 68.5+/-9.2mg/dl after 2hours of drinking and 88.3+/-11.5mg/dl after 4hours of drinking. Food and water consumption, maternal weight gain, litter size, pup weight, pup retrieval times, and time on nest did not differ between the alcohol-exposed and control animals. Compared with control offspring, mice that were exposed to ethanol prenatally displayed no difference in spontaneous locomotor activity but demonstrated learning deficits in 3 hippocampal-dependent tasks: delay fear conditioning, trace fear conditioning, and the delay nonmatch to place radial-arm maze task. Conclusions: These results indicate that this model appropriately mimics the human condition of PAE and will be a useful tool in studying the learning deficits seen in FASD. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Choline supplementation mitigates trace, but not delay, eyeblink conditioning deficits in rats exposed to alcohol during development

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Children exposed to alcohol prenatally suffer from a range of physical, neuropathological, and behavioral alterations, referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Both the cerebellum and hippocampus are affected by alcohol exposure during development, which may contribute to behavioral and cognitive deficits observed in children with FASD. Despite the known neuropathology associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, many pregnant women continue to drink (heavy drinkers, in particular), creating a need to identify effective treatments for their children who are adversely affected by alcohol. We previously reported that choline supplementation can mitigate alcohol's effects on cognitive development, specifically on tasks which depend on the functional integrity of the hippocampus. The present study examined whether choline supplementation could differentially mitigate alcohol's effects on trace eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC, a hippocampal-dependent task) and delay ECC (a cerebellar-dependent task). Long-Evans rats were exposed to 5.25 g/kg/day alcohol via gastric intubation from postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to late gestation in humans. A sham-intubated control group was included. From PD 10-30, subjects received subcutaneous injections of 100 mg/kg choline chloride or vehicle. Beginning on PD 32-34, subjects were trained on either delay or trace eyeblink conditioning. Performance of subjects exposed to alcohol was significantly impaired on both tasks, as indicated by significant reductions in percentage and amplitude of conditioned eyeblink responses, an effect that was attenuated by choline supplementation on the trace, but not delay conditioning task. Indeed, alcohol-exposed subjects treated with choline performed at control levels on the trace eyeblink conditioning task. There were no significant main or interactive effects of sex. These data indicate that choline supplementation can significantly reduce the severity of trace eyeblink conditioning deficits associated with early alcohol exposure, even when administered after the alcohol insult is complete. These findings have important implications for the treatment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Despite our increasing knowledge of the magnitude and breadth of abnormalities associated with FASD, little is known about the underlying biological mechanisms. We have established a C57BL/6J mouse model of developmental ethanol exposure that shows FASD-related behavioural phenotypes. In particular, we have shown that that ethanol treatment representing binge-like doses during synaptogenesis (third human trimester equivalent) results in spatial learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze. Using this model, we have also identified genome-wide changes in brain gene expression associated with neurodevelopmental alcohol exposure, both immediately following treatment (4 h postinjection) as well as long-term changes (postnatal day 60). Differentially- expressed genes were extracted (1.5-fold, FDR\0.05) and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology annotations for biological function, pathway, or interactions. Results revealed that the acute response to ethanol (4 h) included significant alterations in inflammatory, cell survival, and, interestingly, circadian rhythm-associated gene pathways. Long-term, persistent gene expression changes were more subtle but affected a number of pathways with wider biological roles. This included significant disruption of cadherin gene family cell adhesion molecules and neurotransmitter-associated pathways (glutamatergic, GABAergic, and serotonin systems were all identified). These data suggest that immediate cell survival mechanisms may induce long-term changes in critical cell-communication mechanisms, which may mediate the effects of ethanol exposure during synaptogenesis and its effects into early adulthood. These genes and pathways have relevance to FASD pathogenesis, and the identification of genome-wide changes in neurodevelopmental genetic programming may facilitate our understanding of the permanent behavioural and neurocellular consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce range of abnormalities and developmental defects to the developing fetus, referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is characterized by a particular pattern of facial anomalies, poor growth, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and defects in several organ systems including heart, kidney, vision, and hearing. FAS babies often have atrial and ventricular septal defects, and other structural cardiovascular defects. The mechanisms by which ethanol disrupts heart morphogenesis is not yet elucidated. We are using zebrafish embryos to investigate ethanol-induced cardiac defects and to dissect mechanisms underlying these defects. To determine heart developmental stage(s) most susceptible to ethanol exposure, we treated embryos in ethanol (0.6% and 0.9% v/v) during different critical stages of embryonic heart development. 1) Ethanol exposure during mesodermal cell migration to anterior lateral plate mesoderm region showed subtle abnormalities in chamber shape and size. 2) In contrast, ethanol treatment during cardiac specification until midline fusion of cardiomyocytes significantly delayed fusion of the bilateral population of myocardial cells (either developmental time or somite stage matched embryos) as revealed by cardiac myosin light chain 2 (cmlc2) in situ hydridization and by live imaging of tg(cmlc2: gfp) embryos. Treated embryos exhibited smaller heart chambers and frequent heart looping defects compared to control at 36 hours postfertilization (hpf). 3) Ethanol exposure during stages from heart cone rotation until chamber formation severely affected heart looping, chamber size, and morphology. At 32 hpf, ethanol induced embryos show narrower, more elongated, poorly looped heart tubes, as compared to normally looped and expanded heart chambers in control embryos. We hypothesized that ethanol competes with retinol and impairs RA synthesis, which interferes with cardiogenesis. In an attempt to rescue the ethanol-induced defects, embryos were co-treated with ethanol and 10-9 M retinoic acid (RA). Strikingly, supplementing all-trans-RA restored cardiomyocyte migration, fusion and rescued morphological defects. We are now examining molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced heart development defects. Understanding these mechanisms will significantly help us understand heart defects in FAS and might provide potential therapeutic targets for patients with this regrettably frequent birth defect.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, producing a spectrum of defects including facial abnormalities, sensory (visual and auditory) deficits, impaired fine motor skills and learning deficits including mental retardation. Our laboratory and others have shown that fetal alcohol syndrome can be modeled in zebrafish by ethanol exposure during early development. We hypothesized that embryonic ethanol exposure may alter the gene transcriptional profile that produces the FAS associated defects. To test that idea, we examined the ethanol induced gene expression changes in zebrafish using Affymetrix gene microarray analyses at early and mid-gastrulation (just prior to neurogenesis) stages. Expression of multiple genes involved in neurogenesis and patterning changed significantly after ethanol exposure, e.g., Delta, Hairy- and enhancer of split-related (Her) genes, Hoxb group of genes. Consistently, ethanol treated embryos showed defects in neural plate formation, neural patterning, neural differentiation, and cranial/lateral line ganglia formation, showing defects in a dose-dependent manner. However, the mechanisms by which ethanol affects normal neurogenesis is not yet clear. Ethanol induced changes in the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the transcription factor, neurogenin1 (ngn1), a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor that controls initial neurogenesis steps. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that ngn1 expression in the ethanol treated embryos was reduced at gastrulation stages and was increased during neurogenesis compared to that of the control embryos. We hypothesized that ethanol affects neural patterning by competing with retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, thus impairing retinoic acid synthesis. We observed that not only the phenotypic defects but many of the neural differentiation and patterning defects induced by ethanol exposure were rescued by a co-treatment with retinoic acid in the medium. Future work focuses on dissecting the molecular mechanisms behind ethanol defects and the retinoic acid rescue on neural development. Understanding neural development mechanisms disrupted by ethanol exposure will help identify potential therapeutic targets for neural defects in FAS.

T1  - Decreasing women's alcohol use during pregnancy
A1  - Osterman R.L.
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - A woman's use of alcohol during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), a combination of physical, neurological, and cognitive/behavioral abnormalities that has serious, lifelong ramifications for the child. Still pregnant women continue to consume alcohol with recently reported prevalence estimates of FASD on the increase. Intervention studies have been successful in decreasing prenatal alcohol use in alcohol dependent and nondependent women. Yet translation of these interventions into clinical practice is essential to prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancies. This article provides information to assist practitioners in the provision of evidence-based interventions that decrease prenatal alcohol use, thereby, decreasing future incidence of FASD.

N2  - Background: HIV-positive pregnant women who drink put their children at risk of both HIV and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) has the highest prevalence of HIV in South Africa, but has not before been considered an area of high alcohol consumption among women. This paper analyzes a large sample of HIV+ pregnant women in KZN to examine alcohol consumption in that population. Methods: Data came from assessments of women enrolled in Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission programs at 8 clinics in KZN. Descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were used to examine the prevalence and correlates of alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Results: Of 1201 women assessed, 18% reported drinking during pregnancy, and 67% of drinkers usually binged when drinking (had 3+ drinks in one sitting). Over one-third of drinkers binged twice a month or more. Women living in urban and peri-urban locations were more likely to drink, as were those with indicators of higher economic status and greater social engagement. Married women were less likely to drink, while women who had poorer mental health, used tobacco, or had a greater history of sexual risk-taking were more likely to drink. Conclusion: Health care workers in KZN should be aware that pregnant women who drink are likely to do so at a level that is dangerous for their babies. Some factors associated with drinking indicate social/environmental influences that need to be counteracted by greater dissemination of information about the dangers of drinking, and greater support for abstinence or moderation. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) represent a significant public health problem. The influence of the male partner's alcohol consumption patterns and the quality of the partner's intimate relationship might be important factors to consider in the design of successful FASD prevention programs. Method: As part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, 166 pregnant women in two regions in Ukraine participated in an in-person interview at an average gestational age of 18-19 weeks. Subjects were classified cross-sectionally as abstainers/light drinkers (n = 80), defined as low or no consumption of alcohol in the periconceptional period and none in the most recent 2 weeks of pregnancy; discontinuers (n = 43), defined as moderate to heavy alcohol use in the periconceptional period but none during the most recent 2 weeks of pregnancy; or continuing drinkers (n = 43), defined as continued moderate to heavy alcohol use within the most recent 2 weeks of pregnancy. Women also reported on their partner's drinking behavior and on the quality of their intimate relation- ship. Results: Heavy paternal drinking was significantly associated with both continuing maternal drinking in the most recent 2 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 34.1; 95% CI [5.9, 195.8]) and being a risky drinker only around conception (adjusted OR = 27.0; 95% CI [5.0, 147.7]). In addition, women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy had lower mean scores for satisfaction with partners' relationship and ability to discuss problems (p <.05) compared with light drinkers/abstainers. Conclusions: This study suggests that development of partner-based interventions, as opposed to those solely focused on maternal drinking, might be warranted as a strategy to prevent FASD.

N2  - Objective: South Africa has among the highest reported rates of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) globally. Primary prevention targeting women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies could substantially reduce the incidence of FAS. We evaluated the effectiveness of a short training intervention to improve service providers' screening, identification, and management of women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Method: Training to screen and counsel women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies was offered to 86 service providers (95% of whom were female) in two municipalities in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Effectiveness was evaluated through a before-after study of service providers' knowledge and confidence levels and a comparison of service providers' practices (assessed indirectly via service user exit interviews) at intervention and control clinics. Results: The proportion of service providers indicating that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the fetus increased after training (23% vs. 67%; p< 001). After training, providers expressed significantly more confidence for four skills indicators related to the identification and management of women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Female clients at intervention clinics were more likely than those at the control clinics to receive alcohol advice (odds ratio [OR] = 2.13, 95% CI [1.27, 3.53]), counseling (OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.05, 1.56]), and an offer of family planning (OR= 1.1, 95% CI [1.06, 2.10]) after the training. Time x Group interaction variable analysis in multiple logistic regression modeling confirmed these effects as related to training. Conclusions: A short training course based on brief motivational interviewing principles appears to be effective in building service provider capacity to better prevent and manage women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A native American journey to prevention
A1  - Beckett C.D.
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, the most common preventable cause for mental retardation, is the result of prenatal alcohol exposure. There is no safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy. Native Americans have a higher risk of alcohol abuse than the general US population. The fetal alcohol spectrum disorders prevalence rates for Native Americans range from 1.0 to 8.97 per 1000 births. Nurses and health care providers working in collaboration with tribal fetal alcohol spectrum disorders prevention specialists can greatly, and positively, impact the physical and mental health and well-being of children in Native American communities.

T1  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy: evidence from Canadian Community Health Survey 2007/2008

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy may cause many health problems for the child, one of which is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Since FASD is incurable, actions meant to prevent the occurrence of the disability by targeting drinking women become more important. Epidemiological data on drinking among pregnant women, including prevalence and determinants/risk factors, is essential for designing and evaluating prevention programs. To estimate the prevalence of drinking alcohol during pregnancy and examine the determinants of this behaviour. Using the 2007/8 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) data, we estimated the weighted prevalence of women who drank alcohol during their last pregnancy by provinces. We used a weighted logistic regression to examine associations between drinking patterns, substance abuse behaviours, health-related and socio-demographic characteristics of the women, and the outcome variable. There were two main findings of this study. One was that the 2007/8 prevalence of drinking alcohol during pregnancy in ON, BC, and Canada was estimated at 5.4%, 7.2%, and 5.8%, respectively. The other was that the use of general practitioners (GP) or family physicians (FP) associated with a decreased risk of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. The results suggest that interventions that involve GP or FP and that increase the use of GP or FP by pregnant women can be effective in reducing drinking alcohol during pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Preventing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) depends on obstetricians detecting maternal risk drinking during antenatal care. ACOG and NIAAA recommend using the T-ACE, an economical/ sensitive screen. We have reported that a more stringent T-ACE total score cut-point (3 vs. 2) increased specificity in identifying maternal risk drinking & alcohol-related neurobehavioral dysfunction in children (Chiodo et al, 2010). Our aim was to assess how increasing the T-ACE cut-point could increase efficiency of clinical practice. STUDY DESIGN: Self-reported peri-conceptional & in-pregnancy drinking were assessed with semi-structured interviews and alcohol screens in a prospective sub-sample of 239 African-American mothers given an in-pregnancy T-ACE. The original T-ACE risk criterion (total score of 2) and the revised T-ACER3 criterion with a total score of 3 were analyzed. ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons compared preand in-pregnancy alcohol consumption quantity and frequency measures by risk category. Categories were: 1) No Risk Group (NRG) = no risk for pregnancy alcohol use based on both T-ACE and T-ACER3 criteria (n=140); 2) At Risk Group (ARG) based on both T-ACE and T-ACER3 criteria (n=28); and 3) Change Risk Group (CRG) identified as at-risk with the original T-ACE criterion but not at-risk using the revised T-ACER3 criterion (n=71). RESULTS: The 71 women (30%) in the Change Risk Group (CRG) had patterns of alcohol use similar to the no risk group (NRG). As predicted, post-hoc analysis revealed that the at-risk group (ARG) had significantly more alcohol use both prior to and during pregnancy than either the NRG or CRG groups. CONCLUSION: The results provide further evidence that adjusting the T-ACE total score cut-point to 3 in the T-ACER3 is clinically appropriate. Using the T-ACER3 criteria, only 12% of women would require intervention, compared with 41% for T-ACE. Increasing the total T-ACE score criterion from 2 to 3 results in fewer "false positives," allowing a more intensive targeted clinical response with pregnant women correctly identified by the T-ACER3 as drinking at fetal risk levels.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreases the fetal brain mRNA expression of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD). Our OBJECTIVE was to elucidate the role of oxidant/antioxidant mechanisms in the etiology of FAS by determining whether decrease in SODmRNAexpression is associated with reduced protein expression and/or enzymatic activity. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or vehicle. Fetuses were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18) and their brain processed for protein analysis and enzymatic activity. Western Blots were performed assessing protein expression of SOD normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). SOD activity was measured using an assay based on inhibition of XTT reduction by superoxide. The rate of superoxide dismutation was calculated by the reciprocal rate of formazan formation as measured calorimetrically at an absorbance of 490nm over 30 minutes. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test (significance: p<0.05). RESULTS: Fetal alcohol exposure caused a significant increase in protein expression (0.63 vs 0.27 ratio protein/GAPDH; p=0.02) and no difference in enzymatic activity of SOD (31.9 vs. 32.3 arbitrary units; p>0.10) at E18 when compared to vehicle treated controls. CONCLUSION: The previously reported decrease in fetal brain SOD mRNA expression in FAS is not associated with a decrease in protein expression, nor with altered SOD activity. In fetuses exposed to alcohol, increased SOD protein expression is not accompanied by increased activity of SOD. These findings suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to the preservation of SOD protein expression and activity in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreases antioxidant enzymes in the fetal brain in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Exposure to alcohol is known to decrease expression of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) a serine threonine kinase that regulates glycogen synthesis through phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase. In addition to regulation of glycogen, GSK-3beta is positively correlated with expression of nuclear transcription factors, NF-kappa beta and Nrf2, which are inactive in the cytosol and active within nucleus. Our objective was to evaluate if the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on fetal brain antioxidants can be explained by an effect on GSK-3beta, NF-kappa beta and Nrf2. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or vehicle. Fetuses were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18), and the brain prepared for protein analysis. Western Blots were performed assessing the protein expression of GSK-3beta and cytosolic and nuclear expression ofNF-kappa beta and Nrf2 normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test (significance: p<0.05). RESULTS: GSK-3beta protein levels were significantly lower (0.73 vs 1.06 ratio protein/GAPDH; p=0.01) and cytosolic Nrf2 protein levels were significantly higher (0.72 vs 0.43 ratio protein/GAPDH; p=0.01) in the brain of pups exposed to alcohol compared with control. There was no significant difference in cytosolic expression of NF-kappa beta or nuclear expression of NF-kappa beta and Nrf2 between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In utero exposure to alcohol reduces GSK-3 and increases cytosolic Nrf2 protein levels in the fetal brain. These findings provide a mechanism for the decrease in antioxidants in the brain of FAS offspring, and a potential target for preventive strategies.

N2  - Aims: Prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is remarkably high in several provinces of South Africa; yet population-level knowledge of the harms of maternal drinking remains low. In two heavily affected areas, we assessed effectiveness of interventions to heighten awareness of these harms and to alter social norms about drinking in pregnancy. Methods: FASD prevalence, maternal knowledge and drinking behaviours were investigated in two Northern Cape Province towns, before and after interventions which included highlighting FASD using local media and health promotion talks at health facilities. Independently, two dysmorphologists and a neuropsychometrist examined children at 9 and 18 months. Results: Pre-intervention maternal knowledge of alcohol harms was low and FASD prevalence 8.9% (72/809). Interventions reached high coverage and knowledge levels increased substantially. FASD prevalence was 5.7% post-intervention (43/751; P=0.02); 0.73 lower odds, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity (95% confidence interval=0.58-0.90). No change was detected in more severe FASD forms, but in the whole population, median dysmorphology scores reduced from 4 [inter-quartile range (IQR)=2-7] to 3 (IQR=1-6; P=0.002). Conclusion: This, the first prevention study using FASD outcomes, suggests that universal prevention might reduce FASD by ~30% and have population-level effects. This supports intensifying universal interventions where knowledge of harms of maternal drinking is low. These efforts need to be accompanied by alcohol-dependence treatment to lower more severe FASD forms. © The Author 2011.

N2  - The in vitro derived hepatocytes from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) is a promising tool to acquire improved knowledge of the cellular and molecular events underlying early human liver development under physiological and pathological conditions. Here we report a simple two-step protocol employing conditioned medium (CM) from human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2 to generate functional hepatocyte-like cells from hESC. Immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, quantitative RT-PCR, and biochemical analyses revealed that the endodermal progenitors appeared as pockets in culture, and the cascade of genes associated with the formation of definitive endoderm (HNF-3beta, SOX-17, DLX-5, CXCR4) was consistent and in concurrence with the up-regulation of the markers for hepatic progenitors [alpha-feto protein (AFP), HNF-4alpha, CK-19, albumin, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT)], followed by maturation into functional hepatocytes [tyrosine transferase (TAT), tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygenase (TDO), glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), CYP3A4, CYP7A1]. We witnessed that the gene expression profile during this differentiation process recapitulated in vivo liver development demonstrating a gradual down-regulation of extra embryonic endodermal markers (SOX-7, HNF-1beta, SNAIL-1, LAMININ-1, CDX2), and the generated hepatic cells performed multiple liver functions. Since prenatal alcohol exposure is known to provoke irreversible abnormalities in the fetal cells and developing tissues, we exposed in vitro generated hepatocytes to ethanol (EtOH) and found that EtOH treatment not only impairs the survival and proliferation, but also induces apoptosis and perturbs differentiation of progenitor cells into hepatocytes. This disruption was accompanied by alterations in the expression of genes and proteins involved in hepatogenesis. Our results provide new insights into the wider range of destruction caused by alcohol on the dynamic process of liver organogenesis. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - The goal of this study was to examine social skills deficits among children with and without prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) who were both referred to a respite programme. Thirty-seven children with PAE and 23 non-exposed children (aged 3 to 8 years) were evaluated on the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) by their caregivers and respite workers. As compared with the non-exposed children, those with PAE showed more deficits on caregiver ratings of responsibility, hyperactivity, internalizing problems and overall social skills, as well as respite worker ratings of hyperactivity. The social skills among the PAE group were not related to home placement variables. Among both groups, caregivers rated social skills lower than respite workers, and among the PAE group, girls tended to display more social skills deficits than boys. The SSRS is useful in identifying unique social skills deficits among children with PAE. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Conceptualizations of risks related to women's alcohol use during pregnancy, and the attendant response to preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), are examined in six countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Uganda, Uruguay, and China. Considerable differences were found in how risks were conceptualized across countries and in contextual factors that influence research, prevention, and intervention efforts. Differences in conceptualizations were also apparent within countries. Differences also existed in the degree to which the issue of drinking during pregnancy has been minimized or amplified and in whether and how responses are linked to treatment or other public health interventions.

N2  - An alcohol-server training program to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome was developed, implemented, and evaluated in a comparison study of public drinking establishments in New Mexico and Oregon. The management and serving staffs of 148 establishments licensed for on-premise alcohol sales in the two states studied were trained to discourage alcohol consumption by pregnant customers. Pre- and post-tests of server responses to pregnant-appearing "pseudo-patron" actors ordering alcohol in experimental (n = 148) and comparison (n = 183) establishments were a key method of evaluating the efficacy of this intervention. Within-group chi-square analyses compared rates of service refusal at baseline with 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up points for both the trained (experimental) and the comparison establishments. No differences were found between experimental and comparison establishments at baseline at either site, but significant differences were found for New Mexico at each posttraining measurement point. In Oregon, the refusal rate at baseline increased from 1.5% at baseline to 8.3% at 1 month, which only approached significance. In New Mexico, at baseline the refusal rate was 8.6%, and it rose to 39.2% at 6 months (p < .0001, odds ratio = 6.83) and remained high at 28.2% at 12 months (p < .001, odds ratio = 4.15). No similarly significant gains were recorded at control establishments. Supplemental responsible beverage service training for alcohol servers to aid in the prevention of fetal alcohol exposure can be effective in reducing the serving of alcohol to visibly pregnant women, with robust effects continuing over the subsequent year in the New Mexico establishments.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a syndrome that results from prenatal alcohol exposure and is defined by significant neurobehavioral impairments. Sleep disruption has been recognized as a clinically important symptom of FASD that has multiple negative effects on the child's health, ability to function adaptively, as well as on family and caregivers. However, few studies have addressed and characterized the sleep problems in this population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize sleep in FASD and describe the impact of sensory processing difficulties on sleep patterns in children with FASD. METHODS: Children with FASD were compared with age-matched typically developing children between 3 and 6 years of age. Sleep was assessed using actigraphy, a sleep log, and the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire. The Sensory Profile, completed by caregivers, was used to evaluate the child's sensory processing abilities. Overall differences in sensory processing were correlated with actigraphic parameters measured in alcohol exposed and control groups. RESULTS: Data show that children with FASD have significantly more sleep disturbances than typically developing children, including increased bedtime resistance, shortened sleep duration, increased sleep anxiety, and increased night awakenings and parasomnias. Actigraphy reveals a significant difference between groups for sleep onset latency. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that sensory processing deficits are widespread in children with FASD and that these deficits are associated with multiple sleep problems. Children with FASD should be screened for sleep-related disorders and would benefit from occupational therapy for sensory-based treatment aimed at sleep regulation and consolidation. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - The study investigated how children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure regulate movement speed and accuracy during goal-directed movements. 16 children ages 7 to 17 years with confirmed histories of heavy in utero alcohol exposure, and 21 nonalcohol-exposed control children completed a series of reciprocal tapping movements between two spatial targets. 5 different targets sets were presented, representing a range of task difficulty between 2 and 6 bits of information. Estimates of percent error rate, movement time, slope, and linear fit of the resulting curve confirmed that for goal-directed, reciprocal tapping responses, performance of the group with prenatal alcohol exposure was described by a linear function, as predicted by Fitts' law, by sacrificing movement accuracy. The index of performance was the same for the two groups: it initially increased, then leveled off for more difficult movements.

N2  - When fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was initially described, diagnosis was based upon physical parameters including facial anomalies and growth retardation, with evidence of developmental delay or mental deficiency. Forty years of research has shown that FAS lies towards the extreme end of what are now termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The most profound effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are on the developing brain and the cognitive and behavioral effects that ensue. Alcohol exposure affects brain development via numerous pathways at all stages from neurogenesis to myelination. For example, the same processes that give rise to the facial characteristics of FAS also cause abnormal brain development. Behaviors as diverse as executive functioning to motor control are affected. This special issue of Neuropsychology Review addresses these changes in brain and behavior highlighting the relationship between the two. A diagnostic goal is to recognize FAS as a disorder of brain rather than one of physical characteristics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Several different methodologies have been used to examine the neurophysiological signal changes associated with different brain functions in prenatally exposed individuals and those diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These include electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These studies demonstrate that it is feasible to use these technologies with this clinical population and that the damage to the central nervous system associated with prenatal alcohol exposure has widespread functional implications; however, currently, the literature in these areas is limited and unsystematic. Functional MRI with this clinical population has just begun to explore the implications of prenatal alcohol exposure with the first paper published in 2005. Other methodologies are similarly limited in scope. Nonetheless, these functional neuroimaging studies suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure, or a diagnosis of FAS, may lead to restrictions in neural efficiency or a global decrement in processing resources. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure has numerous effects on the developing brain, including damage to selective brain structure. We review structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of brain abnormalities in subjects prenatally exposed to alcohol. The most common findings include reduced brain volume and malformations of the corpus callosum. Advanced methods have been able to detect shape, thickness and displacement changes throughout multiple brain regions. The teratogenic effects of alcohol appear to be widespread, affecting almost the entire brain. The only region that appears to be relatively spared is the occipital lobe. More recent studies have linked cognition to the underlying brain structure in alcohol-exposed subjects, and several report patterns in the severity of brain damage as it relates to facial dysmorphology or to extent of alcohol exposure. Future studies exploring relationships between brain structure, cognitive measures, dysmorphology, age, and other variables will be valuable for further comprehending the vast effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and for evaluating possible interventions. © 2011 The Author(s).

N2  - The characteristic facial features of the more severe end of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) include smooth philtrum, thin vermillion of the upper lip, and short palpebral fissures. A systematic evaluation of a comprehensive list of minor structural defects in association with varying patterns of prenatal exposure to alcohol has not been performed. We examined the patterns and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure to minor structural malformations occurring in at least 5% of the sample. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0-6 weeks post-conception, 6-12 weeks post-conception, first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester. Naevus flammeus neonatorum is significantly associated with various patterns of drinking during the second half of the first trimester (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04, 1.24 for average number of drinks per day; RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.07 for number of binge episodes; RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01, 1.15 for maximum number of drinks in one episode) and similar for number of binge episodes in all categories of timing of exposure and in the second trimester for average number of drinks per day. Other minor malformations occurring in at least 5% of the sample were not found to be significantly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Expected minor malformations were not found to be significantly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Naevus flammeus neonatorum appears to be part of the spectrum of features associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to cause significant cognitive and attentional dysfunction. Given the relationship between default mode network (DMN) activity and task-related attentional modulation, it is possible that PAE affects activity of this network. In the present study, task-related deactivation as well as structural and resting state functional connectivity of the DMN were examined using diffusional tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging in non-dysmorphic and dysmorphic PAE populations and compared to healthy controls. The dysmorphic PAE group was found to have reduced DMN deactivation as compared to controls, indicating poorer attentional modulation during the cognitive task. Additionally, structural connectivity and baseline functional connectivity were lower in both PAE groups as compared to controls. Primarily the findings suggest that learning problems seen with PAE may be a combination of general attentional and specific cognitive deficits. A secondary implication is that DMN activity is affected to varying extents depending on the degree of PAE. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a wide range of neurocognitive effects. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC), which involves temporal pairing of a conditioned with an unconditioned stimulus, has been shown to be a potential biomarker of fetal alcohol exposure. A growing body of evidence suggests that white matter may be a specific target of alcohol teratogenesis, and the neural circuitry underlying EBC is known to involve the cerebellar peduncles. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that has proven useful for assessing central nervous system white matter integrity. This study used DTI to examine the degree to which the fetal alcohol-related deficit in EBC may be mediated by structural impairment in the cerebellar peduncles. Methods: Thirteen children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and 12 matched controls were scanned using DTI and structural MRI sequences. The DTI data were processed using a voxelwise technique, and the structural data were used for volumetric analyses. Prenatal alcohol exposure group and EBC performance were examined in relation to brain volumes and outputs from the DTI analysis. Results: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and perpendicular diffusivity group differences between alcohol-exposed and nonexposed children were identified in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. Alcohol exposure correlated with lower FA and greater perpendicular diffusivity in this region, and these correlations remained significant even after controlling for total brain and cerebellar volumes. Conversely, trace conditioning performance was related to higher FA and lower perpendicular diffusivity in the left middle peduncle. The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on trace conditioning was partially mediated by lower FA in this region. Conclusions: This study extends recent findings that have used DTI to reveal microstructural deficits in white matter in children with FASD. This is the first DTI study to demonstrate mediation of a fetal alcohol-related effect on neuropsychological function by deficits in white matter integrity.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause several cognitive and behavioral difficulties. Few studies have investigated the associations with infant temperament or sleeping patterns. Our aim was to study potential associations between early prenatal binge exposure and infant temperament and sleeping pattern. Methods: In a population based longitudinal study, representative of pregnant women in Oslo, questionnaires were answered at 17 and 30. weeks of pregnancy and 6. months after term. Two factors, difficult temperament and sleeping problems, were identified using Principal Component Analysis and dichotomized at the least optimal 14-15%. Logistic regression analyses identified predictive factors. Results: Maternal binge drinking (>. 5 drinks per occasion) once a week during pregnancy week 0-6 significantly predicted both difficult temperament (Odds Ratio OR 3.3**; 95% Confidence interval CI 1.4-7.9) and sleeping problems (OR 5.3**; 95% CI 2.1-13.7) in the infant, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Including binge drinking more often than once a week, further increased the OR of sleeping problems (6.0***; 2.7-13.7). Prenatal maternal depressive symptoms also predicted both outcomes. Reduced birth weight predicted difficult temperament. Maternal satisfaction with life reduced the probability of sleeping problems. Maternal smoking, and work stress, during pregnancy had no predictive power. The results were not explained by binge drinking later during pregnancy or higher consumption per occasion. Conclusions: Binge drinking once a week during pregnancy week 0-6 had stronger predictive power of difficult temperament and sleeping problems during infancy, than other covariates. The findings support advising women to avoid binge drinking when planning pregnancy. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - New patterns of alcohol drinking are leading to a significant increase in alcohol damage. Epidemiological data show lowering age of first alcohol use that in Italy is close to 12 ys, and an increasing number of female drinkers. The latest evidence indicates a higher risk for female pathologies and for alcohol drinking during pregnancy with consequent foetal alcohol exposure. In the western countries, prenatal alcohol exposure is the main preventable cause of mental retardation in children. Alcohol produces negative effects on foetal development globally defined FASD (Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders) and the major consequence is FAS (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). Recent epidemiological studies show that FAS and FASD are present in Italy and are surely underestimated. Some aspects of alcohol-related problems in paediatric age are discussed in the present article together with recent perspectives in the study on new biomarkers. However, prevention is the mainstay where paediatricians may have a pivotal role in recognizing and treating alcohol disease in the newborn and in the early adolescent promptly.

N2  - Objective: Effective preconception primary prevention strategies are needed for women who are at dual risk for alcohol and smoking exposed pregnancies. The current study seeks to identify risk factors that can be used to target intervention strategies at women who are at dual risk. Methods: During a 2-year period from January 2007 through December 2009, 109 women at dual risk for alcohol exposed pregnancy (AEP) and smoking exposed pregnancy (SEP) and 108 women at risk only for AEP were recruited from central Virginia cities. All participants completed a battery of instruments, including assessments of sexual, smoking, and alcohol history and current behavior in each area. Results: Several factors differentiated women at dual risk for SEP/AEP vs. AEP alone, including lower educational level and employment, higher frequency of sexual intercourse, less use of contraception, and higher frequency of alcohol use and mental disorders. Conclusions: Several measurable factors differentiate SEP/AEP women, and these factors could be used to efficiently target primary prevention. The increased severity of women at dual risk of SEP/AEP on a variety of factors demonstrates the importance of preconception prevention efforts for these women. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is common with about 80,000 women continuing to drink through all three trimesters of pregnancy each year. PAE is also associated with postnatal adversities, including abuse and neglect, which increase risk for foster care placement. Each day 700 children enter the foster care system. A diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) also increases the risk for foster care placement. Among children diagnosed with FASD 70% are or have been in foster care. FASD prevalence rates are increased 10- to 15-fold in foster care systems. Foster care is an important opportunity to detect FASD and provide services to infants and children with FASD. FASD is the third most common identifiable cause of mental retardation in the United States. We describe a court-team-based model of care developed to improve management of children with PAE or FASD entering foster care. The programmatic objectives include: enhancing detection of PAE; screening for FASD; increased consideration of FASD as a potential issue in treatment planning with foster parents; improved entry into treatment; and increased surveillance for parents with an FASD. © 2011 by Federal Legal Publications, Inc.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are treated differently by the criminal justice system in sex offense prosecutions, depending upon whether they are categorized as victims or perpetrators. The primary and secondary disabilities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure are often taken into consideration when assessing the capacity of a victim to consent to sexual activity, but generally not considered in determining whether a defendant had the mens rea to engage in criminal sexual conduct. This article traces the historical underpinnings of the mens rea requirement in criminal law and discusses its elimination in most prosecutions for statutory rape. The article recommends that additional research be conducted to determine the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on an individual's capacity to consent to sexual activity. It suggests that fundamental principles of culpability require an examination of how FASD impacts an individual's capacity to engage in meaningful, responsible, decision making about sexual activity before criminal sanctions are imposed. © 2011 by Federal Legal Publications, Inc.

T1  - Childhood behavioural and developmental disorders - association with maternal alcohol consumption in Cape Town, South Africa

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Current maternal alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, is strongly associated with childhood behavioural and/or developmental disorders (BDDs) in a population attending tertiary hospital ambulatory services. BDDs were also associated with maternal alcohol use 6 months before pregnancy. An association with BDDs could not be conclusively demonstrated for drinking during pregnancy, but this may have been influenced by underreporting and reduced study power due to misclassification of exposure. We cannot rule out the a priori suspicion that some mild BDDs in children in the Western Cape could be undiagnosed fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Nonetheless, the study highlighted the important impact of current maternal alcohol use on behaviour and development of children. Future research on the impact of maternal alcohol use on childhood development should include examination of environmental and social factors contributing to this increased risk. Upstream interventions aimed at reducing alcohol-related harms may also contribute to reducing the burden of BDDs.

N2  - The knowledge of the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy isn't indeed a new issue, but the recent evidences of ethyl-glucuronide and ethyl-sulfate in meconium as novel biomarkers of prenatal ethanol exposure open new perspectives for the early diagnosis of the alcohol-related birth defects. This is crucial for a better developmental outcome of the affected patients and for preventing additional cases in at risk families. The fetal alcohol syndrome is not a single entity but represents the most severe form of a spectrum of disorders, including distinctive craniofacial alterations, stunted growth and behavioral abnormalities, caused by complex gene-environment interactions. FAS must always be a diagnosis of exclusion and have to be differentiated from many conditions caused by other embryotoxin agents and genetic syndromes that share some phenotypic features. Even if the first trimester is considered the most vulnerable period, nowadays is known that a fetal damage might occur throughout all gestation. Since ethanol consumption is constantly increasing among young women, a substantial amount of work has to be made to implement the knowledge on alcohol fetal effects among women of childbearing age; moreover, awareness and training among professionals in the health care system might play a critical role in the early diagnosis of these serious conditions. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Background. High numbers of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) have been described as having mental health problems. Aims.This article summarizes research about mental health problems in FASD and considers related developmental and environmental issues. Method. A computer-based literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Academic Search Complete, and Education Resources Information Centre for articles addressing the prevalence and types of mental health issues in individuals affected by FASD. Results. High rates of mental disorders within the FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) population were found to be consistently reported for both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Moreover, problems that emerge in childhood may reflect a convergence of genetic, environmental, and neurophysiological factors that persist into adulthood. Conclusions. Researchers are beginning to document the impacts of PAE on later mental health development. Further longitudinal study is needed to determine whether there is an increasing severity of mental health deficits and consequences with age, and whether any such changes reflect increasingly deteriorating environmental factors or brain-based factors. Additionally, research is needed to design interventions to better address the unique mental health needs of this population. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Ethanol-induced neuro-developmental abnormalities are associated with impaired insulin and IGF signaling, and increased oxidative stress in CNS neurons. We examined the roles of ethanol and its principal toxic metabolite, acetaldehyde, as mediators of impaired insulin/IGF signaling and oxidative injury in immature cerebellar neurons. Cultures were exposed to 3.5mM acetaldehyde or 50mM ethanol +/- 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), an inhibitor of ethanol metabolism, and viability, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and insulin responsiveness were measured 48 hours later. Acetaldehyde or ethanol increased neuronal death and levels of 8-OHdG and 4-HNE, and reduced mitochondrial function. Ethanol inhibited insulin responsiveness, whereas acetaldehyde did not. 4-MP abated ethanol-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, but failed to restore insulin responsiveness. Furthermore, alcohol and aldehyde metabolizing enzyme genes were inhibited by prenatal ethanol exposure; this effect was mediated by acetaldehyde and not ethanol + 4MP. These findings suggest that brain insulin resistance in prenatal alcohol exposure is caused by direct effects of ethanol, whereas oxidative stress induced neuronal injury is likely mediated by ethanol and its toxic metabolites. Moreover, the adverse effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on brain development may be exacerbated by down-regulation of genes needed for metabolism and detoxification of alcohol in the brain.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) occurs in children of mothers consuming alcohol during pregnancy. The recent statement of NOFAS (National Organization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) and FASD Center of Excellence in Washington DC of April 15th, 2004 has the following wording: "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a broad term describing a wide range of developmental outcomes among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure. The outcomes may include physical, mental, cognitive and behavioural anomalies; and they may persist across the lifespan. The term FASD is not intended for use as a clinical diagnosis". As a result of alcohol intoxication during the prenatal development the fetus is damaged at the cellular level, which results in a malformation of the central nervous system and internal organs. The most dangerous consequence of the prenatal alcohol damage is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Developmental disorders of children with FASD occur in different areas. These include: abnormal cognitive development (problems with memory, hyper-activity, planning, anticipation, skills learning), problems with emotions, especially in social situations (withdrawal or aggression, a tendency to steal and lie, avoidance of responsibility, credulity, over-confidence and lack of reflection). Currently used diagnostic criteria are still based on the triad of the following clinical symptoms: 1. characteristic facial features; 1. growth deficiency; 1. central nervous system abnormalities. The outcomes of the teratogenic (toxic for fetus) impact of alcohol exposure depend on the following: * Amount of alcohol (Note! Even a very small amount of alcohol may in certain circumstances be dangerous). * Phase of pregnancy - in each trimester some specific damage typical for a given moment of fetus development may take place. In the first trimester alcohol exposure can lead to growth retardation and development of dysmorphia, in the second and third trimester the central nervous system is mostly vulnerable and there is a disturbed neurotransmitters production. * Mother's general health condition (nutritional status, genetic predisposition, immune system). Children of drinking mothers who did not present all the symptoms of damage (dysmorphia) were initially described as the FAE children (fetal alcohol effects). The aim of this study is to analyse the clinical picture of depression on the basis of the case of a 12-year-old boy. The authors describe the symptoms presented by him and give understanding of the patient in the individual context, as well as in relationship with his mother, and discuss his drawing. They propose a psychotherapy treatment.

N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to ethanol can produce a complex set of effects on fetal development, which is denominated fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Early detection of ethanol exposure can allow the prevention of some relevant adverse effects associated to FASD. Objectives: The aim of this work was to review the main toxic effects of ethanol on the neonate and the available biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: A bibliographic search was performed in PubMed employing the terms "effects maternal ethanol exposure" and "biomarkers ethanol prenatal exposure" and cross references. Results: Many adverse effects on fetal development were described, especially deficits in the central nervous system. The biomarkers of ethanol exposure more widely described were fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS), being meconium and hair the most common biological matrices for laboratorial evaluation. Discussion: The early detection of alcohol exposure in intra-uterine life is useful to prevent the secondary effects of FASD through pharmacologic and educational intervention in affected children.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is thought to be the most prevalent nongenetic cause of a wide range of neurodevelopmental deficits. Insufficient thyroid hormone levels are one mechanism that hampers development of the alcohol-exposed brain, and we hypothesized that altered dosage of the imprinted thyroid hormone-inactivating gene deiodinase-III (Dio3) is responsible. To follow parent-of-origin allelic expression of Dio3 in the fetal and adult offspring of alcohol-consuming and control dams, we reciprocally crossed 2 polymorphic rat strains. In the frontal cortex, prenatal alcohol exposure altered imprinting patterns and total expression of Dio3 in the fetus and produced a permanent hypothyroid milieu in the adult. In the hippocampus, alcohol affected the paternal and total expression of Dio3 in the fetus and in the adult male, where thyroid hormone levels were concomitantly increased. Hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits were identified exclusively in males, suggesting they are dependent on aberrant allelic Dio3 expression. None of these effects were observed in offspring of the reciprocal cross. Thus, genetic background and sex modify vulnerability to prenatal alcohol via brain region-specific expression of Dio3. This finding implies that phenotypic heterogeneity in human fetal alcohol spectrum disorder can be linked to genetic vulnerability in affected brain regions. © FASEB.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a range of disabilities caused by gestational exposure of the fetus to alcohol. Alcohol consumption in Israel has increased dramatically in the last decades. Our previous study revealed limited knowledge among Israeli medical professionals of the risks and potential long-term effects of FASD. Objectives: To evaluate the awareness and knowledge of women regarding the current recommendations on alcohol consumption during pregnancy, evaluate how many of the women received information regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy from medical professionals, and their personal drinking habits during pregnancy. Methods: A cross-sectional sample of new mothers in 3 large hospitals in Israel were asked to complete an ad hoc questionnaire on aspects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results: A total of 3815 women of mean age 30.4 years participated in the study; 82% were Jewish. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported by 14.1%, including more than 17% of the Jewish women, 11.1% of the Christian women, and none of the Muslim women. Rates were higher among nonsecular and younger women and first-time mothers. 71.6% of the sample claimed that women should not drink alcohol at all during pregnancy, and 21.4% thought that it was permissible if limited to 2 drinks per week. Seventy-five percent had received no formal information from medical professionals regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Conclusions: Alcohol consumption is frequent among pregnant women in Israel, especially young secular Jewish women with first pregnancies. Improved educational programs on the dangers of FASD are needed for both professionals and the general public. © 2011 Canadian Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Many pregnant women continue to drink alcohol despite clinical recommendations and public health campaigns about the risks associated with alcohol use during pregnancy. This review examines the predictors of prenatal alcohol use, with the long-term goal of developing more effective preventive efforts. Methods: A literature search of several databases for relevant articles was undertaken. Studies were included if they occurred in the context of antenatal care, collected data during the woman's pregnancy (between 1999 and 2009), investigated predictors of any drinking, had a population-based orientation (e.g., did not focus only on high-risk drinkers), and were published in English in a scientific peer-reviewed journal between 1999 and 2009. Results: Fourteen studies published between 2002 and 2009 fulfilled the inclusion criteria (United States, 4; Europe, 4; Australia and New Zealand, 3; Japan, 2; and Uganda, 1). The predictors of prenatal alcohol use most consistently identified were prepregnancy alcohol consumption and having been abused or exposed to violence. Less consistent predictors of drinking during pregnancy were high income/social class and positive dependence screen. Unemployment, marital status, and education level were examined in many studies but found to be predictive only infrequently. Conclusions: Women's prepregnancy alcohol consumption (i.e., quantity and frequency of typical drinking) and exposure to abuse or violence were consistently associated with drinking during pregnancy. Antenatal care providers should assess these factors for improved detection of women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

T1  - Molecular and behavioral aspects of the actions of alcohol on the adult and developing brain
A1  - Alfonso-Loeches S.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The brain is one of the major target organs of alcohol actions. Alcohol abuse can lead to alterations in brain structure and functions and, in some cases, to neurodegeneration. Cognitive deficits and alcohol dependence are highly damaging consequences of alcohol abuse. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to alcohol, and that drinking during gestation can lead to a range of physical, learning and behavioral defects (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders), with the most dramatic presentation corresponding to fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent findings also indicate that adolescence is a stage of brain maturation and that heavy drinking at this stage can have a negative impact on brain structure and functions causing important short-and long-term cognitive and behavioral consequences. The effects of alcohol on the brain are not uniform; some brain areas or cell populations are more vulnerable than others. The prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, the white matter and glial cells are particularly susceptible to the effects of ethanol. The molecular actions of alcohol on the brain are complex and involve numerous mechanisms and signaling pathways. Some of the mechanisms involved are common for the adult brain and for the developing brain, while others depend on the developmental stage. During brain ontogeny, alcohol causes irreversible alterations to the brain structure. It also impairs several molecular, neurochemical and cellular events taking place during normal brain development, including alterations in both gene expression regulation and the molecules involved in cella"cell interactions, interference with the mitogenic and growth factor response, enhancement of free radical formation and derangements of glial cell functions. However, in both adult and adolescent brains, alcohol damages specific brain areas through mechanisms involving excitotoxicity, free radical formation and neuroinflammatory damage resulting from activation of the innate immune system mediated by TLR4 receptors. Alcohol also acts on specific membrane proteins, such as neurotransmitter receptors (e.g. NMDA, GABA-A), ion channels (e.g. L-type Ca2+ channels, GIRKs), and signaling pathways (e.g. PKA and PKC signaling). These effects might underlie the wide variety of behavioral effects induced by ethanol drinking. The neuroadaptive changes affecting neurotransmission systems which are more sensitive to the acute effects of alcohol occur after long-term alcohol consumption. Alcohol-induced maladaptations in the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, abnormal plastic changes in the reward-related brain areas and genetic and epigenetic factors may all contribute to alcohol reinforcement and alcohol addiction. This manuscript reviews the mechanisms by which ethanol impacts the adult and the developing brain, and causes both neural impairments and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. The identification and the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ethanol toxicity might contribute to the development of treatments and/or therapeutic agents that could reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of alcohol on the brain. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a range of disabilities caused by gestational exposure of the fetus to alcohol. Alcohol consumption in Israel has increased dramatically in the last decades. Our previous study revealed limited knowledge among Israeli medical professionals of the risks and potential long-term effects of FASD. Objectives To evaluate the awareness and knowledge of women regarding the current recommendations on alcohol consumption during pregnancy, evaluate how many of the women received information regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy from medical professionals, and their personal drinking habits during pregnancy. Methods A cross-sectional sample of new mothers in 3 large hospitals in Israel were asked to complete an ad hoc questionnaire on aspects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results A total of 3815 women of mean age 30.4 years participated in the study; 82% were Jewish. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported by 14.1%, including more than 17% of the Jewish women, 11.1% of the Christian women, and none of the Muslim women. Rates were higher among nonsecular and younger women and first-time mothers. 71.6% of the sample claimed that women should not drink alcohol at all during pregnancy, and 21.4% thought that it was permissible if limited to 2 drinks per week. Seventy-five percent had received no formal information from medical professionals regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Conclusions Alcohol consumption is frequent among pregnant women in Israel, especially young secular Jewish women with first pregnancies. Improved educational programs on the dangers of FASD are needed for both professionals and the general public. ©2011 Canadian Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics All rights reserved.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is a major, preventable cause of behavioral and cognitive deficits in children. Despite extensive research, a unique neurobehavioral profile for children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure remains elusive. A fundamental question that must be addressed is how genetic and environmental factors interact with gestational alcohol exposure to produce neurobehavioral and neurobiological deficits in children. The core objectives of the NeuroDevNet team in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is to create an integrated research program of basic and clinical investigations that will (1) identify genetic and epigenetic modifications that may be predictive of the neurobehavioral and neurobiological dysfunctions in offspring induced by gestational alcohol exposure and (2) determine the relationship between structural alterations in the brain induced by gestational alcohol exposure and functional outcomes in offspring. The overarching hypothesis to be tested is that neurobehavioral and neurobiological dysfunctions induced by gestational alcohol exposure are correlated with the genetic background of the affected child and/or epigenetic modifications in gene expression. The identification of genetic and/or epigenetic markers that are predictive of the severity of behavioral and cognitive deficits in children affected by gestational alcohol exposure will have a profound impact on our ability to identify children at risk. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Little is known about alcohol effects on the utero-placental compartment during pregnancy. For the first time, we utilized 2-D DIGE quantitative proteomics to evaluate the role of the uterus in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) pathogenesis. Uterine artery endothelial cells were isolated from pregnant ewes, FAC sorted, validated, and maintained in culture. To mimic maternal binge drinking patterns, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of alcohol (300. mg/dl) in a compensating sealed humidified chamber system equilibrated with aqueous alcohol for 3. h on 3 consecutive days for two weeks. CyDye switch combined with 2-D DIGE followed by MALDI-TOF and tandem MS/MS were utilized. Validation was performed using Western immunoblot analysis. Chronic binge-like alcohol significantly (P<0.05) decreased 30 proteins and increased 19 others. Gene-enrichment and functional annotation cluster analysis revealed significant enrichment (P<0.05) in three categories: glutathione S transferase, thioredoxin, and vesicle transport-related. Furthermore, alcohol differentially altered proteins with certain isoforms being downregulated while others were upregulated. In summary, binge alcohol has specific effects on the maternal uterine proteome, especially those related to oxidative stress. The current study also demonstrates a great need to utilize proteomic approaches for diagnostic, mechanistic and therapeutic aspects of FASD. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Children whose mothers consumed alcohol during pregnancy exhibit widespread brain abnormalities and a complex array of behavioral disturbances. Here, we used a mouse model of fetal alcohol exposure to investigate relationships between brain abnormalities and specific behavioral alterations during adulthood. Results: Mice drank a 10% ethanol solution throughout pregnancy. When fetal alcohol-exposed offspring reached adulthood, we used high resolution MRI to conduct a brain-wide screen for structural changes and found that the largest reduction in volume occurred in the olfactory bulbs. Next, we tested adult mice in an associative olfactory task and found that fetal alcohol exposure impaired discrimination between similar odors but left odor memory intact. Finally, we investigated olfactory bulb neurogenesis as a potential mechanism by performing an in vitro neurosphere assay, in vivo labeling of new cells using BrdU, and in vivo labeling of new cells using a transgenic reporter system. We found that fetal alcohol exposure decreased the number of neural precursor cells in the subependymal zone and the number of new cells in the olfactory bulbs during the first few postnatal weeks. Conclusions: Using a combination of techniques, including structural brain imaging, in vitro and in vivo cell detection methods, and behavioral testing, we found that fetal alcohol exposure results in smaller olfactory bulbs and impairments in odor discrimination that persist into adulthood. Furthermore, we found that these abnormalities in olfactory bulb structure and function may arise from deficits in the generation of new olfactory bulb neurons during early postnatal development. © 2011 Akers et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Regional cortical thickness was evaluated using CIVET processing of 3D T1-weighted images (i) to compare the variation in cortical thickness between 33 participants with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) aged 6-30 years (mean age 12.3. years) versus 33 age/sex/hand-matched controls, and (ii) to examine developmental changes in cortical thickness with age from children to young adults in both groups. Significant cortical thinning was found in the participants with FASD in large areas of the bilateral middle frontal lobe, pre- and post- central areas, lateral and inferior temporal and occipital lobes compared to controls. No significant cortical thickness increases were observed for the FASD group. Cortical thinning with age in a linear model was observed in both groups, but the locations were different for each group. FASD participants showed thinning with age in the left middle frontal, bilateral precentral, bilateral precuneus and paracingulate, left inferior occipital and bilateral fusiform gyri; while controls showed decreases with age in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precuneus gyrus, and bilateral occipital gyrus. A battery of cognitive assessments of memory, attention, motor, and verbal abilities was conducted with many of the FASD participants, but no significant correlations were found between these cognitive scores and regional cortical thickness. Non-invasive measurements of cortical thickness in children to young adults with FASD have identified both key regions of cortex that may be more deleteriously affected by prenatal alcohol exposure as well as cortical changes with age that differ from normal developmental thinning. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Exposure to alcohol during fetal development increases susceptibility to mammary cancer in adult rats. This study determined if early changes in mammary morphology and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/estradiol axis are involved in the mechanisms that underlie this increased susceptibility. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a liquid diet containing 6. 7% ethanol (alcohol), an isocaloric liquid diet (pair-fed), or rat chow ad libitum from days 11 to 21 of gestation. At birth, female pups were cross-fostered to ad libitum-fed control dams. Offspring were euthanized at postnatal days (PND) 20, 40, or 80. Animals were injected with BrdU before euthanasia, then mammary glands, serum, and livers were collected. Mammary glands from animals exposed to alcohol in utero displayed increased epithelial cell proliferation and aromatase expression at PND 20 and 40. Mammary IGF-I mRNA was higher in alcohol-exposed animals relative to controls at PND 20, while mammary IGFBP-5 mRNA was lower in this group at PND 40. Hepatic IGF-I mRNA expression was increased at all time points in alcohol-exposed animals, however, circulating IGF-I levels were not altered. These data indicate that alcohol exposure in utero may advance mammary development via the IGF and estradiol systems, which could contribute to increased susceptibility to mammary cancer later in life. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy causes a continuum of long-lasting disabilities in the offspring, commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is possibly the most common behavioral problem in children with FASD and devising strategies that ameliorate this condition has great clinical relevance. Studies in rodent models of ADHD and FASD suggest that impairments in the cAMP signaling cascade contribute to the hyperactivity phenotype. In this work, we investigated whether the cAMP levels are affected in a long-lasting manner by ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent period of human gestation and whether the acute administration of the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine ameliorates the ethanol-induced hyperactivity. Methods: From postnatal day (P) 2 to P8, Swiss mice either received ethanol (5. g/kg i.p.) or saline every other day. At P30, the animals either received vinpocetine (20. mg/kg or 10. mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle 4. h before being tested in the open field. After the test, frontal cerebral cortices and hippocampi were dissected and collected for assessment of cAMP levels. Results: Early alcohol exposure significantly increased locomotor activity in the open field and reduced cAMP levels in the hippocampus. The acute treatment of ethanol-exposed animals with 20. mg/kg of vinpocetine restored both their locomotor activity and cAMP levels to control levels. Conclusions: These data lend support to the idea that cAMP signaling system contribute to the hyperactivity induced by developmental alcohol exposure and provide evidence for the potential therapeutic use of vinpocetine in FASD. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Aim: To examine risk and protective factors associated with behavioural problems of children and adolescents following prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: A total of 73 children and adolescents with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were assessed for internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems using the Child Behavior Checklist. Linear regression models were used to determine the effects of diagnostic and environmental risk and protective factors on behaviour, while controlling for age, sex and IQ. Results: Length of time spent in residential care was the most pervasive risk factor associated with internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems. A low dysmorphology score was related to more internalizing and total problems. Conclusions: Children and adolescents prenatally exposed to alcohol faced greater risk of substantive behavioural problems (i) if they were less visibly alcohol affected and (ii) the longer time they had spent in residential care. The results underscore the clinical importance of appropriate services and care for less visibly affected children with FASD and highlight the need to attend to children with FASD being raised in institutions. © 2011 The Author(s)/Acta Paediatrica © 2011 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

N2  - Background: Ethanol consumption during pregnancy can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which consists of the complete spectrum of developmental deficits including neurological dysfunction. FASD is associated with a variety of neurobehavioral disturbances dependent on the age and duration of exposure. Ethanol exposure in neonatal rodents can also induce widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration and long-lasting behavioral abnormalities similar to FASD. The developmental stage of neonatal rodent brains that are at the peak of synaptogenesis is equivalent to the third trimester of human gestation. Methods: Male and female C57BL/6By mice were injected with ethanol (20%, 2.5g/kg, 2 s.c. injections) or an equal volume of saline (controls) on postnatal day 7 (P7). Animals were allowed to mature and at 3months were tested on an olfactory habituation task known to be dependent on piriform cortex function, a hippocampal-dependent object place memory task, and used for electrophysiological testing of spontaneous and odor-evoked local field potential (LFP) activity in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and dorsal hippocampus. Results: P7 ethanol induced widespread cell death within 1day of exposure, with highest levels in the neocortex, intermediate levels in the dorsal hippocampus, and relatively low levels in the primary olfactory system. No impairment of odor investigation or odor habituation was detected in P7 ethanol-exposed 3-month-old mice compared to saline controls. However, hippocampal-dependent object place memory was significantly impaired in the P7 ethanol-treated adult mice. Odor-evoked LFP activity was enhanced throughout the olfacto-hippocampal pathway, primarily within the theta frequency band, although the hippocampus also showed elevated evoked delta frequency activity. In addition, functional coherence between the piriform cortex and olfactory bulb and between the piriform cortex and dorsal hippocampus was enhanced in the beta frequency range in P7 ethanol-treated adult mice compared to controls. Conclusions: P7 ethanol induces an immediate wave of regionally selective cell death followed by long-lasting changes in local circuit and regional network function that are accompanied by changes in neurobehavioral performance. The results suggest that both the activity of local neural circuits within a brain region and the flow of information between brain regions can be modified by early alcohol exposure, which may contribute to long-lasting behavioral abnormalities known to rely on those circuits. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Previous research in South Africa revealed very high rates of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), of 46-89 per 1000 among young children. Maternal and child data from studies in this community summarize the multiple predictors of FAS and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS). Method: Sequential regression was employed to examine influences on child physical characteristics and dysmorphology from four categories of maternal traits: physical, demographic, childbearing, and drinking. Then, a structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to predict influences on child physical characteristics. Results: Individual sequential regressions revealed that maternal drinking measures were the most powerful predictors of a child's physical anomalies (R2=30, p<.001), followed by maternal demographics (R2=24, p<.001), maternal physical characteristics (R2=15, p<.001), and childbearing variables (R2=06, p<.001). The SEM utilized both individual variables and the four composite categories of maternal traits to predict a set of child physical characteristics, including a total dysmorphology score. As predicted, drinking behavior is a relatively strong predictor of child physical characteristics (beta=0.61, p<.001), even when all other maternal risk variables are included; higher levels of drinking predict child physical anomalies. Conclusions: Overall, the SEM model explains 62% of the variance in child physical anomalies. As expected, drinking variables explain the most variance. But this highly controlled estimation of multiple effects also reveals a significant contribution played by maternal demographics and, to a lesser degree, maternal physical and childbearing variables. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Alcohol and maternal uterine vascular adaptations during pregnancy-Part I: Effects of chronic in vitro binge-like alcohol on uterine endothelial nitric oxide system and function

N2  - Background: Pregnancy-induced utero-placental growth, angiogenic remodeling, and enhanced vasodilation are all partly regulated by estradiol-17beta-mediated activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production. However, very little is known about the effects of alcohol on these maternal utero-placental vascular adaptations during pregnancy and its potential role in the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In this study, we hypothesized that in vitro chronic binge-like alcohol will decrease uterine arterial endothelial eNOS expression and alter its multisite phosphorylation activity state via disruption of AKT signaling. To study the direct effects of alcohol on uterine vascular adaptations, we further investigated the effects of alcohol on estradiol-17beta-induced uterine angiogenesis in vitro. Methods: Uterine artery endothelial cells were isolated from pregnant ewes (gestational day 120 to 130; term=147), fluorescence-activated cell sorted, validated, and maintained in culture to passage 4. To mimic maternal binge drinking patterns, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of a lower (LD) or higher dose (HD) of alcohol in a compensating sealed humidified chamber system equilibrated with aqueous alcohol for 3hours on 3 consecutive days. Immunoblotting was performed to assess expression of NO system-associated proteins and eNOS multi-site phosphorylation. Following this treatment paradigm, control and binge alcohol-treated cells were passaged, grown for 2days, and then treated with increasing concentrations of estradiol-17beta (0.1, 1, 10, 100nM) in the absence or presence of LD or HD alcohol to evaluate estradiol-17beta-induced angiogenesis index using BrdU proliferation assay. Results: LD and HD binge-like alcohol decreased uterine arterial eNOS expression (p=0.009). eNOS multisite phosphorylation activation state was altered: P635eNOS was decreased (p=0.017), P1177eNOS was not altered, and P495eNOS exhibited an inverse U-shaped dose-dependent relationship with alcohol. LD and HD alcohol decreased the major eNOS-associated protein cav-1 (p<0.001). However, the commonly implicated AKT pathway did not correlate with eNOS posttranslational modifications. Assessment of uterine vascular adaptation via angiogenesis demonstrated that alcohol abrogated the dose-dependent proliferative effects of estradiol-17beta and thus blunted angiogenesis. Conclusions: Thus, the maternal uterine vasculature during pregnancy may be vulnerable to chronic binge-like alcohol. Altered eNOS multisite phosphorylation also suggests that alcohol produces specific effects at the level of posttranslational modifications critical for pregnancy-induced uterine vascular adaptations. Finally, the alcohol and estradiol-17beta data suggest a negative impact of alcohol on estrogen actions on the uterine vasculature. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in varying degrees of neurodevelopmental deficits, growth retardation, and facial dysmorphology. Variation in these adverse outcomes not only depends on the dose and pattern of alcohol exposure but also on less well understood interactions among environmental, genetic, and maternal factors. The current study tested the hypothesis that fetal genotype is an important determinant of ethanol teratogenesis by evaluating effects of ethanol exposure via embryo culture in 3 inbred strains of mice known to differ in the vulnerability of prenatal alcohol exposure in vivo. Methods: Three strains of mice, C57BL/6N (B6), DBA/2 (D2), and 129S6/SvEvTac (129S6) were assessed in a whole embryo culture beginning on embryonic day 8.25, with or without alcohol administration at 88mM for 6hours followed by 42hours culture in ethanol-free media. Results: Contrasting strain differences in susceptibility were observed for the brain, the face, and other organ systems using the Maele-Fabry and Picard scoring system. The forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, heart, optic vesicle, caudal neural tube, and hindlimbs of the B6 mice were severely delayed in growth, whereas compared to the respective controls, only the forebrain and optic vesicle were delayed in the D2 mice, and no effects were found in the 129S6 mice. A large number of cleaved (c)-caspase 3 positive (+) cells were found in regions of the brain, optic vesicles, cranial nerve nuclei V, VII, VIII, and IX as well as the craniofacial primordial; only a few were found in corresponding regions of the B6 controls. In contrast, only a small number of c-caspase 3 immunostaining cells were found in either the alcohol treated or the controls of the D2 embryos and in 129S6 embryos. The independent apoptotic markers TUNEL and Nile blue staining further confirmed the strain differences in apoptotic responses in both the neural tube and craniofacial primordia. Conclusions: Under embryo culture conditions, in which alcohol exposure factors and fetal developmental staging were controlled, and maternal and intrauterine factors were eliminated, the degree of growth retardation and the extent and type of neurodevelopmental teratogenesis varied significantly across strains. Notably, the 129S6 strain was remarkably resistant to alcohol-induced growth deficits, confirming a previous in vivo study, and the D2 strain was also significantly less affected than the B6 strain. These findings demonstrate that fetal genotype is an important factor that can contribute to the variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have deficits in verbal learning and recall. However, the specificity of these deficits has not been adequately tested. In the current study, verbal learning and memory performance of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was compared to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a disorder commonly seen in alcohol-exposed children. Methods: Performance on the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C) was examined in 3 groups of children (N=22/group): (i) heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD (ALC), (ii) nonexposed with ADHD (ADHD), and (iii) nonexposed typically developing (CON). Groups were matched on age, sex, race, ethnicity, handedness, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results: Group differences were noted on learning trials (CON>ADHD>ALC). On the delayed recall trial, CON children performed better than both clinical groups, who did not differ from each other. Children in the ALC group demonstrated poorer recognition than children in the CON and ADHD groups, who did not differ from each other. Marginally significant group differences were noted on retention of previously learned material. Post hoc analyses indicated that ADHD children showed worse retention relative to the CON group, whereas retention in the ALC children remained intact. Conclusions: These data suggest that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and nonexposed children with ADHD show differential patterns of deficit on the CVLT-C. Performance of alcohol-exposed children reflects inefficient encoding of verbal material, whereas performance of the ADHD group may be better characterized by a deficit in retrieval of learned material. Differences noted between clinical groups add to a growing neurobehavioral profile of FASD that may aid in differential diagnosis. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: MRI studies, including recent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies, have shown corpus callosum abnormalities in children prenatally exposed to alcohol, especially in the posterior regions. These abnormalities appear across the range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have demonstrated cognitive correlates of callosal abnormalities in FASD including deficits in visual-motor skill, verbal learning, and executive functioning. The goal of this study was to determine whether inter-hemispheric structural connectivity abnormalities in FASD are associated with disrupted inter-hemispheric functional connectivity and disrupted cognition. Methods: Twenty-one children with FASD and 23 matched controls underwent a 6-minute resting-state functional MRI scan as well as anatomical imaging and DTI. Using a semi-automated method, we parsed the corpus callosum and delineated 7 inter-hemispheric white matter tracts with DTI tractography. Cortical regions of interest (ROIs) at the distal ends of these tracts were identified. Right-left correlations in resting fMRI signal were computed for these sets of ROIs, and group comparisons were made. Correlations with facial dysmorphology, cognition, and DTI measures were computed. Results: A significant group difference in inter-hemispheric functional connectivity was seen in a posterior set of ROIs, the para-central region. Children with FASD had functional connectivity that was 12% lower than in controls in this region. Subgroup analyses were not possible owing to small sample size, but the data suggest that there were effects across the FASD spectrum. No significant association with facial dysmorphology was found. Para-central functional connectivity was significantly correlated with DTI mean diffusivity, a measure of microstructural integrity, in posterior callosal tracts in controls but not in FASD. Significant correlations were seen between these structural and functional measures, and Wechsler perceptual reasoning ability. Conclusions: Inter-hemispheric functional connectivity disturbances were observed in children with FASD relative to controls. The disruption was measured in medial parietal regions (para-central) that are connected by posterior callosal fiber projections. We have previously shown microstructural abnormalities in these same posterior callosal regions, and the current study suggests a possible relationship between the two. These measures have clinical relevance as they are associated with cognitive functioning. Copyright © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to neurodevelopmental impairments and disrupt several neurotransmitter systems. We examined the timing of moderate level alcohol exposure, serotonin transporter gene polymorphic region variation (rh5-HTTLPR), and levels of primary serotonin and dopamine (DA) metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in rhesus monkeys. Methods: Thirty-two 30-month old rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from 4 groups of females were assessed: (i) early alcohol-exposed group (n=9), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6g/kg/d alcohol solution on gestational days 0 to 50; (ii) middle-to-late gestation alcohol-exposed group (n=6), mothers consumed 0.6g/kg/d alcohol solution on gestational days 50 to 135; (iii) a continuous-exposure group (n=8), mothers consumed 0.6g/kg/d alcohol solution on gestational days 0 to 135; and (iv) controls (n=9), mothers consumed an isocaloric control solution on gestational days 0 to 50, 50 to 135, or 0 to 135. Serotonin transporter promoter region allelic variants (homozygous s/s or heterozygous s/l vs. homozygous l/l) were determined. We examined CSF concentrations of the 5-HT and DA metabolites, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), respectively, at baseline and 50hours after separation from cage-mates, when the monkeys were 30months old. Results: Early- and middle-to-late gestation-alcohol exposed monkeys carrying the short allele had lower concentrations of 5-HIAA in CSF relative to other groups. Concentrations of 5-HIAA in CSF were lower for s allele carriers and increased from baseline relative to pre-separation values, whereas 5-HIAA levels in l/l allele carriers were not affected by separation. Monkeys carrying the short allele had lower basal concentrations of HVA in CSF compared with monkeys homozygous for the long allele. Conclusion: Carrying the s allele of the 5-HT transporter increased the probability of reduced 5-HIAA in early- and middle-to-late gestation alcohol-exposed monkeys and reduced HVA at baseline. These findings that prenatal alcohol exposure altered central 5-HT activity in genetically sensitive monkeys raise questions about whether abnormal serotonin biological pathways could underlie some of the psychiatric disorders reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

N2  - Background: To date, no studies have used population-level data to investigate whether maternal location of residence (metropolitan vs. regional/remote populations) is associated with alcohol use in pregnancy. This information has important implications for appropriate service provision. Methods: Information on all live births in New South Wales Australia was linked to records of alcohol-related admissions for mothers of these births over a 6-year period (2000 to 2006). Cases were women who had at least 1 alcohol-related hospital admission during pregnancy or at birth. Controls were women who had at least 1 live birth over that same time period but no alcohol-related hospital admissions during that time. Admissions were considered to be alcohol-related based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) code. Demographic, obstetric, and neonatal variables were compared. Results: A total of 417,464 singleton birth records were analyzed, 488 of which were coded positive for at least 1 alcohol-related ICD-10-AM diagnosis. Characteristics associated with alcohol-related admissions in pregnancy were residence in a remote/very remote area, being Australian-born, having had a previous pregnancy, smoking in the current pregnancy, and presenting late to antenatal care. Alcohol-exposed pregnancies were associated with a range of poor obstetric and neonatal outcomes, with no geographic differences noted. However, women in regional/remote areas were less likely to attend specialist obstetric hospitals. Conclusions: This study shows the need for standardized screening programs for alcohol use in pregnancy and where problematic use is detected, for clear clinical guidelines on management and referral. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Objective. To systematically review the available evidence on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on motor function in humans. Design. Systematic review. Population. Pregnant women and their offspring. Methods. The search strategy included Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and Scopus. The authors read titles and abstracts, and the articles that met the predefined criteria for inclusion were obtained and the full text read. The articles were assessed for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Main outcome measures. Motor function measured on standardized or validated tests. Results. The search resulted in 311 titles and abstracts, of which 39 were found relevant for inclusion. The findings of this review suggest a negative effect when the maternal consumption exceeded a certain level. Of all studies reporting a maternal intake of more than four drinks/day, only one study showed no effect on motor function, and of all studies reporting intake levels of less than 10 drinks/week, only one study showed deficit on the children's motor function. Conclusions. While it appears consistent that high daily alcohol intake is associated with deficits in gross and fine motor function, and low weekly intake is not associated with such deficits, the issue of binge drinking is unsettled. © 2010 The Authors Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica© 2010 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

N2  - Background: Poor arithmetic performance is among the most sensitive outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure and is also common in individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We hypothesized that prenatal alcohol exposure would be associated with deficits in the most fundamental aspects of number processing, representation of quantity and distance, whereas ADHD would be associated with deficits in calculation, the form of number processing most dependent on attention and memory. Methods: Two hundred and sixty-two inner-city, African American adolescents, who had been evaluated prospectively for prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD, were assessed on a number-processing test comprised of 7 subtests. Results: More heavily alcohol-exposed adolescents were 4 times more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD than those whose mothers abstained from alcohol use during pregnancy. Two dimensions of number processing were identified in a factor analysis-magnitude comparison and calculation. As hypothesized, prenatal alcohol exposure was more strongly related to the former and ADHD to the latter. Moreover, the relation of prenatal alcohol to calculation was fully mediated by magnitude comparison, whereas the relation of ADHD to calculation was mediated by IQ but not by magnitude comparison. Conclusion: These data confirm findings from previous studies identifying arithmetic as a particularly sensitive developmental endpoint for prenatal alcohol exposure. Whereas difficulties with arithmetic in ADHD are mediated by domain-general deficits in overall cognitive ability, fetal alcohol-related arithmetic difficulties are mediated primarily by a specific deficit in the core quantity system involving the ability to mentally represent and manipulate number. These data suggest that different interventions are likely to be effective for remediating arithmetic problems in children with prenatal alcohol exposure than in non-exposed children with ADHD. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is a cause of congenital brain malformations such as hydrocephalus; however, a complete mechanism accounting for this phenomenon has yet to be discovered. We report a case of a newborn who was exposed to alcohol throughout pregnancy and presented with low serum vitamin A and hydrocephalus. To our knowledge, the connection between prenatal ethanol exposure, vitamin A deficiency, and a developmental brain anomaly has never been described in humans before. A possible mechanism may be mediated by disruption of the homeostasis of vitamin A, an important morphogen in the developing nervous system. This, in turn, compromises the activity of the floor plate, a structure in charge of polarization and midline formation in the neural tube. We conclude that vitamin A screening and supplementation might be recommended for newborns of mothers who ingested ethanol during pregnancy. © 2011 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can damage the developing fetus, illustrated by central nervous system dysfunction and deficits in motor and cognitive abilities. Binge drinking has been associated with an increased risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, likely due to increased episodes of ethanol withdrawal. We hypothesized that overactivity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor during ethanol withdrawal leads to excitotoxic cell death in the developing brain. Consistent with this, administration of NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., MK-801) during withdrawal can attenuate ethanol's teratogenic effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, during ethanol withdrawal could effectively attenuate ethanol-related deficits, without the adverse side effects associated with other NMDA receptor antagonists. Methods: Sprague-Dawley pups were exposed to 6.0g/kg ethanol or isocaloric maltose solution via intubation on postnatal day 6, a period of brain development equivalent to a portion of the 3rd trimester. Twenty-four and 36hours after ethanol, subjects were injected with 0, 10, or 15mg/kg memantine, totaling doses of 0, 20, or 30mg/kg. Motor coordination was tested on a parallel bar task and the total number of cerebellar Purkinje cells was estimated using unbiased stereology. Results: Alcohol exposure induced significant parallel bar motor incoordination and reduced Purkinje cell number. Memantine administration significantly attenuated both ethanol-associated motor deficits and cerebellar cell loss in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: Memantine was neuroprotective when administered during ethanol withdrawal. These data provide further support that ethanol withdrawal contributes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The in vitro generation of neural cells from human embryonic stem cells is a powerful tool to acquire better knowledge of the cellular and molecular events involved in early human neural and brain development under physiological and pathological conditions. Prenatal alcohol exposure can induce important anomalies in the developing brain, the embryogenesis being an important critical period for the craniofacial defects and mental disabilities associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Here, we report the generation of neural progenitors (NPs) from human embryonic stem cells. Neuroepithelial progenitors display the morphological and functional characteristics of their embryonic counterparts and the proper timing of neurons and glia cells generation. Immunocytochemical and real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction analyses reveal that cells appeared as clusters during neuroepithelial cell proliferation and that the genes associated with the neuroectodermal (Pax-6) and the endodermic (alpha-fetoprotein) lineages decreased in parallel to the upregulation of the genes of NPs (nestin and Tuj1), followed by their differentiation into neurons (MAP-2+, GABA+), oligodendrocytes [galactocerebroside (GalC+)], and astrocytes (GFAP+). We further demonstrate, for the first time, that human NPs express the endocannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and the enzymes involved in endocannabinoids synthesis (NAPE-PLD) and degradation (FAAH). Using this in vitro culture, we demonstrate that ethanol exposure impairs NPs survival, affects the differentiation of NPs into neurons and astrocytes, disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, and affects the expression of different genes associated with neural differentiation. The results provide new insights into the effects of ethanol on human embryogenesis and neuroprogenitors and offer an opportunity to delineate potential therapeutic strategies to restore early ethanol-induced brain damage. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background: Although many studies have documented deficits in general motor functioning in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), few have employed detailed measurements to explore the specific nature of such disabilities. This pilot study explores whether three-dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis may generate increased knowledge of the effect of intrauterine alcohol exposure on motor control processes by detecting atypical upper-limb movement pattern specificity in children with FAS relative to typically developing (TD) children.Methods: Left and right arm and head movements during a sequential unimanual goal-directed precision task in a sample of children with FAS and in TD children were registered by an optoelectronic tracking system (ProReflex, Qualisys Inc.).Results: Children with FAS demonstrated evidently poorer task performance compared with TD children. Additionally, analyses of arm movement kinematics revealed atypical spatio-temporal organization in the children with FAS. In general, they exhibited longer arm movement trajectories at both the proximal and distal level, faster velocities at the proximal level but slower at the distal level, and more segmented distal movements. Children with FAS also showed atypically augmented and fast head movements during the task performance.Conclusions: Findings indicate neuromotor deficits and developmental delay in goal-directed arm movements because of prenatal alcohol exposure. It is suggested that 3D kinematic analysis is a valid technique for furthering the understanding of motor control processes in children with FAS/fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. A combination with relevant neuroimaging techniques in future studies would enable a more clear-cut interpretation of how atypical movement patterns relate to underlying brain abnormalities. © 2010 The Author(s).

N2  - Background We assessed whether exposure to prenatal smoking or alcohol accelerates age of menarche (AOM) in offspring. Methods We studied a Danish cohort of 3169 singleton females born in April 1984April 1987. Linear regressions were conducted to examine associations between prenatal smoking or alcohol exposure and offsprings AOM on: (i) the daughters who provided data on both month and the year of menarche (n 1634) and (ii) the entire sample that provided at least the year of menarche (n 3169). We also examined associations between only pre-pregnancy smoking or childhood exposure to smoking and AOM. The full model was adjusted for maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, maternal age at childbirth, parental socio-economic status, parity, consumption of milk products during pregnancy and marital status. Results Among those who provided both year and month, AOM was accelerated by 2.8 months (95 CI in months: -5.3, -0.4) among those exposed to 10 cigarettes/day throughout pregnancy and by 4.1 months (95 CI in months: -7.7, -0.5) among those with mothers who quit smoking sometime during pregnancy, compared with the unexposed group after adjustment for covariates. Similar, but much weaker, associations were observed among girls whose mothers smoked 19cigarettes/day throughout pregnancy or whose fathers smoked compared with their unexposed counterparts after adjustment for covariates [-0.8 months (95 CI: -2.6, 1.0)]. No associations were observed between AOM and only pre-pregnancy smoking or only childhood exposure or prenatal alcohol exposure. Conclusions Our study indicates that heavy smoking throughout the pregnancy may be important in prenatal programming of AOM. © 2010 The Author.

T1  - Antagonism of orexin 1 receptors eliminates motor hyperactivity and improves homing response acquisition in juvenile rats exposed to alcohol during early postnatal period

N2  - Consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) include motor hyperactivity, disrupted sleep and cognitive deficits. Hypothalamic orexin (ORX)-synthesizing neurons are important for the maintenance of vigilance and regulation of motor activity but their hyperactivity may contribute to anxiety disorders. Using a rat model, we tested whether ORX plays a role in behavioral consequences of prenatal AE. Male rat pups received 2.625. g/kg of alcohol (AE group) intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). On PD12-14, they received daily injections of either the ORX-1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20. mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (V) during the lights-off period. On PD16, they were subjected to the homing response (HR) test. On PD17, their motor activity was monitored in a novel environment. The percentage of tests in which HR acquisition was not achieved and the number of trials needed to reach the shortest HR latency were higher, whereas the percentage of successful trials was lower, in AE-V than in S-V rats (p=0.0009-0.03). In contrast, these measures were not significantly different between AE-SB and either S-SB or S-V rats. Motor activity in AE-V rats was significantly higher than in S-V (p=0.003), S-SB (p=0.007) or AE-SB (p=0.02) rats, with no difference between S-SB and AE-SB group. Our findings suggest that excessive activity of ORX neurons contributes to motor hyperactivity and impaired HR acquisition following perinatal AE and that these symptoms may be alleviated by systemic antagonism of ORX-1 receptors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Background: In experimental models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), cerebellar hypoplasia and hypofoliation are associated with insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) resistance with impaired signaling through pathways that mediate growth, survival, plasticity, metabolism, and neurotransmitter function. To more directly assess the roles of impaired insulin and IGF signaling during brain development, we administered intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of si-RNA targeting the insulin receptor, (InR), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), or IGF-2R into postnatal day 2 (P2) Long Evans rat pups and examined the sustained effects on cerebellar function, structure, and neurotransmitter-related gene expression (P20). Results: Rotarod tests on P20 demonstrated significant impairments in motor function, and histological studies revealed pronounced cerebellar hypotrophy, hypoplasia, and hypofoliation in si-InR, si-IGF-1R, and si-IGF-2R treated rats. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that si-InR, and to a lesser extent si-IGF-2R, broadly inhibited expression of insulin and IGF-2 polypeptides, and insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 receptors in the brain. ELISA studies showed that si-InR increased cerebellar levels of tau, phospho-tau and beta-actin, and inhibited GAPDH. In addition, si-InR, si-IGF-1R, and si-IGF-2R inhibited expression of choline acetyltransferase, which mediates motor function. Although the ICV si-RNA treatments generally spared the neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor expression, si-InR and si-IGF-1R inhibited NT3, while si-IGF-1R suppressed BDNF. Conclusions: early postnatal inhibition of brain InR expression, and to lesser extents, IGF-R, causes structural and functional abnormalities that resemble effects of FASD. The findings suggest that major abnormalities in brains with FASD are mediated by impairments in insulin/IGF signaling. Potential therapeutic strategies to reduce the long-term impact of prenatal alcohol exposure may include treatment with agents that restore brain insulin and IGF responsiveness. © 2011 de la Monte et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes physical, cognitive and behavioural impairments in the child. Deficits are irreversible and persist into adulthood. It was the objective of this study to investigate the specific problems and challenges faced by young adults with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Patients: We examined the biographical development and living situation of 60 adult patients with FAS. In their childhood, all the patients had been diagnosed with FAS in the Muenster University hospital. Methods: Using a structured interview, we asked for the occupational career, health and social problems as well as the current living conditions of the patients. Results: Most patients lived in dependent circumstances. The occupational development was characterized by disruption and failure, and severe social problems were common in patients. 3 in 4 patients were victims of physical and sexual abuse. Conclusions: Due to the variety of impairments caused by prenatal alcohol exposure and the persisting inability to live independently, adults with FAS need intense care, support and assistance. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart  New York.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and the rate of conduct disorder in exposed compared with unexposed adolescents. Method: Data for these analyses are from a longitudinal study of prenatal substance exposures. Women were interviewed at their fourth and seventh prenatal months, and with their children, at birth, 8 and 18 months, 3, 6, 10, 14, and 16 years postpartum. Offspring were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview ScheduleIV; maternal and adolescent diagnoses were made using DSM-IV criteria at age 16 years. The sample was 592 adolescents and their mothers or caretakers. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure is significantly associated with an increased rate of conduct disorder in the adolescents. This effect was detected above an average exposure of one or more drinks per day in the first trimester. The effect remained significant after controlling for other significant variables including measures of the environment, maternal psychopathology, and other prenatal exposures. Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol use in the first trimester is a risk factor for conduct disorder in the exposed offspring. © 2011 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

N2  - Rationale: Early exposure to stress and teratogenic substances have an impact on brain structures involved in cognition and mental health. While moderate-to-high levels of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have repeatedly been associated with long-term neurodevelopmental deficits, no consensus has yet been reached on the detrimental effects of low-to-moderate PAE on the children's functioning, including the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Objectives: The study aims to examine the association between low PAE and cortisol response to unfamiliar situations in 19-month-old children and to determine whether this association was moderated by sex and testosterone levels. Methods: Information regarding PAE, cortisol response to unfamiliar situations, and testosterone activity was available in a total of 130 children participating to the Quebec Newborn Twin Study (Montreal, QC, Canada). Mother alcohol consumption during pregnancy was assessed via a semistructured interview conducted when the children were 6 months of age. The contribution of prenatal and postnatal confounds were examined. Results: Disrupted patterns of cortisol activity were observed only in PAE males. Testosterone tended to be negatively associated with the cortisol response, but not for PAE males, suggesting an altered sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of testosterone in these participants. Conclusions: Low levels of PAE were associated with disrupted cortisol activity, and males may be at higher risk. These findings challenge the existence of a "safe level" of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and have public health implications. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Objective: To assess the awareness and knowledge of pregnant Lebanese women about the risks of drinking during pregnancy and the factors that influence their drinking patterns. Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on a sample of 107 women consulting the gynecology outpatient department of Hotel-Dieu de France in Beirut, Lebanon, who completed the T-ACE screening test included in a 21 multiple choice questionnaire which examine knowledge and beliefs about alcohol use during pregnancy, drinking patterns and awareness of fetal alcohol exposure. Results: The 107 women of our sample were all married, between 20 and 41 years old and had mostly a high educational level (86%). Most of the women (47%) were at their first pregnancy. Of the 20 women who self-reported drinking during pregnancy, 60% obtained a positive score on the T-ACE questionnaire, which indicates that more than 11% of the women engaged with potentially high risk drinking for the baby. There is not a significant difference between the different age categories or educational levels. This proportion is lower than that found in international publications. However, the rate of excessive drinking (4 drinks or more on any one occasion in females) was higher and one woman in five reported excessive drinking in the previous year. There is a high level of knowledge that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the child, and the more consumption the more harmful and likely the effects, but there is confusion about the safety of small amounts of alcohol. Women (37%) think that there is a safe level of drinking during pregnancy; 29% tolerate up to one drink a month, 9% tolerate up to one drink a week and one woman thinks having one drink a day is safe. Women who actually drink during pregnancy are more likely to think that alcohol consumption to a certain level is safe. Women (31%) think that beer and/or wine are safe alcohols to a certain level during pregnancy. When asked about the source of this belief, 22% mention a gynecologist but the majority (61%) says it is a personal belief. Women (65%) in our sample are aware that alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to life-long disabilities in a child, such as delayed development (36%), birth defects/deformities (35%) and mental retardation (32%). However, up to 33% of the respondents report having no information about the effects of alcohol on the fetus and two women believe alcohol is not harmful at all. Women with lower levels of education are somewhat less knowledgeable about the risks of alcohol use during pregnancy than those with higher levels of education. There is no association between the drinking patterns of the women with their age, their professional habits and the alcohol consumption of their husbands. The women in our sample seem to be more aware of the necessity to stop smoking rather than stop drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Lebanese women are not fully aware of the recommendations and risks related to drinking during pregnancy. This is the reason why action must be taken to ensure better diffusion of these recommendations and better assessment of alcohol intake during prenatal visits. © L'Encephale, Paris, 2010.

N2  - Background: Although an extensive literature has documented a broad range of cognitive performance deficits in children with prenatal alcohol exposure, little is known about how the neurophysiological processes underlying these deficits may be affected. Event-related potentials (ERPs), which reflect task-specific changes in brain electrical activity, provide a method for examining multiple constituents of cognitive processing at the neural level.Methods: We recorded ERPs in 217 children from Inuit communities in Arctic Quebec (M age = 11.3 years) during 2 different tasks-Go/No-go response inhibition and continuous recognition memory. Children were classified as either alcohol-exposed (ALC) or controls (CON) depending on whether the mother reported binge drinking during pregnancy.Results: Both groups performed comparably in terms of accuracy and reaction time on the tasks, and both tasks elicited the expected effects on ERPs when responses were compared across conditions. However, the ALC group showed slower P2 latencies on Go/No-go, suggesting an altered neurophysiological response associated with initial visual processing of the stimuli. On the memory task, the ALC group showed reduced FN400 amplitude to New items, known as the familiarity effect, and reduced amplitude for the late positive component, possibly reflecting impairment in memory retrieval.Conclusions: These findings show that, even in tasks in which alcohol-exposed children exhibit behavioral performance that is comparable to controls, fetal alcohol exposure is associated with altered neurophysiological processing of response inhibition and recognition memory. The data suggest that fetal alcohol exposure is associated with reduced efficiency in the initial extracting of the meaning of a stimulus, reduced allocation of attention to the task, and poorer conscious, explicit recognition memory processing.

N2  - South Africa has the highest prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) in the world. The purpose of this study was to identify high risk factors associated with drinking alcohol prior to pregnancy recognition in 24 neighborhoods in the Cape Flats outside Cape Town, South Africa. An interviewer assessed risk among 619 pregnant Black/African women between the ages of 18 and 41 years. Logistic regression analyses explored factors associated with drinking alcohol post conception but prior to pregnancy recognition. Forced multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that drinking prior to pregnancy recognition was associated with being younger, single, having better living conditions, smoking, having a longer gestation prior to pregnancy recognition, having a greater number of sexual partners, and a higher incidence of intimate partner violence. Depressive symptoms tended to be higher among alcohol users. These risk factors were consistent with other research on the characteristics of South African women having children with a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and/or of non pregnant women at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. These findings highlight the need for women of child-bearing age to be routinely screened for alcohol use and its associated risk factors. Intervention efforts could be integrated into health initiatives already present in South Africa including the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malnutrition. Preconception care is particularly important since pregnancy recognition often occurs several weeks to months following conception and could be implemented by South African community health workers. These endeavors should facilitate national goals of healthier pregnancies and the elimination of FASDs in South Africa. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on memory and brain development was investigated in 92 African-American, young adults who were first identified in the prenatal period. Three groups (Control, n= 26; Alcohol-related Neurodevelopmental Disorder, n= 36; and Dysmorphic, n= 30) were imaged using structural MRI with brain volume calculated for multiple regions of interest. Memory was measured using the Verbal Selective Reminding Memory Test and its nonverbal counterpart, the Nonverbal Selective Reminding Memory Test, which each yielding measures of learning and recall. For both Verbal and Nonverbal Recall and Slope, linear trends were observed demonstrating a spectrum of deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Dysmorphic individuals performed significantly poorer than unexposed controls on 5 of 6 memory outcomes. Alcohol-exposed individuals demonstrated significantly lower total brain volume than controls, as well as lower volume in a number of specific regions including hippocampus. Mediation analyses indicated that memory performance associated with effects of prenatal alcohol exposure was mediated from dysmorphic severity through hippocampal volume, particularly right hippocampus. These results indicate that the association between the physical effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and deficits in memory are mediated by volumetric reduction in specific brain regions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - C57BL/6J (B6) mice are susceptible to in utero growth retardation and a number of morphological malformations following prenatal alcohol exposure, while DBA/2J (D2) mice are relatively resistant. We have previously shown that genomic imprinting may play a role in differential sensitivity between B6 and D2. The best-characterized mechanism mediating genomic imprinting is differential DNA methylation. In the present study we examined DNA methylation and gene expression, in both embryonic and placental tissue, at the mouse Igf2 locus following in utero ethanol exposure. We also examined the effects of a methyl-supplemented diet on methylation and ethanol teratogenesis. In embryos from susceptible B6 mice, we found small decreases in DNA methylation at four CpG sites in one of the differentially methylated regions of the Igf2 locus; only one of the four sites showed a statistically significant decrease. We observed no significant decreases in methylation in placentae. All Igf2 transcripts showed approximately 1.5-fold decreases following intrauterine alcohol exposure. Placing dams on a methyl-supplemented diet before pregnancy and throughout gestation brought methylation back up to control levels. Methyl supplementation also resulted in lower prenatal mortality, greater prenatal growth, and decreased digit malformations; it dramatically reduced vertebral malformations. Thus, although prenatal alcohol had only small effects on DNA methylation at the Igf2 locus, placing dams on a methyl-supplemented diet partially ameliorated ethanol teratogenesis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading cause of childhood neurodevelopmental disability. The adverse behavioral effects of alcohol exposure during the second and third trimester are well documented; less clear is whether early first trimester-equivalent exposures also alter behavior. We investigated this question using an established chick model of alcohol exposure. In ovo embryos experienced a single, acute ethanol exposure that spanned gastrulation through neuroectoderm induction and early brain patterning (19-22. h incubation). At 7 days posthatch, the chicks were evaluated for reflexive motor function (wingflap extension, righting reflex), fearfulness (tonic immobility [TI]), and fear/social reinstatement (open-field behavior). Chicks exposed to a peak ethanol level of 0.23-0.28% were compared against untreated and saline-treated controls. Birds receiving early ethanol exposure had a normal righting reflex and a significantly reduced wingflap extension in response to a sudden descent. The ethanol-treated chicks also displayed heightened fearfulness, reflected in increased frequency of TI, and they required significantly fewer trials for its induction. In an open-field test, ethanol treatment did not affect latency to move, steps taken, vocalizations, defecations, or escape attempts. The current findings demonstrate that early ethanol exposure can increase fearfulness and impair aspects of motor function. Importantly, the observed dysfunctions resulted from an acute ethanol exposure during the period when the major brain components are induced and patterned. The equivalent period in human development is 3-4 weeks postconception. The current findings emphasize that ethanol exposure during the early first trimester equivalent can produce neurodevelopmental disability in the offspring. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Our work and others' show that the teratogenic effects of alcohol can be modified by maternal genetic factors as well as genetic differences in fetal susceptibility and resistance. These genetic factors can interact with prenatal alcohol exposure-induced epigenetic changes in the offspring to result in the kaleidoscope of phenotypes that characterize fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We study this genotype X epigenotype interactions in a rat model of FASD that emulate many symptoms observed in children of alcohol-consuming mothers by focusing on epigenetic alterations of imprinted neurodevelopmental genes. One such gene is iodothyronine deiodinase III (Dio3), an imprinted gene that encodes the thyroid hormone inactivating enzyme and is highly expressed in the placenta and fetal brain. Our previous results indicate restricted thyroid hormone levels in the developing brain as a potential cause of neurodevelopmental deficits where epigenetic alterations of Dio3 expression could be directly responsible. To follow parent of origin allelic expression of Dio3 in the fetal and adult brain of the offspring of alcohol consuming and control dams we reciprocally crossed Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Brown Norway (BN) rats. In one of the reciprocal crosses, aberrant imprinting (altered allelic expression ratio and total expression) of Dio3 was found in the ethanol-exposed fetal frontal cortex with lasting consequences on thyroid hormone levels in this region in adults. Aberrant Dio3 imprinting was also found in the fetal and adult hippocampus of alcohol-exposed males. Hippocampal Dio3 enzyme levels, thyroid hormones, and social behaviors consistent with this state followed the same pattern in males only, suggesting a direct causal relationship between aberrant allelic expression of Dio3 and behavioral consequences. Importantly, all hippocampal effects were absent from females of the affected cross and from both males and females of the reciprocal cross. Thus genetic background and sex modify alcohol-induced alterations in the brain region-specific expression of Dio3 and thereby vulnerability to long-term behavioral deficits. This novel mechanism of vulnerability to prenatal alcohol that can be extended to other imprinted neurodevelopmental genes is one of the potential causes of the wide phenotypic heterogeneity in human FASD.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) constitute a significant health burden in South Africa. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has a prevalence of 60 to 70 per 1000 children of school going age in several communities in the Western and Northern Cape Provinces. FAS is characterized by developmental deficits, including growth and neurological development affecting cognitive ability and behavior, as well as causing distinct facial dysmorphology. The features of FAS and FASD have predominantly been attributed to gestational alcohol exposure with little knowledge about the effects of alcohol on gametogenesis during the preconception stage. The luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) was used to assess global DNA methylation of sperm DNA and bisulfite modification, followed by quantitative pyrosequencing, was used to assess the levels of methylation of selected CpG sites at paternally imprinted loci in sperm DNA and genomic DNA from offspring. The paternally imprinted H19 ICR which controls the reciprocal expression of H19 and IGF2, and the IGDMR controlling expression of DLK1 and GTL2 were investigated. There is significant global DNA hypomethylation of sperm DNA related to increased alcohol consumption (nondrinkers vs heavy drinkers [p = 0.018]; light drinkers vs heavy drinkers [p = 0.016]). A modest effect was observed at the H19 ICR and the IG-DMR loci correlated with alcohol consumption in humans, but no significant effect was observed at the H19 ICR in mouse sperm DNA following alcohol exposure. Interestingly, mice sired by alcohol exposed fathers had significantly reduced H19 ICR CpG methylation at the CTCF1 (p = 0.0017) and CTCF2 (p = 0.0007) binding sites. These studies confirm that paternal preconception alcohol exposure does affect global and locus specific CpG methylation and support an epigenetic mechanism for paternal alcohol related effects in their offspring.

N2  - Children of mothers who drank alcohol during pregnancy may suffer from a range of physical, neurological, and behavioral alterations. Using a rodent model, we have found that administration of choline, an essential nutrient that affects brain development, can mitigate many of the behavioral effects of developmental alcohol exposure. When administered at the same time as prenatal alcohol, choline reduces alcohol-related birth weight deficits and mitigates a variety of ethanol's effects on motor and cognitive development. However, even when administered postnatally (up to postnatal day (PD) 30), after alcohol exposure has ceased, choline supplementation reduces the severity of alcohol-induced deficits on a variety of learning tasks that depend on the functional integrity of the hippocampus, including spatial memory, working memory and trace conditioning of the eyeblink response. Choline plays many roles in brain development and function, acting as a precursor acetylcholine, membrane phospholipids, and as a methyl donor. Ethanol exposure (5.25 g/kg/day) via intubation during the third trimester equivalent brain growth spurt in Sprague-Dawley rats led to long-lasting reductions in hippocampal M1 muscarinic receptor density and increases in M2/4 muscarinic receptor density. Choline supplementation (100 mg/kg/day) from PD 4-30 did not affect M1 densities, but did significantly attenuated ethanol's effects on M2/4 muscarinic receptor density. These data indicate that choline acts, in part, by altering cholinergic functioning. In a separate experiment, rats were exposed to alcohol during the third trimester equivalent and treated with choline (100 mg/kg/day) from PD 2-20. Global DNA methylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was measured. Ethanol exposure altered DNA methylation, an effect that was attenuated with choline supplementation suggesting that choline mitigates ethanol's teratogenic effects, in part, via epigenetic mechanisms. Consistent with this finding, administration of betaine, a choline metabolite and methyl donor, also attenuates behavioral alterations associated with developmental alcohol exposure. These data suggest that choline may attenuate ethanol-related teratogenesis via several mechanisms. Elucidation of choline's mechanisms of action has important implications for the continuing identification of treatments for individuals with FASD.

N2  - It is frequently observed that fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is more easily recognized in young children. To explore how the face changes with age in those with and without histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, we analyzed over 200 Cape Coloured individuals evaluated at 2 time points, 4 years apart using 2 camera systems. We performed 3 comparisons at each age. First, we compared those with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure to controls. Then, we divided the alcohol-exposed children into two groups: those with facial dysmorphology who were classified as either FAS or partial FAS and those without dysmorphology but with heavy alcohol exposure. These nested comparisons allowed us to explore whether a unique set of variables could accurately identify those with heavy exposure who do not have the traditional physical markers of FAS. Data were analyzed using stepwise logistic regression analyses. There were few common variables that distinguished children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from controls at the two time points. At age 5, upper and lower facial depth, palpebral fissure length, minimal frontal width and nasal bridge length distinguished the 3 alcohol-exposed groups versus controls. No measure was a significant predictor in all comparisons of 5 year olds. At ages 5 and 9, when comparing alcohol exposed vs. controls, lower facial depth was a significant predictor. As expected at both ages, in alcohol-exposed children with traditional features of FAS, palpebral fissure length was smaller in the dysmorphic group than in the controls. In the comparison between controls and alcoholexposed children without traditional physical features of FAS, longer outer canthal length was associated with alcohol exposure at ages 5 and 9. At each age and in each comparison, inclusion of additional variables in the logistic regression model improved classification accuracy. Given the different models developed to predict group membership at ages 5 and 9, these data suggest that the rates of growth in the face vary during childhood development. The patterns of growth may mask some of the most characteristic features of FAS, making it more difficult to identify those who have been exposed prenatally. Interestingly, the classification rates were not dramatically different at the two ages. These data suggest that additional facial measures may be needed when assessing older children or adolescents for prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Alcohol use during human pregnancy is linked to congenital heart defects and to intrauterine growth retardation associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Objectives of our study were to determine: (i) effects of an acute, binge-drinking, ethanol (EtOH) dose during gastrulation on cardiac and placental development; and (ii) whether folate (FA) will reverse the deleterious effects of EtOH on embryogenesis by modulating WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Both avian and mouse models were analyzed. Exposure of embryos to EtOH during gastrulation induced cardiac and valve defects and embryonic growth restriction. Severity of anomalies related to timing of exposure. To initiate cardiogenesis in the embryo, the canonical Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) acts extracellularly to suppress WNT/beta-catenin signaling. This results in an up regulation of Hex (a marker of the primary heart field) and Islet-1 (a marker of the second heart field), two inducers of cardiogenesis. Exposure of gastrulating embryos to EtOH delayed Hex and Islet-1 gene expression within the cardiogenic crescent. This indicated an inhibition of Dkk1 antagonism and prolongation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling. An acute exposure of pregnant mice during gastrulation on E6.75 (morning of vaginal plug is E0.5) to an accepted binge-drinking dose of EtOH (two i.p. injections of 2.9g/kg of body weight, administered 3 hrs apart) induced cardiac valve defects in 87% of embryos and adverse changes in myocardial and placental blood flow, determined noninvasively on E15.5 by echocardiography. We had previously shown that FA supplementation overrides WNT/beta-catenin inhibition of cardiac gene induction in the heart fields. FA was tested for protective effects against EtOH exposure during cardiac specification. In the avian model, culture medium supplemented with both FA and EtOH resulted in normal Hex and Islet-1 expression and heart development. In the mouse, FA supplementation (10.5 mg/kg) provided in the chow beginning on E0.5 followed by exposure to EtOH on E6.75 showed 100% of embryos displaying normal cardiac function, valve development, and normal placental formation on E15.5, as assessed by echocardiography and by immunohistochemistry. We conclude that FA supplementation prevents the deleterious effects of alcohol by suppressing WNT/beta-catenin signaling by augmenting Wnt antagonism possibly by DNA methylation, thus allowing normal induction of gene expression and cardiomyocyte differentiation during development.

N2  - Prenatal ethanol exposures produce long-term suppression of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and its peptide products beta-endorphin, and alpha-MSH in the hypothalamus to produce abnormalities in neuroendocrine and immune functions. We have recently identified that the reduced POMC gene expression in the hypothalamus is associated with increased DNA methylation of the proximal POMC promoter, as well as elevated levels of methyl CpG binding protein (MeCP2) in beta-endorphin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus. In this study, we determined whether DNA hypermethylation is linked to the decreased POMC gene expression in the hypothalamus of fetal alcohol exposed rats, by measuring the changes in MeCP2 binding with promoter area of POMC gene. MeCP2 is a transcriptional regulator that binds to the methylated cytosines at CpG dinucleotides. Increased binding of MeCP2 to the proximal part of promoter is often associated with recruitment of gene silencing complex and subsequent down regulation of the gene expression in neurons. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to identify the location of MeCP2 binding sites on the POMC promoter in the arcuate area of rat hypothalamus. Regions with the highest MeCP2 binding corresponded to the sites with the strongest DNA methylation determined previously in our work. ChIP analysis of the chromatin isolated from the arcuate area of the offspring of alcohol-fed (AF), pair-fed (PF) and ad libitum-fed (AD) dams showed increased MeCP2 binding in proximal POMC promoter of AF as compared to AD and PF animals. These data provide support to the concept that DNA hypermethylation of POMC promoter caused by prenatal alcohol exposure leads to elevated MeCP2 binding on the POMC promoter and subsequent down regulation of POMC gene expression in the hypothalamus.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Despite alcohol's toxicity, it is widely used across the world and its effects on the premature newborn are still being explored. While newborns are already a vulnerable and high risk population, fetal alcohol exposure is thought to predispose the newborn to infections which can significantly impact morbidity. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that fetal ethanol (ETOH) exposure causes alveolar macrophage (AM) dysfunction in the developing lung but function was modulated by availability of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), nonoxidative metabolites of alcohol, are potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure and are linked to disruption of cellular functions. However, additional studies are needed to determine if these biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure contribute to alveolar macrophage dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the oleic acid form of FAEEs on the function of AM and to determine if GSH can modulate these effects Methods Used: The NR8383 cell line of rat AM was exposed to: control conditions, + 25 muM ethyl oleate, or + 50 muM ethyl oleate (60 min). After FAEE exposure, some cells were treated with GSH (500 muM) for 4 hrs. Using fluorescent microscopy, phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) was determined using MitoTracker Red CM-H2X Ros. mROS and phagocytosis was quantified as relative fluorescent units (RFU)/cell. Summary of Results: In these studies, FAEE exposure impaired the phagocytic function of AM and these affects were attenuated by the presence of GSH. There was a 10% decrease of mROS and 40% increase in phagocytosis in the cells treated with glutathione after exposure to oleic acid in comparison to cells exposed only to oleic acid. Conclusions: Acute exposure to FAEE (specifically ethyl oleate), increased AM mROS and impaired phagocytosis. Treatment with GSH attenuated these effects suggesting that FAEE exposure alone promoted oxidative stress. We hypothesize that FAEE due to prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to the dysfunction of developing AM and that these effects may be modulated by GSH.

N2  - We have observed that moderate drinking during pregnancy alters placental gene expression (Rosenberg et al., Alcohol. 44:673-90, 2010), suggesting that ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene expression might serve as a biomarker of fetal alcohol exposure. The present study addressed the question whether maternal drinking during pregnancy alters fetal cortical gene expression in a manner similar to the changes we have observed in placenta. Harlan Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed a mean of 2.72 g ethanol/kg during a fourhour period each day throughout pregnancy, a level that produces a mean peak serum ethanol level of 84 mg/dL. On gestational day 20, rat placental:fetal units were removed by Csection and whole placental and fetal cortical tissues rapidly dissected and frozen. RNA was extracted from both tissue types and processed for gene microarray analysis. Moderate drinking during pregnancy significantly altered the expression of 1041 genes in placenta and 1426 genes in cortex. Ethanol exposure repressed expression of the large majority of genes altered in both tissue types. However, only about 7% of the differentially expressed genes in placenta were also altered in cortex. In contrast to individual gene analyses, gene ontology analyses in both tissue types indicated that ethanol exposure significantly altered genes associated with the development and morphology in several tissue systems as well as immunologic responses. The top three categories that emerged from gene ontology analysis were cardiovascular as well as neural systems development and cell death. These results suggest that the analyses of placental gene ontology categories for specific organ systems may be informative of ethanol-induced alterations in fetal tissues. Given increasing evidence that cerebral microvascular development plays a critical role in neural development, our data suggest that investigating ethanol-induced perturbations in the placental vascular network may be a particularly fruitful target system for examining the utility of placenta as a biomarker tissue for fetal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol effects.

N2  - Introduction: An ongoing challenge for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is to expand recognizable facial features so that individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure who lack the classic facial phenotype can be identified, allowing for early interventions. This study aims to localize morphological changes related to prenatal alcohol exposure and determine if these can help predict exposure status. Methods: The sample included 68 healthy controls (HC), 68 heavy alcohol exposed (HE), and 23 children with partial FAS (PFAS), and 21 with FAS from the Cape Town Colored community (M age = 10.2; 89 males). 3D facial images were registered using landmarks defined by the anthropologists. The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on surface deformations and curvatures were examined using general linear models with age and gender as covariates. Group comparisons included HC vs. FAS (most extreme comparison), FAS+PFAS (expanding the FAS group to include PFAS), FAS+PFAS+HE (broadest comparison including children with a range of alcohol exposure), PFAS+HE (removing FAS, this comparison removes those with the most extreme facial dysmorphology), and HE (least extreme comparison). Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to predict alcohol exposure status. Results: The surface deformation from posterior to anterior in the HC group were detected significantly (corrected p < 0.05) larger than that in the FAS and FAS+PFAS groups in nasal bridge, nose, midface and jaw, and significantly taller than FAS+PFAS+HE in nose. The HC group also showed significantly longer and wider face than FAS, FAS+PFAS, and FAS+PFAS+HE. Although no significant curvature patterns were identified with corrected p < 0.05, maps of t statistics showed that the philtrum and mid-face regions in the HC group were more curved than those in the FAS and FAS+PFAS groups. The SVM prediction rates consistently dropped from the most extreme comparison to the least extreme one: 92.14% for HC vs FAS, 77.68% for HC vs FAS+PFAS, 61.67% for HC vs FAS+PFAS+HE, 57.23% for HC vs PFAS+HE, and 55.15% for HC vs HE. Conclusion: These results validate our hypothesis that fetal alcohol exposure had significant impact on facial dysmorphology, detected in the areas of nose, nasal bridge, mid-face, philtrum, and jaw, and facial width and length. Further studies will help find the relations between the facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and classic FAS facial phenotypes.

N2  - Facial anthropometry coupled with logistical regression has been shown to provide a sensitive complement for identifying FASD (fetal alcohol spectrum disorder). Facial anthropometry is inherently affected by the amount of facial adipose tissue that would limit its robustness. This study was designed to investigate the underlying craniofacial bone in a C57BL/6J mouse model. The objective is to identify specific craniofacial bone dysmorphology as a function of age and exposure and to establish their correlation to human anthropometry analogues. Three treated groups, ALC-ALC (pre- and pregnancy alcohol with 4.8 % (v/v) alcohol liquid), ALC-PF (pre alcohol and a calorically matched liquid pregnancy diet), and CHOW (ad lib chow/water), were examined. The pregnancy exposure lasted from embryonic day (E) 7- E16. All delivered pups were culled to 6/litter and surrogate fostered. On postnatal days (P)7 and 21, craniofacial bones were imaged using 3D microCT, and 12 craniofacial bone measurements were defined as mouse equivalents of a subset used in human studies. Data was examined by ANOVA and Logistic Regression to discern features that predict alcohol exposure with high accuracy. Longitudinal changes were tracked within each group. At P7, seven differences were observed for ALC-ALC and five for ALC-PF compared to Chow pups. Two widths (minimal frontal and inner canthal) together with one depth (middle facial) resulted in 83% (sensitivity) classification of ALC-ALC mice vs. 86% (specificity) of the PF. At P21, the differences between ALC-PF and CHOW groups diminished and lead to very low classification sensitivity (48%). ALC-ALC group maintained seven measurement differences from both CHOW and ALC-PF controls. But a lower sensitivity (75%) was observed among ALC-ALC and Chow with measures including inner canthal, inner orbital width and nasal length. The longitudinal comparison showed less growth of CHOW (minimal frontal and inner canthal width). These results suggest that dietary and alcohol effects contribute to craniofacial dysmorphology, where smaller measurements for both ALC-ALC and ALC-PF pups are seen at P7 and excellerated growth of ALC-PF at P21. There is evidence that alcohol induced dysmorphology changes with age in part due to increased relative growth of exposed individuals. This information could be important to assist in clinical variants of human FASD patients.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol abuse causes important structural and functional brain defects and is estimated to negatively impact up to 1% of pregnancies in the United States. Unfortunately, extensive efforts to promote alcohol abstinence during pregnancy have failed to reduce the incidence. A number of promising interventional strategies have been devised; however, successful implementation likely will require early identification of affected individuals. Currently, there is no effective means of identifying affected children during the perinatal period. We hypothesize that fetal ultrasonographic measurements, individually or collectively, can predict prenatal alcohol exposure. A human clinical pilot study (PMID:19444822) has established the potential for fetal ultrasonography to provide a method for prenatal identification of affected children. However, that study depended upon self-reporting of alcohol ingestion to establish exposure and is preliminary. Ultrasonography, unlike other imaging technologies like MRI, is already routinely employed during pregnancy. Additional ultrasound advantages over MRI are that examinations are less expensive, faster and not subject to motion artifact. A collection of 12 measurements of the skull, eyes, brain and legs were obtained from 76-day gestation sheep utilizing transabdominal ultrasonography. Subjects received either saline, 1.75 or 2.5 g/kg alcohol IV on three consecutive days per week from gestation day 4-41. Intraorbital and frontothalamic distances were significantly greater in the high alcohol group compared to the low alcohol and saline groups (n = 10, 13 and 14 respectively. We conclude that further efforts to develop a set of prenatal ultrasonographic measurements for FASD screening are warranted. Supported by NIAAA Grant AA0171290 (TAC).

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is diagnosed by the presence of growth retardation, central nervous system damage, and a distinct pattern of facial dysmorphology. FAS reflects the severe end of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), but the prevalence of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in FASD cases without facial dysmorphology may be 10 fold higher than FAS. Diagnosis of nondysmorphic FASD cases is very difficult, limiting opportunities for treatment and intervention. The current study used a mouse model to test whether variations in development of facial features induced by prenatal alcohol exposure are detectable using quantitative morphometric methods, and whether the duration of alcohol exposure is a contributing factor to variable dysmorphology. Female C56BL/6J mice were divided into four groups. Chow group was given ad libitum chow and water throughout the experimental period. The alcohol groups and the pair-fed (PF) group were given a liquid diet with 4.8% alcohol for 2 weeks prior to mating. During pregnancy, the ALC groups were given the alcohol diet either on embryonic days 7 (E7)-E11 or E7-E16. The PF dams were given equal volumes of an isocaloric diet on E7-E16. All embryos were analyzed at E17. Analyses included 15 facial measurements (derived as analogues of human anthropometry measures from a previous FAS study), along with measures of crown-rump lengths, weights, ocular abnormalities, head circumference, and limb development. The 4.8% alcohol liquid diet from E7-E16 caused distinct facial dysmorphology including altered whisker pad, upper facial depth, midfacial depth, and lower facial height (all p < 0.002). Two measures, upper facial depth and midfacial depth, were identified as predictors for alcohol treatments that could classify the E7-E16 alcohol group from nonexposed PF and Chow controls in a discriminant analysis, with overall correct classification 79%. However, in E7-E11 group, only upper facial depth, and minimal frontal height (both p < 0.01) were different between ALC and Controls. Alcohol significantly reduced crown-rump length, head circumference, and embryo weight in E7-E16 group, but only crown-rump length in E7-E11 group. The duration of alcohol exposure is an important factor contributing to severity of facial dysmophology and growth retardation. The E7-E11 alcohol exposure showed considerably reduced dysmorphology compared to E7-E16 alcohol exposure.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to a wide range of physical and neurobehavioral anomalies. Despite ongoing health warnings, pregnant women continue to consume alcohol, making it imperative to elucidate protective factors and develop effective interventions that ameliorate alcohol's teratogenicity. Choline is an essential nutrient that influences brain and behavior development, and pre- and postnatal supplementation has been shown to reduce some fetal alcohol effects. However, it is not clear whether alcohol influences choline metabolism during pregnancy and/or whether choline supplementation compensates for an alcohol-related nutritional deficiency. Blood samples were collected from 217 pregnant women in two regions of Ukraine, 114 of whom reported moderate to heavy prenatal alcohol exposure in the month around conception and/or in the most recent month of pregnancy and 103 of whom reported little or no alcohol in either time frame. There was no effect of alcohol on plasma choline, betaine, or dimethylglycine. In a parallel study, pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams were intubated with 6.0 g/kg/day ethanol from gestational days (GD) 5-20; yoked pairfed and ad libitum chow controls were included. Levels of choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine were measured in the blood of dams at GD 10 and 15 and in the plasma of dams and fetuses at GD 21. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not decrease plasma choline levels in either mother or fetus. However, there were age-dependent effects of alcohol on plasma betaine levels and a transient decrease in plasma dimethylglycine (both involved in the methionine-homocysteine cycle) in alcohol-exposed dams during the period of intoxication. These data suggest that alcohol does not induce a choline deficiency, but may transiently interfere with choline-related pathways, which could contribute to alcohol's damaging effects on the fetus. Alcohol-related changes in choline metabolism may not be evident in clinical populations if blood is collected outside periods of intoxication. These data have important implications for the elucidation of mechanisms by which alcohol disrupts development and may lead to a better understanding of how alcohol-nutrition interactions may influence alcohol's teratogenic effects.

N2  - Glutamine is a component of proteins, an intermediate and regulator in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, precursor for glutamate, nucleotides, aminosugars and glutathione synthesis and apoptosis suppressor. Because of glutamine's many important roles and the rapid depletion of whole body glutamine during illness and trauma, glutamine has been studied extensively as a nutrient supplement. Since glutamine supplementation reduces whole-body proteolysis and increases protein accretion in low birth weight infants and because glutamine plays key roles in the above mentioned processes that are disrupted by alcohol, we hypothesize that an acute administration of glutamine may have a protective effect on prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant ewes were assigned to five groups: saline control, glutamine control, alcohol, alcohol+glutamine at 30 mg/kg, and alcohol+glutamine at 100 mg/kg. Alcohol (1.75 mg/kg) or saline infusions were given IV over an hour with glutamine administered as an IV bolus at the beginning of the experiment. Concentrations of amino acids in plasma were markedly reduced in the fetus and mother in response to alcohol, except for glutamate, which increased substantially in the mother and modestly in the fetus. In the alcohol+glutamine groups, there was also a decrease in both maternal and fetal plasma concentrations of multiple amino acids. While the patterns of change in amino acids in the groups receiving glutamine have similarities to the alcohol group, different mechanisms and processes are occurring when glutamine is present. This is Supported by the observation of reductions in plasma amino acid concentrations in the glutamine control group. Glutamine is known to have trophic, anabolic effects and there is evidence that glutamine may both stimulate protein synthesis and inhibit protein degradation. Thus the net effect of glutamine administration could result in a decrease in plasma amino acids from anabolic stimulation. Results of this study support the conclusion that alcohol alters amino acid homeostasis in both the mother and the fetus. These findings may help explain the intrauterine growth retardation and structural damage to the nervous system observed in FASD. Glutamine has great potential as a new nutritional means to ameliorate alcohol-induced metabolic disorders and thus serve as an intervention or therapeutic strategy for FASD.

N2  - Prenatal choline supplementation has been shown to mitigate neurodevelopmental damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in rats suggesting its potential as an intervention for FASD. The recommended human choline intake during pregnancy is 450 mg/day and 3500 mg/day is the tolerable upper limit or roughly a dose of 60 mg in a 60 kg woman. Studies in rodents have exceeded this range, with no apparent side effects at 200 mg/kg in mice and 250 mg/kg in pregnant rats. However, in baboons, choline supplementation at a dose roughly equivalent to 20 mg/kg together with alcohol resulted in hepatotoxicity likely due to lower choline oxidase activity in this species. Sheep, like primates, also have lower choline oxidase activity compared to rodents, and therefore likely have a lower tolerable upper intake level of choline than rats. Therefore, we believe the ovine model is appropriate for investigating the safety and efficacy of choline supplementation. Three groups, normal control, low choline (10 mg/kg), high choline (3500 mg/kg) received vehicle or microencapsulated choline (Reashure, Balchem) once daily for 30 days at which time animals were sacrificed and the livers were perfused with formalin. Tissues were paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Three veterinary pathologists blinded to treatment group independently scored the sections for presence, severity and distribution of the following parameters: hydropic degeneration, necrosis, megalocytosis, vacuolar degeneration, regeneration, hepatic and capsular fibrosis, inflammation and cell type. No pathological changes were identified that could be attributed to choline toxicity. Though these findings support the safety of choline supplementation in sheep at doses like those recommended in humans, subjects were not pregnant, did not receive choline for a duration as long as a whole pregnancy and did not receive concurrent alcohol. Studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of choline supplementation in sheep during pregnancy and with concurrent alcohol exposure are now underway. Supported by NIAAA Grant AA0171290 (TAC). All or part of this work was done in conjunction with the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), which is funded by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA).

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), but wide phenotypic variations in facial, brain, and neurobehavioral abnormalities are evident. Factors contributing to this phenotypic variation have been identified suing rodent models of alcohol exposure using various delivery methods including oral gavage, liquid diets, injections, vapor inhalation, and free choice drinking. Comparisons between inbred strains of mice have implicated genetic differences as an important risk factor, but strain differences in pharmacokinetics, alcohol preference, stress responses, nutritional status, and difficulties in matching blood alcohol levels, have made it difficult to determine genetic contributions to FASD. This study examined alcohol delivery to pregnant mouse dams of two different inbred strains, one known to be vulnerable to prenatal alcohol-induced teratogenesis (C57BL/6J; [B6]) and the other known to be resistant (129S6/SvEv/Tec; [S129]), using an ethanol vapor chamber inhalation system. Careful regulation of this system provides a means to control alcohol exposure and match the blood alcohol levels produced in the two strains, regardless of any strain differences in pharmacokinetics. Exposure of pregnant dams of each strain to alcohol vapor was limited to 4 or 6 hrs, beginning on embryonic day 8.25, followed by air alone for 44 or 42 hr additional growth. Control groups were exposed to air alone. Embryos were then collected on E10 and assessed for teratogenesis and growth retardation using van Maele-Fabry scoring. By fine tuning vapor concentration settings, the settings were able to consistently target blood alcohol profiles with peak levels of 200, 300, or 400 mg/dl over the testing period established for both strains. The B6 embryos showed alcohol-induced growth retardation for somite number, caudal neural tube, branchial processes, and optic system at 300 mg/dl. At 400 mg/dl additional heart, maxillary process, and fore-, mid- and hindbrain developmental delays were evident. A concentration-dependent decreased in embryo survival and litter size was also found for B6 dams. The 129S strain showed limited delay forelimb formation at 300 mg/dl. Further study in higher dose is in progress. These findings using in vivo exposure at comparable blood alcohol levels are consistent with our previous studies embryo culture methods.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can be harmful to the fetus. Not all women who consume alcohol during pregnancy give birth to children with observable deficits, which demonstrates individual differences in susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis. Genetic factors, among others, can mediate differential sensitivity. C57BL/6J (B6) mice are susceptible to fetal weight deficits and morphological malformations following prenatal ethanol exposure, while DBA/2J (D2) mice are resistant. We performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for ethanol teratogenesis in BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice, derived from a cross between B6 and D2. On gestational day 9 (GD 9), pregnant dams were gavaged with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin. On GD 18, dams were sacrificed, fetuses excised and prepared for teratological examinations. Heritability was calculated and QTL mapping performed for prenatal mortality, fetal and placental weight, and digit (fused and missing), kidney (dilated), brain ventricle (dilated), rib (fused, bifurcated, wavy) and vertebral (fused, missing, asymmetrical arches and centra) malformations. Heritabilities were modest and ranged from 0.10 for placental weight to 0.35 for rib malformations. QTL mapping was performed using WebQTL and identified suggestive and/or significant QTLs for all phenotypes. Based upon gene function and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in B6 and D2, several candidate genes emerged. A QTL region influencing digit malformations on chromosome 16 contains the gene Adamts1, which codes for a metallopeptidase. Adamts1 plays a critical role in interdigital web regression during development; it is polymorphic for 35 of 41 SNPs in B6 and D2. A significant QTL region mediating rib malformations on chromosome 7 contained the Wnt-family gene Wnt11, which is known to play a role in somite and rib development. Wnt11 is polymorphic for 108 of 134 SNPs in B6 and D2. Alx4 is a homeobox gene that plays a role in somite and vertebral development and is in a QTL region on chromosome 2; it is polymorphic for 108 of 245 SNPs in B6 and D2. Neph1 is a candidate gene for kidney malformations; it plays a role in kidney development and is polymorphic for 237 of 459 SNPs in B6 and D2. Gene expression analysis and functional testing of these and other candidate genes will clarify their role in susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of ethanol.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can have detrimental effects on the developing fetus, resulting in a constellation of developmental, behavioral and CNS deficits known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Many variables play a role in susceptibility to FASD, including genetics. Work from our lab and others has shown that C57BL/6J (B6) mice are susceptible to ethanolinduced teratogenesis, while DBA/2J (D2) mice are relatively resistant. We have demonstrated that maternal genotype also plays an important role in susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of ethanol. In this study, we further elucidate the genetic pathways mediating susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis by examining global changes in gene expression in embryonic and placental-decidual tissue derived from B6 and D2 mice. Methods: We generated both homozygous (B6B6 and D2D2) and reciprocal heterozygous (B6D2 and D2B6) offspring genotypes. On gestational day 9, females were given 5.8 g/kg ethanol (20% w:v) or maltose-dextrin by oral gavage; a nonintubated control group was also included. 4 hrs later, tissue was harvested and subsequently processed for microarray analysis. Five litters were used for each combination of treatment, tissue type and strain, for a total of 120 arrays. For the analysis, we removed probe sets that contained SNPs that differed across strains. Data were then normalized, log transformed and filtered by 'absent' and 'present' status for a final set of 13,558 probe sets that were used for ANOVA and Gene Ontology analysis. Results: We report on genes with significant main effects of strain, ethanol, tissue and/or strain by ethanol interactions. In general, we found that strain type explained the most variability in expression. For the probe sets significantly different in the homozygous strains, we found enrichment in metabolic and development related genes. Ethanol treatment affected the expression of mRNA processing and metabolism genes. Expression of development related genes significantly differed among tissues. Most surprisingly, for the ethanol by strain interaction, we found that the majority of differentially regulated genes were specifically affected in the B6B6, followed by the B6D2 strains. Conclusion: We have discovered gene expression differences mediated by both genetic and maternal effects that potentially modulate susceptibility to ethanol-induced teratogenesis.

N2  - Once an intervention has evidence of efficacy, it is important to determine the mechanisms of action of that intervention to inform clinician training and dissemination efforts. Studies from our group have shown that a Motivational Interviewing (MI) based intervention, Project CHOICES, is efficacious in reducing the risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) among high-risk women by reducing problem drinking and/or increasing effective contraception (Floyd et al., 2007; Velasquez et al., 2010). While the evidence base shows that the CHOICES intervention is effective in reducing AEP risk, little is known about how it works. In a NIHSupported study, (NIH R01 AA015930) we have coded therapist behaviors to explicate treatment session characteristics in relation to outcomes from the Project CHOICES Trial. The original CHOICES efficacy trial included 830 women at risk for AEP across 6 settings. The intervention targeted two behaviors: drinking and contraception use, and included four individual MI-based sessions and a contraceptive visit. Intervention women had better odds of reduced AEP risk at 9 months (OR=2.11). A Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was conducted on the session 2 tapes (n = 113). Session 2 was selected for the analysis because the session protocol contained the heaviest concentration of the CHOICES activities. The indicators for latent classes in the LPA included: CHOICES protocol rating; MI-consistent therapist behaviors (advise with permission, affirm, emphasize control, open questions, reflect, reframe, and support); MI spirit; and therapeutic alliance, as well as AEP risk status at 3 and 9 months. Comparison of one, two, three, and four latent class models favored a two class solution (BIC = 1616.934; Entropy = 0.662; Mean probability of membership for the two classes were 0.81 and 0.92 respectively). The two classes were significantly different with one class having higher ratings on the CHOICES protocol, MI spirit and therapeutic alliance constructs. The class with the higher ratings also had much lower probability of being at-risk for AEP at 3 months (23% vs. 62%) and at 9 months (17.0% vs. 49%). We found no difference in MIconsistent behaviors between classes. Results suggest that dissemination efforts should concentrate on the CHOICES protocol and how MI is delivered (spirit) and not just on training the technical aspects of MI. Teaching how to deliver the intervention may best be accomplished with coaching beyond an initial intensive training.

N2  - The hippocampus is a site of adult neurogenesis believed to contribute to learning and memory. Previous work in our lab has shown that exposure to moderate levels of alcohol throughout gestation results in a diminished neurogenic response to environmental enrichment within the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (Choi et al., 2005). The goal of the current research is to determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure impairs the ability of newlygenerated adult dentate granule cells (DGCs) to incorporate into spatial memory networks. For these studies, we utilized Nestin-CreERT2:YFP bitransgenic mice in which tamoxifen exposure induces YFP reporter gene expression in nestin+ neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and all subsequent progeny. Mice received tamoxifen injections at a dose of 180 mg/kg/day, i.p., for five consecutive days, and were subsequently trained on hippocampaldependent tasks 6 to 8 weeks following the final injection. Mice were either trained on the 2- way separation radial arm maze using 2 training sessions per day for 2 days, followed by 3 days of memory recall testing; or the mice were exposed to a 7 trial trace fear conditioning paradigm and tested for memory recall 24 hours later to context and tone. Ninety minutes following the recall tests, mice were sacrificed and evaluated for the expression of c-Fos and YFP reporter colocalization. Preliminary data indicate that approximately 3% of YFP labeled adult-born DGCs express c-Fos during recall in the radial arm maze paradigm, as compared to 0% in behavioral test control mice. Quantification of c-Fos/YFP colocalization following trace conditioning is currently underway. Once optimized, these paradigms will be used to determine the impact of prenatal alcohol on functional incorporation of YFP+ DGCs.

N2  - We hypothesized that some of the deleterious effects of ethanol on the developing brain may be due to the disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in brain cells as cholesterol deficiencies cause brain anomalies associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities similar to the ones reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. We have previously shown that ethanol induces cholesterol efflux in astrocytes, but not in neurons, through the upregulation of the cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Astrocytes also secrete lipoproteins; as ABCA1 and ABCG1 are involved in the biogenesis and maturation of lipoproteins, which are cholesterol acceptors and extract cholesterol from both neurons and astrocytes, we hypothesized that ethanol may upregulate lipoprotein production in astrocytes and, through this mechanism, increase cholesterol efflux from astrocytes and neurons. Using fast liquid lipoprotein chromatography (FPLC) with a size exclusion column, we separated astrocytegenerated lipoproteins (A-Lps) from astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM). The levels of phospholipids, cholesterol and apolipoprotein E (Apo E), the three main components of A-Lps, were quantified in 71 fractions eluted from FPLC by ELISA (ApoE) and enzymatic assays (phospholipids and cholesterol). We found that after 48 h ethanol treatments, the levels of phospholipids, cholesterol and ApoE were significantly increased in elution fractions 16-36, suggesting a significant increase in the production and release of A-Lps. In addition, we found that while the ACM containing normal A-Lps were able to induce cholesterol efflux from naive neurons and astrocytes, the ACM from ethanol treated astrocytes, containing more A-Lps, further increased cholesterol efflux from both cell types. To explore the consequences of the exposure of neurons to cholesterol acceptors we incubated neurons with High Density Lipoproteins (HDL) for different lengths of time; 3- and 5-day incubations with HDL resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular cholesterol and neuronal survival in cortical primary neurons. Based on these results, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure may cause neuronal cell death by increasing the release of lipoproteins from astrocytes leading to increased cholesterol efflux and reduced cholesterol content in neurons.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure results in persistent changes in gene expression in the brain that are pertinent to neuroendocrine and neuroimmune function, and whether these changes in expression arise from epigenetic changes. We utilize a model of prenatal alcohol exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats. Ethanol is administered to pregnant dams throughout gestation in a liquid diet fed ad libitum (36% calories derived from ethanol). Maltose-dextrin is isocalorically substituted for ethanol in a liquid control diet for the Pair-fed group, and a control group receives lab chow ad libitum. We examine the development and resolution of an inflammatory response by subjecting animals to an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) paradigm. At postnatal day 50-55, female offspring were injected with either complete Freund's adjuvant or saline. AA suppressed weight gain and induced a persistent inflammation of the paws. Ethanol-exposed females demonstrated increased severity and a more prolonged course of AA. Whole genome gene expression analysis was then performed for the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus using Illumina microarray technology for samples across prenatal treatment, injection condition and time (peak of AA, day 16 postinjection, and resolution, day 39 postinjection). Differential expression and gene network analysis is currently being conducted to evaluate whether the differences among groups in clinical response to AA are attributable to underlying differences in regulation of neuroendocrine and neuroimmune gene networks. Preliminary epigenetic analyses will examine promoter methylation of differentially expressed genes.

N2  - Ethanol-induced neurodevelopmental abnormalities are associated with impaired insulin/IGF signaling, and increased oxidative stress in CNS neurons. We examined the roles of ethanol and its principal toxic metabolite, acetaldehyde, as mediators of impaired insulin/IGF signaling and oxidative injury in immature neuronal cells. Primary rat cerebellar granule neuron and human cerebellar neuronal cell line cultures were exposed to 3.5 mM acetaldehyde or 50 mM ethanol +/- 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), an inhibitor of ethanol metabolism for 24 or 48 h. The cultures were used to measure viability, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and insulin responsiveness. Live cells were used to measure mitochondrial function, ATP content, and viability. Gene expression was measured by qRT-PCR analysis and cellular ELISAs. Acetaldehyde treatment significantly increased neuronal death, and 4-HNE and 8- OHdG immunoreactivities, and it reduced mitochondrial function, including ATP levels, but it did not impair insulin responsiveness, including insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK MAPK or Akt. Ethanol exposure produced similar effects, but it also impaired insulin responsiveness characterized by reduced insulin stimulated levels of phospho-Erk MAPK, phospho-Akt, and insulin- or IGF-1-responsive genes, e.g. GAPDH, aspartyl-(asparaginyl)-bhydroxylase, and choline acetyltransferase. 4-MP abated the ethanol-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, but failed to restore insulin responsiveness and insulinstimulated gene expression. Furthermore, following chronic prenatal ethanol exposure, expression of several alcohol and aldehyde metabolizing enzymes, including ADH 1, 2, 5, and ALDH1-3, was significantly reduced in brain; in vitro studies showed that acetaldehyde and not ethanol+4MP mediated these effects. Together, these results suggest that brain insulin resistance resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure is caused by direct effects of ethanol, while oxidative neuronal injury and DNA damage are caused by ethanol and its toxic metabolites. In addition, the neurodevelopmental abnormalities caused by chronic prenatal exposure to ethanol may be exacerbated by down-regulation of genes that promote ethanol's metabolism and detoxification in the CNS. Accumulation of ethanol's toxic metabolites may activate a vicious feedback loop causing further DNA damage and neuronal death due to inhibition of enzymes required for complete ethanol metabolism.

N2  - Evidence converging from clinical and preclinical studies of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) shows that motor deficits are associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Children exposed to alcohol in utero display impairments of manual dexterity, strength of grip, and postural balance. However, little is known about motor sequencing in this population. Given that motor sequencing is critically important for performance of skilled tasks such as typing and writing, the present study investigated the neural aspects of this function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve right-handed children with FASD, ages 12 to 18, and 11 age- and gender matched controls participated. The participants completed a test battery including a motor sequencing task, in which they performed simple and complex finger sequences using the dominant or the nondominant hand. The motor sequences were administered using a procedure described by Haaland et al. (2004). In this procedure, a simple sequence involved making key presses 5 times with the index (1), middle (2), or ring (3) finger (e.g. 1,1,1,1,1; 2,2,2,2,2). A complex sequence involved performance of 5 key presses with the 3 fingers in a mixed order (1,3,2,1,2; 3,1,2,3,1 etc.). Whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to record BOLD signals during performance of the motor sequencing task. Analyses of the behavioral data showed that the two groups differed in performances of complex, but not simple, sequences. The FASD group took longer and made more errors than the control group on the complex sequences. The fMRI data revealed that the FASD group showed greater BOLD signal changes than the control group during performance of the simple sequences, despite the lack of group differences on behavioral measures. For example, when performing the simple sequences with the right hand, the FASD group showed greater task-related BOLD signal changes in the left inferiortemporal, right orbitofrontal, and left occipital cortices, as well as in a region along the calcarine fissure. In contrast, the control group displayed greater bold signal changes in bilateral occipital, bilateral temporal, bilateral frontal regions as well as in the cerebellum and the basal ganglia during performance of the complex sequences. This pattern is consistent with the finding that children with FASD display difficulty with complex tasks that involve cognitive control.

N2  - The underlying physiological abnormalities associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in children are poorly understood. Identifying both basic sensory and cognitive deficits in young children with FASD is important to facilitate a broader understanding of the deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure; as is identifying potential markers for early diagnosis of FASD in young children. We recruited children aged 3 to 6 years [9 FASD and 18 age-matched healthy controls (HC)] to participate in a study to characterize auditory and somatosensory integration using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Bilateral tones and air puff tactile stimulation to bilateral index fingers were presented both individually and synchronously to the children as they viewed a silent movie while resting with their head in the MEG machine. Movement compensation software was used to account for head position movement throughout the data collection period. Trials with movements or other artifacts were rejected and the remaining trials were signal averaged. MRIs of the children were used to register the cortical sources identified with MEG to the structural anatomy. The time courses of the primary auditory sources were compared between the FASD and the HC children. In the auditory alone condition, there was a trend for a delayed response in the FASD. Preliminary results also showed a delayed auditory response in the primary auditory cortex in the FASD group during the synchronous auditory/somatosensory condition. The peak latency of the right hemisphere auditory M100 response was significantly (t = 2.0; p = 0.04) delayed in the children with FASD (150 ms) relative to the healthy control children (122 ms). These results suggest possible auditory processing deficits in children with FASD relative to healthy control children, which are amplified in the synchronous auditory/somatosensory condition. Basic sensory processing deficits and deficits in cortical integration including multisensory processing may play a role in improper development of higher cognitive functions. Further research exploring the relationship between sensory and cognitive deficits is needed to better understand the effect of auditory deficits on outcome in these young children.

N2  - Recent findings suggest that the negative impact of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) may be mitigated by micronutrient supplements. The impact of providing micronutrient supplements, including choline, during pregnancy on the effects of PAE on neurodevelopmental outcome, specifically cardiac orienting responses (ORs) to stimuli, of 6-month old Ukrainian infants was studied. Methods. Alcohol-using women and a comparison sample were recruited in Rivne, Ukraine during their pregnancy and randomized to a micronutrient supplement group: None, Multivitamin/Minerals Only (M/M), and Multivitamin/Minerals plus Choline (M/M + Choline). Supplements were provided and their use monitored via blood levels. Infants (n = 94) returned for 6-mo developmental testing, including ORs to visual and auditory habituation/dishabituation paradigms. Responses to the habituation stimulus (10 trials) reflect encoding and sustained attentional focus and responses to the dishabituation stimulus (5 trials) require the additional use of memory skills. Results. For auditory habituation ORs, those in the PAE-M/M + Choline group showed a greater magnitude of HR deceleration relative to those with PAE receiving no treatment or M/ M on trials 2 and 3 (F (4, 160) = 2.58, p < 0.04). For the auditory dishabituation ORs, a significant intervention group effect was found (F (2,71)=3.69, p < 0.03) with the greatest magnitude of deceleration in the M/M + Choline group. A trend was also found for those in the exposed group having lower magnitude of ORs (F (1, 71)=2.384, p < 0.127). On the visual habituation trials, only a significant trial*intervention group effect was found (F (4,156) = 2.352, p < 0.056). Post hoc comparisons indicated that on trial 1, those in the M/ M + Choline group had greater magnitude of ORs than did those who received no micronutrients and on trial 2, the M/M + Choline group had greater magnitude ORs than did both other intervention groups. Finally, on trial 3, the M/M group had lower magnitude of ORs than did the group who received no micronutrients. On the visual dishabituation trials, a trend for an exposure group by trial interaction was also found (F (2,128)=2.685, p < 0.072) with those in the alcohol exposed group demonstrating diminished ORs on trial 3. Conclusion. Preliminary analysis suggests that the negative impact of PAE on neurophysiological responses to environmental stimuli may be, at least partially, ameliorated by the use micronutrients prenatally.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Children with history of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure often meet criteria for attention-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent research has focused on comparisons with unexposed children with ADHD to determine if there are differences in symptomology due to etiology. Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT), defined by symptoms such as underactivity and daydreaming, occurs in a subgroup of children with ADHD and is associated with increased internalizing behaviors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether similar findings are seen in alcohol-exposed children. Methods: As part of a multisite study, primary caregivers of 148 children (8-18y, M=12.22y), completed the SCT scale, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC). Subjects consisted of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (n = 53), nonexposed children with ADHD (n = 38), and typically developing controls (n = 57). The exposed group included children with (n = 35) and without (n = 18) ADHD. Therefore, SCT scores were analyzed by a 2 (alcohol-exposed vs. nonexposed) x 2 (ADHD vs. non-ADHD) ANOVA. The relation between SCT and CBCL behavior scores was measured with Pearson correlations. Results: Analyses revealed a significant Exposure x ADHD interaction on SCT as well as main effects for both factors (exposed>nonexposed, ADHD>non-ADHD). Post hoc tests showed that in children with ADHD, alcohol exposure did not have an additive effect on SCT scores; children with ADHD had higher scores, regardless of exposure history. In children without ADHD, alcohol exposure had a significant effect (exposed>nonexposed). SCT was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with CBCL Internalizing and Externalizing scores. Conclusion: Overall, children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were characterized by elevated SCT although the elevation was significantly smaller in the exposed children without comorbid ADHD. This suggests that even in the absence of ADHD, prenatal alcohol exposure influences a sluggish cognitive tempo. SCT scores were related to internalizing behaviors, which is consistent with previous research in ADHD. However, SCT was also related to externalizing behaviors in this sample suggesting a lack of specificity. Additional study with a larger sample may provide further insight into this symptom cluster in alcohol-exposed children.

N2  - Purpose of the Study: Developmental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure may be potentiated by environmental factors, such as suboptimal nutrition more common in emerging democracies. This study examines effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on 6-month infant outcome in Ukraine and evaluates potential for ameliorating such effects with micronutrient supplements, including choline, taken in pregnancy. Methods: At two Ukrainian Omni-Net sites, Khmelnitsky and Rivne, alcohol-using women and nondrinking or light-drinking controls were recruited midtrimester and randomized to one of three micronutrient supplement groups, None, Multivitamin/Minerals Only, and Multivitamin/ Minerals plus Choline. Supplements were provided by the research study and use monitored via blood levels. When children were 6 months old, 93 families returned for development testing using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second Edition. This standardized test assesses cognitive (Mental Development Index: MDI) and motor (Psychomotor Development Index: PDI) development. Results: A 2-factor multivariate analysis of variance was done with MDI and PDI as dependent variables. Alcohol use (2 levels: None, Alcohol) and Multivitamin/Mineral supplementation (2 Levels: None, Multivitamins/Minerals) were independent variables. The analysis collapsed over multivitamin/mineral or choline conditions as a preliminary evaluation found no differences with the choline condition versus multivitamins/minerals alone. Alcohol use was associated with a significant deficit in Motor performance at 6 months, MDI: F (1, 83) = 2.21, p = 0.14, NS; PDI: F (1, 83) = 5.48, p < 0.02. In contrast, Vitamin/Mineral supplementation resulted in significantly better cognitive performance, MDI: F (1, 83) = 6.04, p < 0.02; PDI: F(1, 83) = 2.42, p = 0.12, NS. There were no significant interactions. Socioeconomic status attenuated effects of alcohol use on motor performance. Cigarette use led to a significant effect on MDI (p < 0.05) and a trend for PDI (p < 0.07). There was no effect of maternal BMI (body mass index) or folic acid use prior to enrollment. However, maternal use of prenatal vitamins before entry into the study was significantly related to MDI. Conclusion: In addition to the expected effects of alcohol exposure on motor development, nutritional intervention resulted in improved cognitive outcomes for these Ukrainian infants providing guidance for future public health recommendations in this emerging democracy.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Individuals with histories of heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol have disruptions in discrete neurocognitive domains, including executive function (EF), and demonstrate lower levels of adaptive functioning. The present study aimed to examine the relationship between EF and adaptive function skills in children and adolescents with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, nonexposed children with a diagnosis of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and typically developing controls. Methods: As part of a multisite study, primary caregivers of 167 children (8-18y, M=12.39) completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS). Children completed selected subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Subjects comprised 3 groups: children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 72), nonexposed children with ADHD (ADHD, n = 35), and typically developing controls (CON, n = 60). Data were analyzed using a series of regression analyses, with VABS subscale as the dependent variable and group, D-KEFS measure, and the interaction term as predictor variables. Followup correlations were run to assess differences within the three groups (ALC, ADHD, CON). Alpha levels were set to 0.01 to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: Overall regression analyses showed that EF measures were predictive of adaptive abilities and that there were significant interactions between D-KEFS measures and group. Follow-up analyses showed that different EF measures were predictive of VABS composite score for each group, as follows: ADHD: Verbal and Design Fluency-Switching, Color Word Interference-Inhibition; ALC: Trail Making-Switching, Color Word Interference-Inhibition, Tower Test; CON: Color Word Interference-Inhibition/Switching. Similar results were found for VABS communication and socialization subscales. Conclusion: These results support prior research in ADHD suggesting that EF deficits are predictive of poorer adaptive behavior skills and extend this finding to include children with heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol. However, the EF variables that predicted adaptive ability differed by group, suggesting unique patterns of abilities in these children. Clinical implications for this research include enhanced ability for clinicians to predict adaptive function abilities in children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Purpose of Study: The current study sought to examine the specificity of neuropsychological deficits associated with FASD by comparing affected children to typically developing controls and similar clinical groups. Methods: Subjects (8-17y, M = 12.92) were selected from a multisite project and comprised 4 groups: children with a history of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 127), nonexposed children with ADHD (ADHD, n = 46), nonexposed children with low IQ scores (IQ, n = 25), and typically developing controls (CON, n = 85). Subjects completed a computerized battery of neuropsychological tests that measured delayed memory, working memory, and executive function. Tasks were from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and included the Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS), the Spatial Working Memory (SWM), and the Intra/Extra Dimensional Shift (IED) tests. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Results indicated that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were impaired on all three tasks and that aspects of spatial working memory were important for distinguishing them from children with ADHD. Omnibus tests revealed significant main effects for test (F = 10.290, p < 0.001) and group (F=9.027, p < 0.001), but not for site (p < 0.05). The site X group interaction also was significant (F = 2.149, p = 0.032) due to the fact that children in the CON group performed differentially across site while those in the ALC, ADHD, and IQ groups performed similarly across site. The ALC group performed more poorly than the CON group on 9 of 11 scores (p < 0.05). The ALC group performed similarly to the other clinical groups on DMS and IED measures (p > 0.05), but were differentiated from children with ADHD on 3 of 4 SWM scores (p < 0.05). These findings do not appear to be attributable to overall IQ deficits as children in the IQ group performed similarly to the ADHD group on these tasks (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Findings suggest that there may be specific deficits in spatial working memory associated with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and that these measures may be useful in the accurate identification of affected children. These findings also demonstrate the utility of a computerized measure in distinguishing children with FASD from similar clinical groups.

N2  - Previous studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with poorer reading and phonological awareness (e.g., Streissguth et al.,1994; Adnams et al., 2007). Fetal alcohol exposure is also associated with slower processing speed (Jacobson et al., 1993, 1994; Kable & Coles., 2004; Burden et al., 2005). The aim of the study was to examine the degree to which effects of alcohol on reading rate and phonological awareness mediate reading comprehension deficits in a heavy alcohol exposed cohort in Cape Town, South Africa. 47 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) children (M age = 11.3, SD = 1.2) were administered the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability and the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhaB). The 31 mothers of the heavy alcohol exposed children reported drinking an average of 5.1 drinks/day, which were concentrated on 2.8 days/week. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with slower reading rate (beta = -0.30, p < 0.05) and poorer reading comprehension (beta = -0.31, p < 0.05), after control for potential confounders including maternal smoking during pregnancy and child age. No differences were seen in relation to child gender. The effect on reading comprehension remained significant after controlling for IQ, suggesting that reading comprehension may be a specific target of alcohol exposure. On the PhaB, prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with slower naming speed for digits and pictures (beta = -0.33 and )0.35, respectively, both ps < 0.05). Prenatal exposure was not related to alliteration or rhyme but was related to poorer performance on spoonerisms, a more challenging form of phonological processing (beta = -0.31, p < 0.05). The effect of alcohol on reading comprehension was mediated by the effect of alcohol on reading rate (z = -2.04, p < 0.05). The effect on reading comprehension was also mediated by spoonerisms (z = -2.09, p < 0.05). These findings indicate deficits in both reading rate, a measure of automaticity, and phonological awareness, two important aspects of reading, mediate the alcohol-related deficits in reading comprehension. The mediating role of reading rate is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating alcohol-related processing speed deficits, which are already evident during infancy, and with recent findings suggesting that white matter integrity may be a specific target of fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure has been associated with impaired verbal learning and memory (Mattson & Roebuck, 2002). The aim of our study was to replicate previous findings on effects of heavy exposure on the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version and to extend these to children with moderate exposure. Data from two prospective longitudinal cohorts were analysed. The Cape Town (CT) Cohort (mean age = 9.2 yr, SD = 0.41) included 6 children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 14 with partial FAS (PFAS), 9 nonsyndromal with heavy exposure (HE), and 18 controls born to abstainers or light drinkers from the same community. The Detroit Cohort (mean age = 14.4 yr; SD = 0.62) included 19 children with heavy exposure (AA/day > 1.0 oz), 21 with moderate exposure (AA/day 0.5- 0.99), and 251 light- to nonexposed (AA/day < 0.5) controls. The primary impairment in the CT heavily-exposed children occurred at the level of encoding new information. There were significant between-group differences in total number of words learned after five learning trials; post hoc analysis indicated that FAS and PFAS groups performed more poorly than controls, ps < 0.05. Consistent with previous research, the CT alcohol-exposed children learned the information at a slower rate than nonexposed controls. Significant short-delay but not longdelay recall deficits were seen in the CT children. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were found between groups for number of words learned across the five learning trials in the moderate-heavy exposed Detroit Cohort. Significant between-groups differences on short- and long-delay recall indicate that the primary impairment for the Detroit alcoholexposed children was at the level of retrieving information. These effects were dosedependent; recall by the moderately-exposed children was intermediate between the light- to nonexposed and heavy-exposed participants, ps < 0.05. Furthermore, alcohol-exposed children in both CT and Detroit showed poorer recognition memory. Thus, only the heavilyexposed children in CT showed learning (encoding) deficits in this relatively simple list learning task, but both moderate and heavy exposure were associated with poorer recognition and recall, suggesting that memory retrieval is particularly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Purpose of the Study. Prenatal alcohol exposure affects neural development and is associated with white matter deficits. The corpus callosum (CC) which joins the left and right hemispheres is frequently affected; neuroimaging studies have identified alterations in white matter integrity in CC. This study examines the extent to which prenatal exposure is associated with inefficiencies in cognitive tasks that require cross callosal transfer of information in order to support the argument that deficits in cognition and behavior observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from effects on brain connectivity in this region. Methods. 234 young adults (M age: 22.78, SD: 1.79) were evaluated as part of a longitudinal study of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four groups of participants included: Unexposed Controls (CON: n = 58), Alcohol Exposed and Dysmorphic (DYSM: n = 47), Alcohol exposed with no physical effects (ETOH: n = 75), and Unexposed volunteers who qualified for Special Education Services as children (SpecED = 54). Neuropsychological assessment included the following measures that require cross-callosal transfer of information for efficient performance: Sensory: Finger Localization (Benedetti, 1988); Auditory: Dichotic listening measured using the Scan-A (Keith, 1995), Visual: Visual Alexia (Leff, et al. 2001). Subtests of these measures, which required integration of information across hemisphere, were selected. These included the Bilateral Condition on finger localization, Competing Reversal on the Scan-A and identification of words in the left visual field on Visual Alexia. Results. For each assessment measure, multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures compared performance among the four experimental groups. Deficits in performance by the DYSM Group were noted on all measures of interest. However, measures sensitive to cross callosal interference were not more affected than other outcomes and interactions between group status and laterality measures were not found. Conclusion. Alcohol-affected young adults demonstrated a generalized deficit in cognitive performance across a number of measures. However, these deficits are not confined to those measures associated with cross modal transmission of information suggesting that deficits cannot be attributed to effects of their prenatal exposure on callosal functioning. It is more likely that there is a general loss of processing efficiency.

N2  - The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) is a heteromeric tetramer composed of two obligatory NR1 subunits along with two modulatory NR2 (A-D) or NR3 (A-B) subunits. The NMDAR has been shown to play a critical role in learning and memory and, consequently, has been a focus of studies aiming to identify mechanisms that underlie the detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on cognition. Our lab has previously shown that NMDAR-dependent activation (phosphorylation) of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), which plays a critical role in various forms of learning and memory, is reduced in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of PAE mice compared to saccharin controls (Samudio-Ruiz et al. 2009). We sought to determine whether this observed deficit in ERK1/2 activation may be associated with reduced synaptic levels of NMDARs, as synaptic NMDARs have been reported to be coupled to signaling pathways leading to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Mice were exposed to alcohol (or saccharin, control) throughout pregnancy using a limited (4-hr) access model of alcohol self-administration; blood alcohol levels of 70-100 mg/dL were achieved with this model. Offspring were raised to adulthood (3-5 months) and the dentate gyrus was microdissected. Synaptic membranes were isolated from the dentate gyrus and the associated NMDAR subunit NR1 and NR2B levels were determined by semiquantitative immunoblotting. Compared to saccharin controls, NR1 subunit levels were significantly increased (t(8) = 4.58, p < 0.01; n = 5 each group), while NR2B subunit were significantly decreased (t(8) = 2.41, p < 0.05; n = 5 each group), in PAE mice. These preliminary results indicate that reduced synaptic levels of NMDAR NR2B subunitcontaining receptors may contribute to the decreased activation of ERK1/2 previously seen in the dentate gyrus of mice prenatally exposed to alcohol. Identification of the mechanisms underlying the observed alterations in NMDAR subcellular distribution in the dentate gyrus may provide targets for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of the behavioral and cognitive deficits that are associated with PAE.

N2  - Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are at high risk for secondary disabilities (e.g., mental health problems, trouble with the law, school disruptions). Rates of secondary disabilities are especially high for youth with PAE who are raised in unstable or chaotic homes, have frequent changes of household, are the victims of violence, and/or do not receive an early diagnosis. These risk factors are very common for children with PAE in foster care. Preventive interventions for youth with PAE may reduce the onset and/or severity of secondary disabilities by targeting risk and protective factors. Using a multiple case study approach, the current study sought to evaluate whether the Fostering Healthy Futures (FHF) preventive intervention, designed for preadolescent youth (ages 9 to 11) in foster care, was beneficial for a subsample of youth with documented PAE. The 30-week FHF intervention included weekly therapeutic skills groups and individual mentoring. Retrospective chart review was utilized to identify children with PAE who had participated in FHF. Children were selected for the current study if child welfare records explicitly stated the mother had consumed alcohol during pregnancy with the target child. Outcome data were derived from baseline and longitudinal follow-up interviews with multiple informants, intervention progress notes and ratings, and available school and child welfare records. Findings indicate youth with PAE (n = 4; ages 10 to 11 at baseline) demonstrated moderate to high levels of engagement and enjoyment in mentoring and skills group activities, even though most of them struggled to fully grasp didactic content. While several of the youth struggled with behavioral problems in other settings, none displayed behavioral problems in the group setting. The child-mentor relationship was rated by clinical staff as having a positive impact for all 4 youth. Short (immediate and 6 months postintervention) and longer-term (1.5 to 2.5 years postintervention) outcomes were variable across youth and across time. In general, mental health, delinquency, and school disruptions tended to be stable or worsen over time. It is important to note that 3 of the 4 youth reunified with their biological mothers during the course of the intervention and all 3 of these families were living in poverty. Study findings will be discussed relative to their implications for the development of a preventive intervention targeted specifically for youth with PAE.

N2  - A pilot study examining the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of choline supplementation in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is underway. Preclinical data (J. Thomas et al.) suggest that post-natal choline supplementation in rats may attenuate some of the cognitive and behavioral abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. The literature shows that peri-natal choline supplementation has direct positive effects on hippocampal growth and function in normal development and in pre-natal alcohol exposure. No human choline trials have yet been completed in FASD. Twenty children between the ages of 2.5 and 5.0 years have been enrolled in a nine-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of choline supplementation. The dose, 500 mg per day, is double the recommended daily intake level but below the upper tolerable limit for this age (100 mg). Outcome data currently being collected include measures of global cognitive development (Mullen Scales), memory (elicited imitation paradigm, P. Bauer), executive functioning (conflict / delay, S. Carlson), behavior ratings (Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist), and evoked response potential (ERP) / visually evoked potential (VEP) measures. Thus far, only one child has dropped out (because of refusal to take the study agent). There have been no adverse events. Compliance has been very good as evidenced by packet counts, logsheets, and serum choline levels collected at baseline and 1 month (presented here). Administration of the study agent has been modified slightly in 9 cases (dose splitting, adulterating, etc.) in order to improve child compliance. Reports of potential side effects have been low. Most commonly seen have been fishy body odor and increased urination. Because the blind is still in place, it is not yet known if there are group differences in these or other potential side effects. Thus far, choline supplementation at 500 mg. per day appears to be associated with minimal side effects and is reasonably well-tolerated by 2-4 year old children with FASD. Parental interest and compliance have been strong over the course of the study.

N2  - Background. Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) depends on health care providers detecting maternal risk drinking in pregnancy. NIAAA and ACOG recommend using the T-ACE, an economical/sensitive screen. We reported that a more stringent T-ACE total score cut-point (3 vs. 2) increased specificity in identifying maternal risk drinking and alcoholrelated neurobehavioral dysfunction in children (Chiodo et al, 2010). If validated, the TACER3 could increase efficient clinical practice. Objective. Assess how changing the T-ACE cut-point affects detection of risk drinking. Methods. Self-reported peri-conceptional and in-pregnancy drinking was assessed with semistructured interviews and alcohol screens in a prospective subsample of 239 African-American mothers given an in-pregnancy T-ACE. Both the original T-ACE risk criterion (total score of 2 - T-ACE) and the revised T-ACE definition criterion (total score of 3 - TACER3) were analyzed. ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons compared prepregnancy and pregnancy alcohol consumption quantity and frequency measures by risk category. Categories include: 1) No Risk Group (NRG) = no risk for pregnancy alcohol use based on both T-ACE and TACER3 criteria (n = 140); 2) At Risk Group (ARG) based on both T-ACE and TACER3 criteria (n = 28); and 3) Change Risk Group (CRG) identified as at-risk with the original T-ACE criterion but not at-risk using the revised TACER3 criterion (n = 71). Results. The 71 women (30%) in the Change Risk Group (CRG) had patterns of alcohol use similar to the no risk group (NRG). As predicted, post hoc analysis revealed that the at-risk group (ARG) had significantly more alcohol use both prior to and during pregnancy than either the NRG or CRG groups. Conclusion. The data presented provides further evidence that adjusting the T-ACE total score cut point to 3 in the TACER3 is clinically appropriate, removes nonrisk drinking women from potential intervention without missing women who are drinking at risk levels during pregnancy. Using the TACER3 criteria, only 12% of women would require intervention, while using the TACE criteria, 41% of women would score as at-risk and would require physician intervention. Increasing the total T-ACE score criterion from 2 to 3 results in fewer "false positives," reducing physician time with these patients and allowing a more intensive targeted clinical response for pregnant women correctly identified as drinking at fetal risk levels.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes significant structural and functional damage to the brain. Despite warnings to reduce alcohol abuse during pregnancy, prenatal alcohol exposure remains a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. The activity-dependent neuroprotective peptide NAPVSIPQ (NAP) has been shown to prevent alcohol-induced fetal teratogenesis, growth deficits, and postnatal behavioral impairments in a mouse model of heavy binge alcohol exposure via maternal intraperitoneal alcohol injection. The goal of the current study was to determine whether maternal consumption of an alcohol liquid diet alters behavior (locomotor activity and spatial learning) in adult offspring, and whether prenatal NAP co-administration improves behavioral outcomes. On gestational days 7-16, C57BL/6 dams were given either an ad lib chow diet, 4.8% (v/v) ethanol liquid diet, or were pair fed an isocaloric control diet. The adult offspring (~90 days) were tested in an open field in daily 10- min sessions on two consecutive days. Locomotor activity was monitored with computerbased video tracking and the distance traveled and time spent in designated regions of the open field was measured. The mice were then given 10 consecutive days of training on a place-learning task in the Morris water maze (127-cm tank). Each daily training session consisted of four trials (3-min intertrial interval) in which the mouse was given up to 60 sec to swim to find a 9-cm diameter escape platform submerged in a designated location. Measures of acquisition learning, obtained via computer-based video tracking, included path lengths and latencies to reach the platform. On days 5 and 10, an additional 60-sec probe trial was given in which the platform was removed and the search pattern was quantified as the amount of time spent within 27 cm of the center of the target location. NAP treatment in the alcoholexposed group was associated with less total distance traveled in the open field. There were no alcohol treatment effects on place learning acquisition measures. The alcohol + NAP group showed increased time searching within the target location than the alcohol group not given NAP, consistent with improved spatial memory in the NAP-treated group. The control groups were not significantly affected by the NAP treatment. NAP treatments may improve some behavioral functions affected by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Ethanol exposure during pregnancy is known to alter fetal brain development through cellular apoptosis. Although there is no method of prevention, studies from us and others showed that derived peptide from activity dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) can be used as a trophic peptide for neuroprotection. In this study, we further characterize the proteomic architecture underlying the role of ADNF-9 against ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E13 with either a 25% ethanol derived calorie (25% EDC, ALC), 25% EDC simultaneously administered ADNF-9 (ALC-ADNF-9), or pair-fed (PF) liquid diets. At E13, fetal brains were collected from 5 dams for each group. Individual brains were homogenized and the extracted proteins were then tryptically digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Label-free quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on proteomes extracted from fetal brains of all three ALC, ALCADNF- 9, and PF groups. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) score plots of the abundances of all proteins identified in the three groups were analyzed. Statistical differences in the areas and number of proteins between PF and ALC groups (137 proteins), PF and ALC-ADNF-9 groups (228 proteins), and ALC and ALC-ADNF-9 groups (23 proteins) resulted in a distinct data-clustering thus yielding obvious separation of the sample groups in the PCA score plot. The statistical analyses demonstrated significant upregulation of several proteins including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p = 0.009023), dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 1 (p = 0.009023), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (p = 0.02828), microtubule-associated protein 1B (p = 0.02828), eukaryotic translation initiation factor (p = 0.02828), histone-binding protein RBBP4 (p = 0.02828), and nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1 (p = 0.016294) in ALC-ADNF-9 group as compared to ALC group. These findings provide information about possible mechanisms underlying the effects of ADNF-9 in neuroprotection against the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure during early embryonic stage.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) exhibit long lasting behavioral impairments, such as learning disabilities, problems in executive functioning and memory deficits. Using a rat model of voluntary drinking during pregnancy, we have shown that the antagonism of histamine H3 receptors reverses fetal ethanol-induced deficits learning and dentate granule cell long-term potentiation. Given that H3 receptors inhibit neurotransmitter release, we hypothesized that fetal alcohol exposure elevates H3 receptor-mediated depression of glutamate release from perforant path nerve terminals in the dentate gyrus. In the present study, this hypothesis was examined using two different approaches. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed an average of 2.72 g/kg/ day of 5% sweetened ethanol solution throughout gestation. This level of consumption produces a mean peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. No differences in offspring birthweight or litter size were observed. In the first experiment, we examined the effects of moderate prenatal ethanol exposure on methimepip-stimulated [35S]-GTPcS binding. H3 receptor agonist-stimulated GTP binding in the dorsal dentate gyrus was significantly increased in fetal ethanol-exposed offspring. Second, we examined H3 modulation of paired-pulse plasticity, an indirect measure of neurotransmitter release, in dentate gyrus slices of prenatally exposed offspring and controls. Evoked perforant path to dentate field potentials were not affected by prenatal exposure to ethanol. Bath application of methimepip, another H3 agonist, did not affect paired pulse ratio (PPR) in control offspring, but significantly increased PPR in ethanol exposed offspring, indicating a net decrease in evoked glutamate release. Methimepip effects in the ethanol exposed group were partially reversed by concomitant application of ABT-239, a histamine H3 antagonist. Taken together, these results suggest a heightened H3 receptor-mediated modulation of glutamate release in the dentate gyrus of fetal-ethanol exposed rats. We expect that these experiments will provide insights into the mechanisms by which prenatal ethanol exposure affects synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-sensitive learning. A better understanding of this phenomenon may provide targets for therapeutic intervention in children with FASD.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and autopsy studies reveal abnormal cerebellar development in children who had been exposed to alcohol prenatally, independent of the exposure period. We previously reported that prenatal alcohol exposure during the first, third or all three trimester equivalent of human brain development reduces cerebellar Purkinje cell number in prenatal lambs. In the present study, ewes received binge paradigm alcohol exposure (3 days on, 4 days off, 1.75 g/kg administered IV as a 40% solution) during the first (E1, gestational days 4-41) or all three (E3, gestation days 4 to 132) trimester equivalent. Lambs were born, the faces were evaluated for facial dysmorphology (reported elsewhere) and they were subjected to spatial delayed alteration and classical eyeblink conditioning learning testing (reported elsewhere). Lambs were then sacrificed and whole brains and brain components were weighed and cerebellar Purkinje cells were counted utilizing unbiased stereology procedures. Purkinje cell number in E1 and E3 exposed lamb groups were significantly reduced compared to normal and saline control groups (8.7 +/- 0.4, 9.3 +/- 0.6, 14.2 +/- 1.1, 12.6 +/- 1.3 x 107 mean +/- SEM, n = 7, 8, 5, 7 respectively) . There were no significant differences in whole brain or brain component weights. Interestingly, we did not find behavioral deficits. However, a subset of facial measures obtained at birth classified alcoholexposed and non-alcohol exposed lambs wwith 72% sensitivity and 83% specificity suggesting that alcohol-induced changes in the face can predict altered neurodevelopmental development. All or part of this work was done in conjunction with the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), which is funded by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA).

N2  - Purpose of Study: Heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol leads to widespread cognitive deficits, including problems with attention and response inhibition. However, the effect of implicit cuing on inhibition remains unclear. This study examined blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in children with and without histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during a task of response inhibition consisting of cued and uncued trials. Methods: Children and adolescents (ages 8-18y) with (ALC = 20) and without (CON = 15) heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a Go/No-Go task. There were no significant differences in age, race, ethnicity, sex, handedness, or socioeconomic status between the two groups. Go stimuli consisted of large circles, small circles, and large squares, and no-go stimuli consisted of small squares. Unbeknownst to subjects, the large square served as a predictive cue and was followed by a No-Go trial in 87% of trials. Results: Groups did not differ on most measures of task performance (i.e., hit rate, false alarm rate, correct inhibition, false alarms, discriminability, and response bias). However, following cued stimuli, the ALC group demonstrated a lower hit rate [F(1,27) = 4.94, p = 0.035] and more conservative response bias [F(1,27) = 5.84, p = 0.023] compared to the CON group. Alcohol-exposed participants demonstrated more activation during No-Go trials (inhibition) relative to Go trials in the left precuneus, cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate and right medial frontal gyrus (p < 0.05). During cue-dependent response inhibition, the ALC group demonstrated less activation in the left pre-central and post-central gyrus (p = 0.01) compared to the CON group. Conclusion: Consistent with previous studies of response inhibition, alcohol-exposed children demonstrated greater frontal activation during inhibition than controls, despite similar task performance. This study further demonstrated that alcohol-exposed children had impaired behavioral performance on cued trials and demonstrated less activation in the pre-central and post-central gyrus relative to controls on these trials. Activation of the pre- and post-central gyri has been shown in studies of sequence-specific implicit motor learning, thus implicit sequence learning may be affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol, given the decrease in activation in this area in affected children.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with deficits in working memory, but it is not clear how this impairment is related to the functional organization of working memory in the brain. A standard verbal n-back task was administered to 47 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) children from a prospective longitudinal cohort in Cape Town, South Africa, where there is an exceptionally high incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and related disorders. The cohort included 17 children with FAS or partial FAS (PFAS), 13 heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE), and 17 non- or light exposed controls. All but one child with FAS were right-handed. All three groups of children (M age=9.4 yr, SD=0.4; 23 boys, 24 girls) performed well on a 1-back task administered in our neuropsychological laboratory and in a Siemens 3T Allegra scanner, but only the children in the nonexposed control group performed better than chance on a 2-back task. The n-back paradigm administered in the scanner alternated between blocks of 0-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), 1-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), and rest (20 s). Data were analyzed in SPM8, using standard methods. Intra-group one-sample t-tests were used to identify the principal regions recruited under conditions of working memory (1-back > 0-back). Analyses were conducted in 5 regions of interest (ROIs) central to verbal working memory: dorsal prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, caudate/putamen, parietal cortex, and cerebellar crus I and II. Cluster extent thresholds were determined using AlphaSim based on 104 Monte Carlo simulations across the individual ROIs. Controls recruited left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), suggesting use of a verbal rehearsal strategy to perform the task. By comparison, the HE group recruited a broad range of fronto-striatal regions, including left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left caudate. These frontostriatal regions were not recruited by the FAS/ PFAS group, who instead relied on crus I and II within the cerebellum and parietal cortex. These findings suggest differential functional organization of the brain's basic cognitive systems in children with different forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, when compared with nonexposed controls. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that children who meet diagnostic criteria for FAS and PFAS use qualitatively different compensatory strategies to perform a simple cognitive task than those used by heavily exposed nonsyndromal children.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Research suggests that white matter microstructure abnormalities in individuals with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure contribute to mathematical learning difficulties. This study examined white matter microstructure differences associated with discrepancies between IQ and reading and math achievement measures. Methods: Youth, aged 8 to 18, with (ALC=14) and without (CON=12) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological assessment. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values, a measure of white matter integrity, were used from 19 brain regions previously reported to differ between groups. Discrepancy scores were computed as follows: verbal ability (VIQ)-WRAT-3 Reading score and nonverbal ability (PIQ)-WRAT-3 Arithmetic score. Pearson's correlation coefficients quantified the relation between FA and discrepancy scores. Results: Across groups, 3 regions were significantly associated with verbal discrepancy scores and 4 regions with nonverbal discrepancy scores. Further analyses within the ALC group revealed positive correlations (p < 0.01) between nonverbal discrepancy scores in the right posterior limb of the internal capsule and right cingulum. Alternately, the CON group showed negative correlations (p < 0.05) between nonverbal discrepancy scores and the left forceps major and bilaterally with posterior corona radiata and a positive correlation (p < 0.05) with the right uncinate fasciculus. Within the verbal domain, individuals in the ALC group showed a positive correlation (p < 0.05) in the right posterior corona radiata and forceps major and right uncinate fasciculus. No significant correlations were found in the CON group. There were no regions where both groups demonstrated the same relationship between regions and discrepancy scores. All correlations remained significant after controlling for age. Conclusion: Alterations in white matter microstructure, as a result of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, may contribute to reading and mathematical learning disorders. This study demonstrates the clinical relevance of white matter changes in this population, and the utility of neuroimaging methods for assessing these changes. The continued use of neuroimaging methods will help elucidate the effect of alcohol on brain development and identify relationships between brain and behavior.

N2  - Eyeblink conditioning (EBC), which involves temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (a tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (an air puff), has been shown to be consistently impaired in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). A growing body of evidence suggests that white matter may be a specific target of alcohol teratogenesis. This study used DTI to examine the degree to which the fetal alcohol-related deficit in EBC may be mediated by structural impairment in the cerebellar peduncles, an important white matter component of the welldocumented EBC circuit. 13 children with FAS/PFAS and 12 matched controls (9.7 to 13.7 yr) were scanned using DTI and MPRAGE MRI sequences on a 3T MAGNETOM Allegra. A voxelwise analysis was performed on fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity images. Type I error was controlled by setting a cluster volume threshold at a voxel level significance of p < 0.01. Two EBC tasks were administered: delay, in which there was a 650ms delay between the onset of a 750 ms tone and an air puff, and trace, in which a 500ms interval occurred between the offset of a 750 ms tone and the onset of the puff. Alcohol-exposed vs. control group differences in FA and perpendicular diffusivity were identified in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. These group differences, which remained significant even after controlling for brain and cerebellar volumes, were dose-dependent. Trace conditioning was related to higher FA and lower perpendicular diffusivity in that same area of the left middle peduncle. Trends for delay conditioning were similar but fell short of statistical significance in this small sample. The standardized regression coefficient relating prenatal alcohol to trace conditioning decreased from )0.61 to )0.28 when FA was entered into a regression analysis. This decrease, which was statistically significant (t = -2.38, p < 0.05), suggests that the effect of prenatal alcohol on trace conditioning is mediated, in part, by lower FA. The effect of alcohol exposure on trace conditioning was also significantly mediated by cerebellar white matter volume but not by total brain, cerebellar, or cerebellar gray matter volume. This study extends recent findings that have used DTI to reveal microstructural deficits in white matter in children with FASD. The results suggest mediation of the fetal alcohol-related effect on EBC by deficits in cerebellar white matter volume and integrity.

N2  - Exposure of the developing fetus to alcohol during pregnancy causes a myriad of abnormalities leading to phenotypes collectively known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). A leading cause of mental retardation, FASD is a major public health problem. One of the most prominent pathologic effects of alcohol in the fetal brain is neuronal death. However, there is currently no available preventive measure for protecting developing neurons against alcohol toxicity. One of the major goals of our laboratory has been to identify agents that can prevent alcohol-induced neuronal death. We have previously demonstrated that stimulation of the cAMP pathway protects immature neurons against alcohol toxicity. Because elevated intracellular cAMP concentrations activate this pathway, agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels may protect neurons against alcohol toxicity. Rolipram is a commercially available phosphodiesterase inhibitor that blocks the degradation of cAMP specifically in neurons. We hypothesized that Rolipram can protect developing neurons against alcohol toxicity by increasing intracellular cAMP levels to stimulate the cAMP-PKACREB pathway. As a first step, using an adenoviral reporter vector, we demonstrated that rolipram stimulates the cAMP pathway in cerebellar granule neurons. We further showed that Rolipram induces phosphorylation of the CREB transcription factor, which is the downstream effector molecule of the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway. In addition, we demonstrated that cerebellar granule neurons exposed to alcohol (0 or 400 mg/dl) in vitro were protected against alcohol toxicity by rolipram (5 to 20 uM) in a dose dependent manner. Whereas alcohol killed nearly 25% of neurons, Rolipram reduced the cell death to less then 5%. These results suggest that Rolipram may ameliorate alcohol-induced neurotoxicity in the developing brain by stimulating the neuroprotective cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during gestation is responsible for a wide spectrum of symptoms in the developing fetus under the umbrella of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Defects affect the central nervous system, craniofacial structures, mental ability, and growth. However, the underlying mechanism by which ethanol (EtOH) acts during embryonic development is still poorly understood at the molecular level. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) as a model for FASD, we have previously reported (Arzumanyan et al., 2009, Ogony et al., 2010; Vadigepalli et al., 2010) that EtOH modulates the protein level of several transcription factors (TFs) during cell differentiation towards neuronal fate. Here we study the EtOH effects on the steady state level of TF transcripts during ES cell differentiation. E14Tg2a.4 ES cells were differentiated for different times in an adherent culture in a medium supplemented with retinoic acid (RA, 10nM), in the presence or absence of EtOH (100mM). Cells were characterized by morphology and staining with alkaline phosphatase, and immunocytochemistry for pluripotency-associated TFs Sox2, Nanog, Pou5f1, and markers of the three lineage layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm). We have evaluated TFs of the ES cell regulatory network and their target genes, using a novel microfluidic high throughput BioMark platform and dynamic arrays of 48.48 (assays x samples = 2304) and 96.96 (9216) real time PCR measurements. Transcript levels were quantified by the comparative Ct method and normalized to the expression of housekeeping genes. We determined the expression of markers of pluripotency and self-renewal (e.g., Sox2, Nanog, Pou5f1, Klf4, Dax1, Rex1, Esrrb), and neuroectodermal lineage related genes (e.g., Cxcl12, Nestin, Neurog, Notch, Pax6, Sox3, Sox4, Ascl1, Meis1, Zic1). Data show that during ES cell differentiation EtOH delays the downregulation of pluripotency markers like Sox2, Nanog and Pou5f1 (Oct4) and consequently perturbs the upregulation of target differentiation genes, interfering with the commitment of ES cells to neuroectodermal lineage. Our findings provide insights into the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of ES cell differentiation and may lead to a better understanding of developmental defects observed in FASD.

N2  - Increasing evidence indicates that the majority of children adversely affected by fetal alcohol exposure do not present with birth defects. Without physical signs suggestive of prenatal alcohol exposure, accurate information about maternal drinking is required for a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and to consider early interventions. This study assesses a combination of biomarkers capable of capturing different patterns of alcohol use because no single ethanol biomarker is sensitive or specific enough to reliably assess alcohol consumption. In 2009, the University of New Mexico (UNM) established a cohort study of pregnant women attending the UNM-affiliated substance abuse treatment program to evaluate validity of a broad array of maternal and fetal/newborn biomarkers. Eligible patients are screened and enrolled during one of the first prenatal care visits and are followed-up throughout pregnancy to early postpartum period. In addition to structured maternal interviews to assess quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, a broad array of biomarkers of alcohol exposure is evaluated. Biomarkers that capture recent exposure (several days to 3 weeks) include ethyl glucuronide (EtG), phosphatidylethanol (PEth), and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (%CDT). Gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) can identify more chronic exposure. In addition, some biomarkers might be useful for identifying cumulative exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, i.e., meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). Lastly, we are investigating biomarker's validity in novel media, e.g., hair analysis of EtG and FAEE, PEth in dried blood spots on a filter paper collected during the routine newborn screen. Some of the unique challenges for this prospective study include identification of subjects at the admission to the UNM hospital for labor and delivery and collection of biological samples according to the study protocol within the first 24 hours since admission. The following activities have been implemented at UNM hospital to facilitate timely collection and processing of maternal and newborn specimens: 1) intensive in-service training of the nursing personnel in research-related activities; 2) installation of an ultra-low temperature freezer at the Mother-Baby Unit to facilitate processing of meconium samples; 3) development of research orders in electronic medical records of study participants to be initiated by the nursing staff in the Labor and Delivery and Newborn Nursery units; 4) collaboration with the UNM Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) pediatric research nurses While meconium collection presents unique challenges, we were able to collect samples from n > 90% of infants born to cohort participants. Our results also indicate that 98% of the cohort participants consented to collection of scalp hair. Given the difficulties of confirming maternal drinking during pregnancy, as well as diagnosing less severe cases of FASD during the neonatal period, the development of better biomarkers, either alone or in combination with other measures, would facilitate earlier identification of affected children and allow for earlier interventions to maximize a child's long-term prognosis.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of permanent neurodevelopmental disability and affect 2-5% of live births. A major dilemma is that FASD severity varies widely even after controlling for maternal alcohol intake. The mechanism/s underlying this variance is unknown. We examined the influence of maternal iron status because gestational iron deficiency (ID) causes neurodevelopmental impairments that parallel those of FASD. Moreover, ethanol dysregulates iron homeostasis through its effects on hepcidin expression. Here we show that maternal iron status is a selective and synergistic modifier of alcohol's neurotoxicity. We used an established rat model of third trimester-equivalent binge drinking, in which pups received 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg ethanol daily from postnatal days (P) 5-9; this targeted the ethanol-sensitive brain growth spurt period. Pups were reared using iron-sufficient (IS, 100 ppm) or ID (4 ppm) diets from GD13.5 until weaning, when all received IS diets to P35, when their neurobehavior was evaluated. Whereas ID dams had largely normal iron indicators, the ID offspring were anemic and had significantly decreased iron indicators. Iron status did not affect blood ethanol levels or clearance. We found that iron status significantly impacted key diagnostics of FASD. One of these is somatic growth, which was significantly reduced by the ID+alcohol combination (p<0.001). Neurobehavioral disabilities are the most devastating outcomes of FASD; we tested a range of behaviors at P35, when iron status had normalized. Separately, ID and alcohol had little effect on behavioral outcomes. However, ID+alcohol synergized to profoundly worsen associative learning as measured using multiple tasks including short-delay and trace eyeblink classical conditioning (p=0.022), and auditory and contextural fear conditioning (p=0.008). The ID+alcohol interaction was selective because other tasks (limb grip strength, motor coordination, open field behavior) were largely unaffected by ID or alcohol singly or in combination. We evaluated brain morphology to gain insights into mechanism. At P10 ID+alcohol did not affect neuronal proliferation (phosphohistone H3) but additively increased neuronal apoptosis (caspase-3, p=0.004) within the cerebellum. The increased cerebellar apoptosis in ID+alcohol resulted, at P35, with significantly fewer of the Purkinje and interpositus neurons that mediate ECC learning, as measured using unbiased stereology. Cerebellar secondary myelination was also significantly reduced by the ID+alcohol combination, measured using immunostain for myelin basic protein. Myelination and cell survival are separately and modestly impaired by ID and alcohol; we suggest that their synergistic disruption by ID+alcohol selectively impaired associative learning. We conclude that maternal iron status is a hitherto unappreciated and potent modifier of alcohol's neurotoxicity. The findings also offer novel insights into how ID and alcohol damage the developing brain. FASD is difficult to prevent because alcoholics do not reveal their drinking behavior. These findings have significant public health implications given the high rates of alcohol abuse and ID in childbearing-age women. We propose that aggressive screening and treatment of maternal ID is a safe and clinically achievable approach to improve FASD outcomes.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which manifests itself in the form of physiological defects, mental retardation and neurobehavioural deficits, the latter of which is rarely diagnosed. Since maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure and risk for FASD. While Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters (FAEEs) are current biomarkers of exposure, the introduction of a second biomarker that can be tested alongside FAEEs promises to greatly increase the sensitivity and specificity of analytical screens. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium, or first stool of life, of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Whether this detected EtG was formed by the maternal liver and crossed the placenta, by the fetal liver after ethanol crossed the placenta, or by the placenta itself remains unknown. Objectives: To determine if, and to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta, and to measure placental formation and degradation of EtG. Methods: Placentae from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario will be taken to the onsite perfusion laboratory. One mug/mL EtG will be added to the maternal reservoir and maternal and fetal samples will be taken over a 3 hour period to determine if and to what degree EtG is crossing the human placenta. EtG will be quantified using HS-SPME GCMS. Placental metabolism of ethanol to EtG and EtG to ethanol will be investigated using placental microsomes. Kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km) will also be determined to help elucidate the role of the placenta in formation and degradation of EtG. Results: To date the perfusions are being carried out and the level of EtG in the perfusate will be determined using HS-SPME GC-MS with a limit of sensitivity of 1 ng/vial. Conclusions: We have developed a HS-SPME method for detecting EtG in maternal and fetal perfusate samples. This will allow us to accurately quantify the transfer of EtG across the human placenta.

N2  - Background: Based on our clinical observation that Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS, a neurologic sensorimotor disorder characterized by a range of sensations from discomfort to pain) is a major cause of insomnia in children and adolescents with FASD, we hypothesized that rat offspring with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) may exhibit altered movements during sleep compared to those in control animals. To investigate this, we first had to test the applicability of our overnight-video-sleepstudies system for monitoring activities/sleep of rats. Methods: 2 control, 2 PAE male Sprague Dawley rats were videotaped in specially equipped cages for a total of 8 hrs during the lights on period. Equipment included infrared-light camera, netbook with synchronized audio/video software, and live time-stamp, constant frame-rates. Results: Awake/asleep states, defined as open/closed eyes and responsive/unresponsiveness were identified. Overall, the following were found: awake: 146/140 min, asleep: 267/278 min, transitioning between awake/sleep: 64/63 min. We were able to observe behavioural patterns including prolonged grooming/head shivering activities before falling asleep, arousals and some active limb movements while asleep, which appeared to differ between PAE and control animals. We were not able to count leg movements reliably as sleeping position hindered observation of lower/upper limbs. Discussion: The video methodology opens a new option for behavioural-sleep-observations in the rat model. While head and body movement can clearly be described, the study must be repeated with a larger sample size, and the relationship of these observations to RLS must still be demonstrated.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Alcohol is globally consumed, and its long term adverse effects on fetal development are well characterized. However, in utero alcohol exposure does not always result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study explores the role of ecogenetic and epigenetic factors in FASD. We hypothesize that ecogenetic and epigenetic factors determine susceptibility to FASD. Methods: To test this hypothesis we examined the prevalence of FASD between two disparate population groups; one in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada and the other in Moyo, Northern Uganda. Moyo was chosen because alcohol consumption in the district is especially widespread and yet alcohol-related behavioral and academic issues are rare. In PEI, FASD is a significant public health concern. Both Moyo and PEI are remote regions with stable populations of comparable size. Children aged 2 years to 10 years exposed in utero to alcohol as determined by maternal history were assessed by a dysmophologist/paediatrician for clinical features of FASD. Results: Fifty seven (57/87 or 65.5%) Moyo mothers and 49 (49/89 or 55%) PEI mothers admitted to consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Based on maternal history a total of 65 Moyo children and 52 PEI children were exposed in utero to alcohol. Twentysix or 40% Moyo children and 42 or 80% PEI children were confirmed to have FASD. Conclusions/Discussions: PEI children exposed in utero to alcohol are significantly more likely to have FASD than Moyo children (p<0.01). Differences in ecogenetic and epigenetic factors are postulated to be the explanation for the two-fold difference in FASD prevalence between Moyo and PEI children. These findings are preliminary and warrant further and larger studies that analyze ecogenetic and epigenetic factors that could influence risk susceptibility to FASD.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Adaptive functioning (AF) deficits are common in individuals with FASD. Although IQ is predictive of AF in other populations (Liss et al., 2001) 1, this is not the case in FASD. Schonfeld and colleagues (2006)2 found that executive functioning (EF) predicted social skills in individuals with FASD, however, there are no studies linking EF with AF in FASD. Methods: Participants (aged 6 - 16) were in two groups, FASD (N=41) and prenatal alcohol exposure, not meeting criteria for FASD (PAE; N=26). Parents rated their child's EF and AF, using the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System Second Edition (ABAS-II), respectively. We also examined whether IQ, age of assessment, SES, and home stability were related to AF. Results: Based on one-way ANOVAs, the PAE group performed significantly better than the FASD group on all of the ABAS composites, the BRIEF Metacognitive Index (MI), and approached significance on the BRIEF Global Executive Composite. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that the BRIEF MI was the best predictor of the General Adaptive, Conceptual, and Practical ABAS-II composites, but nothing predicted the Social composite. IQ only predicted scores on the Conceptual composite. Conclusions/Discussion: We found EF to be a better predictor of AF than IQ and other environmental factors. This has implications for policy and services: many disability services are not available to individuals with FASD and PAE because they have IQs above 70, whereas EF measures may be more informative for severe impairments in AF.

N2  - Background: The Neurobehavioral Screening Tool (NST) is a part of the National Screening Tool Kit for FASD. The NST is a parental rating scale consisting of ten questions identified by Nash et al. (2006) to be predictive of FASD based on the child's current behaviour. The purpose of this study was to field test the NST to determine how well it differentiates between children diagnosed with FASD, those with PAE but no FASD diagnosis, and typically developing controls. Methods: We administered the NST to three groups of children (6 to 17 years): 36 with FASD and 21 PAE assessed at the Glenrose Hospital FASD clinic in Edmonton, and 21 controls recruited locally. Results: Significantly more children with FASD screened positive on the NST compared to the PAE and the control group. The sensitivity of the NST in our sample was 36.1%. Within the FASD group, there was a higher sensitivity among older participants (50%) 12- 17 years, than younger participants (22%) 6-11 years. The NST had 100% specificity against the control group; none of the controls tested positively. Discussion: Despite overall low sensitivity, the specificity in our sample is very high indicating that the selected items are specific to FASD. This supports the use of the NST as a national screening tool which would lead to large numbers of children being screened and undergoing the process of diagnosis.

N2  - Background. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the strongest manifestation of FASD, results in short stature, microcephally and facial dysmorphogenesis including microphthalmia. One of the criteria for the diagnosis of FAS is the assessment of alcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to make a photo of drinking habits during pregnancy. Methods. Preliminary results of this survey are underway to 582 unselected pregnant women, of different nationalities, who refer at Department of Obstetrics Gynaecology Urology Science, Sapienza University of Rome. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered, assessing the unit of alcohol introduced by their daily habits as well as alterations of consumption during the pregnancy. Results. This study shows that before pregnancy, 68.5% consume alcohol regularly in quantities and of these 25.3% did not change their habits during pregnancy. We found that in the first trimester 33. 3% drink and 5. 6% of this intake whenever more than one drink. In the second, 35. 1% consume alcohol and 7. 5% of this intake more than one drink. Finally, in the third trimester on 37. 8% of women who drink, 3. 3% consume alcohol more than one drink. Conclusions. Most women do not know how much drinking during pregnancy is dangerous for fetus. There is currently no cure for FAS, so there is only one sure way to prevent fetal alcohol-related conditions: completely avoid the use of alcohol during pregnancy. The consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can harm the developing fetus at all stages of pregnancy. It is therefore important to have a wide program of education. And it is essential that physicians adequately sensitize women who are pregnant or intend to start.

N2  - Absorption of alcohol during gestation in human may give raise to fetal alcohol syndrome inducing facial abnormalities, growth and mental retardation and cognitive dysfunction not compensated by development. Preclinical studies so far showed that prenatal alcohol exposure impaired spatial learning in offspring, accompanied with lower activity-dependent plasticity due to deficits in excitatory amino-acid receptor function. Thus, these deficits have been related to lower synaptic hippocampus long-term potentiation but nothing is known about long-term depression (LTD). To test this hypothesis, Sprague-Dawley dams consumed 10% ethanol solution during both gestation and lactation. Experiments were performed on dorsal hippocampal slices (400 mum thick) prepared from adolescent/peri-adolescent rats (P38-P60) from the ethanol exposed, non-ethanol exposed and pairfed group. Extracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons were performed while stimuli were delivered using a bipolar stimulating electrode placed in the stratum radiatum. LTD was induced after low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 600 bursts, 10 min) and measurements were made for 120 min following plasticity induction. In CA1 hippocampal area from adolescent rats exposed pre- and postnatally to ethanol, intrinsic excitability and glutamate release were unaltered but an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-dependent LTD was facilitated. Our results demonstrate that this was due to an increased activity of NMDA receptors during stimulation that arises from (i) a deficit in Mg2+ voltage-dependent blockade and (ii) an overexpression of NR2B NMDA-receptor subunit. We also showed that this effect of ethanol on LTD facilitation was dependent upon protein synthesis. Ongoing experiments are currently analyzing the putative involvement of GABA neurotransmission. This unexpected increased in LTD may account for some cognitive deficits after in utero ethanol exposure.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) affects 0.2Y1% of the population (Sampson et al. 1997; US Department of Health and Human Services 2005). People with this disorder may demonstrate differential behavioral responses to stressful situations (Kodituwakku 2007, Hellmans 2010). As part of a series of studies on the interaction of stress and alcohol abuse, we aimed to test the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to ethanol predisposes individuals to the development of alcohol misuse following trauma exposure. Methods Used: Female C57BL/6J mice were allowed to binge drink a 10% ethanol solution for the duration of pregnancy. Six male offspring from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) litters and six male offspring from saccharin control litters were provided access to 20% ethanol solutions according to the Drinking In the Dark model described by Rhodes et al (2005) beginning at age 45-50 days. Binge drinking before and after two cycles of withdrawal were recorded. The third withdrawal cycle was coupled with exposure of the animals to a traumatic event via predator odor exposure after which binge drinking was again assessed. Summary of Results: Both PAE and control animals demonstrated a strong alcohol deprivation effect following the first withdrawal but not following the second withdrawal. Alcohol consumption increased in both groups following the traumatic exposure with the PAE animals trending toward a greater increase in drinking after trauma than the controls; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1635). Trauma-exposed mice maintained drinking levels, which is not seen after withdrawal cycles prior to trauma. There was a significant difference between the maintenance of drinking levels following the first, second and third withdrawal (with trauma) (p<0.0001) but, again, the PAE and control groups did not significantly differ from each other. Conclusions: Exposure to a traumatic event during adolescence increases binge drinking in both control and PAE C57BL/6J male mice. PAE mice show a heightened sensitivity to trauma, as evidenced by a greater increase in drinking which may reach statistical significance with a higher powered study.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Only a minority of children with heavy alcohol exposure in utero present with complete Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), yet others may suffer serious damage. We studied children with heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol to determine the prevalence of growth restriction, abnormal facies and CNS disability. Methods Used: Of 9,628 women questioned during their first prenatal appointment in Chile, 101 who consumed at least 4 drinks/day during their pregnancy were identified (exposed). Women matched for age and parity with no alcohol consumption during pregnancy formed the unexposed group (n=105). Children in both groups were evaluated for up to 8.5 years by clinicians blinded to exposure status. Not all children had data available in all three areas; partial data were included in the analysis resulting in different denominators. Statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher's exact test. Summary of Results: Of the 72 exposed children with sufficient data in all 3 areas, 4 (5.6%) were diagnosed with FAS whereas 31 (43.1%) had no abnormalities. CNS abnormalities were detected in 44.6% (33 of 74) of the exposed compared with 14.3% (12 of 84) of the unexposed children (p < 0.01). Growth restriction was present in 27.2% (25 of 92) of the exposed and 12.5% (12 of 96) of the unexposed (p = 0.02). Facial features consistent with the FAS phenotype were present in 17.3% (14 of 81) of the exposed children compared to 1.1 % (1 of 89) of the unex-posed children (p <0.01). Conclusions: In our study impaired CNS development was the most common problem, often occurring in the absence of facial or growth abnormalities. Heavy drinking during pregnancy is a serious problem and isolated neuro developmental delay may be the only sign to alert physicians to prenatal alcohol damage.

N2  - Objective: To identify neuromorphologic and neurochemical patterns of prenatal exposure to alcohol on the developing brain of man as a risk factor for development of mental pathology in the offspring of mothers with alcoholism. Methods: We studied the brain of embryos and human fetuses at 7-12 weeks of development, which were obtained in accordance with the requirements of the Ethics Committee, in carrying out operations on abortion. There were obtained 53 embryos: 23 - from alcoholic patients and 30 women - from healthy women (control group). Age of patients was 26-39 years, disease duration - from 3 to 13 years. All cases were diagnosed with stage II alcoholism (F 10.201; F 10.202 on ICD-10). Age of women of the control group was similar to that in patients. Diagnosis established by clinical examination by co-workers of Addictive States Department of MHRI SB RAMSci. To evaluate the properties of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain of embryos sinaptoneurosomas we used the method of radio receptor binding of the selective ligand 3H-flyunitrazepame. Results: The study received previously unavailable in the scientific literature data on the ultrastructure of the developing brain in alcohol abuse among mothers during pregnancy. We were first to identify the following: damage to the cytoplasmic membrane and internal cell membrane systems, the emergence and subsequent transformation of different types of spherical formations in the perinuclear space, a variety of options of mitochondria as a normal structure, and with signs of functional and structural pathology, the increased development of the Golgi complex, the appearance of lipofuscin, multi-vesicular cells and myelin formation, delay of the development of synaptic contacts of vesicular type, manifested in decreasing the length of postsynaptic density of synaptic contacts, reducing the area and perimeter of the presynaptic terminals in the main study group, the changing nature of vascularization of the brain tissue, which was reflected in the reduction of average area of vessels, an increase in their number per unit area and reducing the perimeter of the brain. It was established that as the embryo's development properties of DAD synaptosomal membrane change that is evident in affinity receptors and an increase in their numbers. We have found that alcoholism among the mother's body leads to decrease in affinity of synaptosomal receptors of brain of embryos. This may affect the overall neurotransmitter processes in brain, and in early stages of embryo development (up to 13 weeks) fetal brain is most vulnerable to the influence of alcohol, because of the greatest sensitivity of synaptosomal receptors of brain during this period of development. Conclusion: Thus, prenatal exposure to ethanol on brain of human embryos and fetuses significantly disturbs the formation of neuronal mechanisms underlying susceptibility and information processing, which in turn can affect the mental activity of the individual.

N2  - Objective: To assess the awareness and knowledge of Lebanese pregnant women about the risks of drinking during pregnancy and the factors that influence their drinking patterns. Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on a sample of 107 women consulting the gynecology outpatient department of Hotel-Dieu de France in Beirut, Lebanon, who completed the T-ACE screening test included in a 21 multiple choice questionnaire which examine knowledge and beliefs about alcohol use during pregnancy, drinking patterns and awareness of fetal alcohol exposure. Results: The 107 women of our sample were all married, between 20 and 41 years old and had mostly a high educational level (86%). Most of the women (47%) were at their first pregnancy. Of the 20 women who self-report drinking during pregnancy, 60% have obtained a positive score on the T-ACE questionnaire, which indicates that more than 11% of the women engage with potentially high risk drinking for the baby. There is not a significant difference between the different age categories or educational levels. This proportion is lower than the one found in international publications. However, the rate of excessive drinking (4 drinks or more on any one occasion in females) was higher and 1 woman in 5 reported excessive drinking in the previous year. There is a high level of knowledge that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the child, and the more consumption the more harmful and likely the effects, but there is confusion about the safety of small amounts of alcohol. 37% of the women think that there is a safe level of drinking during pregnancy; 29% tolerate up to 1 drink a month, 9% tolerate up to 1 drink a week and one woman thinks having one drink a day is safe. Women who actually drink during pregnancy are more likely to think that alcohol consumption to a certain level is safe. 31% of the women think that beer and/or wine are safe alcohols to a certain level during pregnancy. When asked about the source of this belief, 22% mention a gynecologist but the majority (61%) says it is a personal belief. 65% of the women in our sample are aware that alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to life-long disabilities in a child, such as delayed development (36%), birth defects/deformities (35%) and mental retardation (32%). However, up to 33% of the respondents report having no information about the effects of alcohol on the fetus and 2 women believe alcohol is not harmful at all. The women in our sample seem to be more aware of the necessity to stop smoking rather than stop drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Lebanese women are not fully aware of the recommendations and risks related to drinking during pregnancy, the reason why action must be taken to insure a better diffusion of these recommendations and better assessment of alcohol intake during prenatal visits.

N2  - Introduction: High alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) associated with fetal growth restriction, facial abnormalities and neurological problems. High ethanol concentrations affect the balance of apoptosis and proliferation in term placental tissue and cell lines, but effects in the fi rst trimester, the time crucial to placental development and organogenesis, are unknown. We hypothesised that placental cell turnover and amino acid transporter function are reduced after ethanol exposure. Methods: BeWo choriocarcinoma cells (n=6) were treated for 48h Scientifi c Abstracts and fi rst trimester placental explants (n=4) for 72h with ethanol (0-40mM) then assessed for cytokeratin-18 breakdown (M30) and cell proliferation (Ki67) using immunocytochemistry. Uptake of radiolabelled methylamino isobutyric acid (14C-MeAIB) and taurine (3H-taurine) were used to quantify System A and system beta transport activity. Results: Proliferation in BeWo cells was reduced by 5% with 20mM ethanol (P<0.05; Wilcoxon-signed rank). In fi rst trimester explants, cytotrophoblast proliferation decreased by 40% at 20mM (p<0.05). Ethanol had no effect on cytokeratin-18 breakdown. System beta activity was signifi cantly reduced at 10mM and 40mM ethanol in BeWo cells (p<0.05, least square linear regression). In contrast, there was a trend towards increased taurine uptake in fi rst trimester explants at 10mM (p=0.06; Wilcoxon-signed rank) but there was no signifi cant change at 20mM (p=0.1). System A activity did not signifi cantly change after treatment in either BeWo cells or fi rst trimester explants. Conclusion: These data suggest ethanol adversely affects placental development by reducing cytotrophoblast proliferation and altering uptake of taurine at concentrations mimicking moderate to high blood alcohol levels. However, the fi rst trimester tissue response to ethanol is more complex and requires further investigation. Ethanol exposure may therefore contribute to pathologies associated with FASD either by directly affecting placental growth or by indirectly altering transport of nutrients important in organogenesis.

N2  - Prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) depends on health care providers detecting maternal risk drinking in pregnancy. The T-ACE is a valid predictor of alcohol-related negative pregnancy outcome. We recently demonstrated that increasing the total T-ACE score criterion from 2 to 3 improved selectivity, identifying more non-drinking mothers and unaffected children with little loss in detection of drinkers and affected children. In this study, African American mothers (n=3008) in a longitudinal study of prenatal alcohol and child outcomes were administered the T-ACE at their first prenatal visit. Correlations were performed to identify relations between birth outcome and standard T-ACE (total score cutpoint = 2) and a new revised screen, the T-ACER3 (total score cutpoint = 3). Chi-square analyses determined improved predictive validity. Results identified significant relations between birth weight and birth length and both the T-ACE and T-ACER3 (birth weight: T-ACE = -.06; T-ACER3 = -.11; birth length: T-ACE = -.05; T-ACER3 = -.09; all p<.001) and the key craniofacial feature of FAS, palpebral fi ssure length (T-ACE = -.04, p<.04; T-ACER3 = -.08; p<.001). While both the T-ACE and the T-ACER3 significantly predicted birth size, T-ACER3 predictive ability was significantly better than the T-ACE (birth weight: chi2=11.0, p=.001; birth length chi2=6.9, p=.009; fi ssure length: chi2=6.0, p=.014). The T-ACER3, but not the standard T-ACE, was significantly related to lower gestational age (r=-.05, p<.001) and to prior pre-term delivery (r=-.10, p<.001). Finally, the T-ACER3 alone predicted lowered neonate maturity (Neurologic: r=-.07, p<.001, Physical: r=-.05, p=.003). Increasing the total score criterion from 2 to 3 in the T-ACER3 increased the screen's ability to identify negative alcohol-related birth outcomes. The more selective in-pregnancy screening of the revised T-ACER3 over the standard T-ACE can allow for more efficient Scientific Abstracts Reproductive Sciences Vol. 18, No. 4 (Supplement), March 2011 103A antenatal screening. Improved detection of fetal risk drinking affords better opportunities for intervention to reduce or eliminate maternal drinking and thereby minimize FASDs.

N2  - Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) describes the range of effects that may occur in an individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy, which include foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcoholrelated birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Information on the FASD in Australia is limited. Data from the Western Australian Birth Defects Registry showed a birth prevalence of FAS of 0.18/1,000 live births between 1980-1997, Aboriginal children being 100 times more likely than non-Aboriginal children to be diagnosed with FAS. In Australia, a prospective national surveillance study of FAS from 2001-2004 reported a birth prevalence of FAS of 0.06/1,000 live births (n = 92 cases). These rates are much lower than those reported in countries such as the USA, France and Sweden. A survey of paediatricians in Western Australia found that only 19% correctly identified the diagnostic features of FAS, which may explain the low rates. The national surveillance reported that the median age of diagnosis was 3.26 years, 40% were living with biological parents, 51% had a sibling with FAS and 65% were indigenous. The study found that one or more behavioural problems were reported in 49% of children and 28.3% were found to have emotional problems. These findings have implications for general and mental health services.

N2  - Introduction: The physical features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) include smooth philtrum, thin vermillion border, short palpebral fissures, microcephaly, and growth deficiency on weight and height. However, little is known about the specific quantities of alcohol exposure, pattern of drinking, timing of exposure, and magnitude of risk for each of these features. Methods: Using data on 992 subjects collected prospectively in California between 1978 and 2005, we examined the patterns and timing of alcohol exposure in relation to these features. Structural features were assessed by a dysmorphologist who performed a blinded physical examination of all infants. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0-6 weeks post-conception, 6-12 weeks postconception, second trimester, and third trimester. Results: Higher prenatal alcohol exposure in every pattern was significantly associated with the incidence of smooth philtrum but not short palpebral fissures. The strongest associations were with timing of exposure in the second half of the first trimester (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14-1.36 for average number of drinks per day; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.091.26 for maximum number of drinks in one episode), whereas there was no association with third trimester alcohol consumption. Similarly, thin vermillion border was most strongly associated with exposure in the second half of the first trimester. Findings with respect to timing of exposure were similar for microcephaly and reduced birth weight. However, reduced birth length was increased with exposure in any trimester. These associations were linear and there was no evidence of a threshold. Discussion: Reduced birth length and weight, microcephaly, smooth philtrum, and thin vermillion border are associated with specific gestational timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and are dose-related without evidence of a threshold. Women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol consumption from before conception throughout.

N2  - Introduction: The umbrella term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) encompasses a continuum of clinical presentations caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), Alcohol-related Birth Defects (ARBD), and Alcohol-related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND). In the absence of characteristic facial dysmorphia, confirmation of maternal drinking is required as a diagnostic criterion for pFAS, ARBD, and ARND. Primary prevention of FASD is often problematic due to difficulties of early identification of alcohol use among pregnant women in clinical settings given the limited reliability of maternal self-report. Methods: In this talk, I will provide an overview of the existing knowledge and results from our studies on the diagnosis of FASD and confirmation of prenatal alcohol exposure. Results: Increasing evidence indicates that the majority of children adversely affected by fetal alcohol exposure do not present with birth defects. Even in the case of full-blown FAS, recognition of more subjective physical features (i.e., smooth philtrum, long philtrum, presence of a "hockey-stick" palmar crease, and palpebral fissure length) often presents a problem for general pediatricians, as shown in our data generated from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD). The CIFASD study also identified novel ultrasound measures predictive of prenatal alcohol exposure. Confirmation of fetal alcohol exposure is problematic given that the majority of children with FASD are not diagnosed until they exhibit neurodevelopmental delays in school. Even when FASD is suspected in the newborn period, accurate confirmation of maternal drinking is difficult. Currently, interest is heightened with respect to biomarkers of alcohol exposure, analysis of direct ethanol metabolites in novel media, e.g., maternal and/or newborn hair, umbilical cord, nail clippings, and dried blood spots collected during the routine newborn genetic screening. Discussion: Early and accurate diagnosis of FASD children is a strong predictive factor against secondary disabilities such as mental health problems, disrupted school experience, delinquency and incarceration, inappropriate sexual behavior, and substance abuse problems. A battery of alcohol biomarkers, in combination with other clinical measures, can provide a unique opportunity for a point-of-care identification of pregnant women and children at risk.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CNS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. To improve FASD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, much remains to be learned from basic and clinical research. Recently, application of high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; a technique that provides for accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; a method that allows CNS fiber tract reconstruction and analyses) to an FASD mouse model has proven valuable in better defining the spectrum of dysmorpholgy that results from acute ethanol exposure during early stages of prenatal development. Using these imaging methodologies both fetal and adolescent mice have been examined, with the structural alterations resulting from maternal ethanol treatment on days 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 of pregnancy being the focus of these investigations. Stage-dependent permanent CNS damage that includes deficiency of the ventromedian forebrain, hippocampus and corpus callosum has been illustrated. Additionally, cerebro-cortical and periventricular heterotopias have been identified. The functional consequences of these defects are currently being examined. MRI has also been applied to fetal mice for analyses of ethanol-induced facial dysmorphology and has allowed identification of correspondence between the character and severity of abnormalities of the upper midface and those of the brain. Establishing that the identified brain and facial changes are consistent with those in FASD and that these defects result from insult at developmental stages that are present prior to typical human pregnancy recognition strongly supports the need for pre-pregnancy counseling and education regarding alcohol consumption. With respect to such an education-based FASD prevention effort, a middle school curriculum has been developed and distributed (http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Science/curriculum.html) and a high school curriculum is currently being completed. Each of these curricula employs a hands-on science approach and emphasizes the message that maternal alcohol use even prior to the time that most pregnancies are recognized can cause serious permanent damage to the conceptus.

N2  - Objective: To identify neuromorphologic and neurochemical patterns of prenatal exposure to alcohol of developing brain of man as risk factor for development of mental pathology in offspring of mothers with alcoholism. Methods: We studied brains of embryos and fetuses (7-12 weeks). There were obtained 53 embryos: 23 - from alcoholics and 30 - from healthy women. Age of patients was 26-39 years, disease duration - from 3 to 13 years. All cases were diagnosed with stage II alcoholism (F 10.201; F 10.202). To evaluate the properties of benzodiazepine receptors in brains of embryos sinaptoneurosomas we used method of radio receptor binding of selective ligand 3H-flyunitrazepame. Results: Damage to cytoplasmic membrane and internal cell membrane systems, emergence and subsequent transformation of different types of spherical formations in perinuclear space, variety of options of mitochondria as a normal structure, and with signs of functional and structural pathology, increased development of Golgi complex, appearance of lipofuscin, multi-vesicular cells and myelin formation, delay of development of synaptic contacts of vesicular type, manifested in decreasing length of postsynaptic density of synaptic contacts, reducing area and perimeter of presynaptic terminals in main study group, changing nature of vascularization of brain tissue, what was expressed in reduction of average area of vessels, an increase in their number per unit of area and reducing perimeter of brain. Conclusion: We have found that alcoholism during pregnancy results in decrease of affinity of synaptosomal receptors of brains of embryos. This may affect overall neurotransmitter processes in brain.

N2  - The Fitzroy Valley is located ~500 km east of Broome in the remote Kim-berley region of WA, with Fitzroy Crossing town at its centre. The valley is home to ~4500 predominantly Aboriginal people belonging to 5 main language groups (Bunuba, Walmajarri/Wangkatjungka, Nyikina and Goonyandi) and living in >45 remote communities located up to 190 km from Fitzroy Crossing. In 2007, Fitzroy Valley communities were in crisis with high rates of alcohol abuse, alcohol-related harms, violence and crime. Courageous women successfully lobbied for restrictions on take-away of full strength alcohol and the subsequent health and social benefits have been well documented. Following a Women's Bush Meeting in 2008, the community identified the need to address FASD - the legacy of alcohol use in pregnancy - as a priority. In October 2008, a FASD leadership team was formed and in November 2008 they embraced a 'circle of friends' - partners in government, business and community organisations - and developed a strategy to address FASD and early life trauma. The strategy, called Marulu, includes diagnosis and prevention of FASD, community education, and support for parents and carers. Marulu is a Bunuba word meaning "precious, worth nurturing". In 2009, we were invited to help progress the strategy and conduct a FASD prevalence study called The Lililwan Project. Lililwan is a Kriol (Aboriginal English) word meaning "all the little ones". In October 2009, following extensive community consultation that confirmed this research as a priority, we formally accepted the invitation. The films Yajillarra (meaning "to dream") and Marulu will be shown and discussed. Yajillarra, which tells the story of the alcohol restrictions, was lauded when shown at the UN forum for Indigenous peoples and the Status of Women. The films were directed by Melanie Hogan, filmed by Caroline Constantine and produced by Jane Latimer.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with mental retardation and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced damage including fetal death, growth abnormalities and learning impairment in part through preventing alcohol-induced alterations in NMDA gene expressiON Given the role of cytokines and chemokines on NMDA receptors, we evaluated a panel in a model of FAS to evaluate their role and if the neuroprotective peptides NAP+SAL work through preventing these alterations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8(E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides. Embryos were harvested 24h later on gestational day 9 and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines and chemokines were measured using a microspherebased multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis,P<.05 significant. RESULTS: After 6h the chemokine KC and IL-6 levels were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median 15.7,range 10.1- 45.9pg/ml) and KC (median 45.9,range 32.5-99.1pg/ml). Embryos exposed to alcohol+NAP+SAL,had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P<.003), similar to control. Alcohol exposure resulted in elevated levels of G-CSF, treatment with NAP+SAL prevented the alcoholinduced increase (all P<.003). IL-13 and IL-1b were decreased 6h after alcohol exposure, exposure to alcohol+NAP+SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18 (10d after exposure), these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (RANTES, TNF-a, IFN-g, IL4) were not detectable at either timepoint in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL6, G-CSF and the chemokine KC which are known to affect NMDA receptors. NAP+SAL treatment prevented alcoholinduced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP+SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. We have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure decreases the expression of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT). These antioxidant enzymes are located in the brain and have promoter regions that can be genomically silenced by epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA hypermethylation. Our objective was to evaluate if the decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes in the brains of fetal mice was a function of DNA hypermethylation. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with intraperitoneal injection of saline (control) or alcohol (0.03 mL/g). Pups were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18), their brains extracted and homogenized. Each brain was analyzed individually. Real-time PCR was performed using methylation sensitive and dependent restriction enzymes to quantify methylation patterns for SOD, GPx and CAT. Data are reported as median [interquartile interval] and Mann-Whitney U was used for statistical analysis (significance: p< 0.05). RESULTS: 25 pups from 4 litters in the alcohol group and 23 pups from 5 litters in the saline group were analyzed. There was no difference in maternal or pup weight between the two groups. In utero alcohol exposure increased the percentage of DNA hypermethylation in the promoter regions of SOD compared to saline (2.89%[1.50 - 5.34] vs. 1.7%[0.79 - 2.34]; Figure. p= 0.03). No effect was seen in the GPx or CAT promoters (p = 0.94 and 0.55 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The previously characterized impaired expression of brain SOD in FAS can be due to DNA hypermethylation in the promoter region. Epigenetic modification may provide a new strategy for prevention of the long term morbidity of FAS.(Figure presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with mental retardation and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced damage in FAS including fetal death, growth abnormalities and learning impairment. Fractalkine, a chemokine constitutively expressed in neurons throughout the CNS, has a role in neuroprotection reducing neuronal death from activated microglia. Using a model of FAS we evaluated if fractalkine is altered in FAS and if the neuroprotective peptides NAP+SAL work through preventing alterations in fractalkine. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides. Embryos were harvested 24h later on gestational day 9 and 10 days later at E18. Fractalkine was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis with P P< .05 significant. RESULTS: Six hours after alcohol exposure, fractalkine levels were signficantly elevated(median 341pg/ml, range 263-424pg/ml) vs controls (median 228pg/ml, range 146-332pg/ml; P P< .001; Figure). Embryos treated with alcohol and the peptides NAP+SAL prevented the alcohol induced increase in fractalkine (median 137, range 97-255 pg/ml, P< .001). At E18 (10d after exposure), fractalkine levels were similar in all groups (medians 1821, 1852 and 2013 pg/ml respectively, P=0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in elevation of the neuroprotective chemokine fractalkine, perhaps in an effort to counter the alcohol toxicity. Treatment with the peptides NAP+SAL along with the alcohol prevents the acute increase in fractalkine.(Figure presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. Oxygen consumption in the brain results in generation of free radicals and this effect is magnified in response to alcohol. Antioxidative enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) function to prevent the cellular damage produced by free radicals. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of prenatal alcohol on antioxidant enzyme expression. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with intraperitoneal injection of saline (control) or alcohol (0.03 mL/g). Pups were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18), their brains extracted and homogenized. Each fetal brain was analyzed individually for mRNA expression of SOD, GPx and CAT using realtime PCR with 18S for internal control. Student t test was used for statistical analysis (significance: p<0.05). RESULTS: 25 pups from 4 litters in the alcohol group and 23 pups from 5 litters in the saline group were analyzed. There was no difference in maternal or pup weight between the two groups. SOD, GPx and CAT mRNA expression was significantly lower in the alcohol group compared to controls (Figure, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure inhibits SOD, GPx and CAT expression. The reduction in these antioxidant enzymes promotes an oxidant environment and contributes to the cytotoxicity associated with FAS. The antioxidant system may be a novel pathway to target for prevention of the long term morbidity of FAS. (Graff Presented).

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes wide range of behavioral and structural deficits in children, commonly known as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Children with FAS may suffer behavioral deficits in the absence of obvious malformations. In rodents, the exposure to alcohol during gestation changes brain structures and weights of offspring. The mechanism of FAS is not completely understood. In the present study, an established rat (Long-Evans) model of FAS was used. The litter size and the weights of mothers, fetuses and placentas were examined on gestation days 18 or 20. On gestation day 18, the effects of chronic alcohol on the expression levels of integrin receptor subunits, phospholipase-C and N-cadherin were examined in the fetal cerebral cortices. Presence of alcohol in the liquid-diet reduced the consumption and decreased weights of mothers and fetuses but increased the placental weights. Expression levels of (beta1 and alpha3 integrin subunits and phospholipase-C2 were significantly altered in the fetal cerebral cortices of mothers on alcohol containing diet. Results show that alcohol consumption during pregnancy even with protein, mineral and vitamin enriched diet may affect maternal and fetal health, and alter integrin receptor signaling pathways in the fetal cerebral cortex disturbing the development of fetal brains.

T1  - Intervention for individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Treatment approaches and case management
A1  - Paley B.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol in utero is considered to be the leading cause of developmental disabilities of known etiology. The most severe consequence of such exposure, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), is characterized by a distinct constellation of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation, and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Some individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) do not meet the full criteria for FAS, but instead are diagnosed with partial FAS, alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), or alcohol related birth defects (ARBD). The entire continuum of effects from PAE is increasingly being referred to under the umbrella term of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). An extensive body of research has documented major cognitive, behavioral, adaptive, social, and emotional impairments among individuals with FASDs. Although FAS was identified in the U.S. over 35 years ago, the development, evaluation, and dissemination of evidencebased interventions for individuals with FASDs have lagged behind significantly. Encouragingly, however, in recent years there has been a marked increase in efforts to design and test interventions to remediate the impairments associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This article will review treatment needs and considerations for individuals with FASDs and their families, current empirically tested treatment approaches, case management issues, and suggestions for future directions in research on the treatment of FASDs. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - The life-long neurological impairments found in people with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), including learning disabilities, impulsivity, hyperactivity, social ineptness, and poor judgment, can increase susceptibility to victimization and involvement in the criminal justice system (CJS). Individuals with FASDs become involved in the CJS as complainants, witnesses, and accused. Their disabilities, resulting from the prenatal alcohol exposure, must be considered at all stages in the legal process. Adverse experiences, such as having a dysfunctional family background, mental health problems, and substance use disorders, are compounding factors. Experiencing physical, sexual, and emotional abuse also increases the risk that these individuals will become involved in the CJS. It is critical that everyone involved in the CJS receives education and training to understand FASD and the implications for the individual offender. A comprehensive medical-legal report, prepared by professionals experienced with FASD, can help judges and lawyers understand the complex interactions among brain damage, genetics and the environment. Corrections workers and probation officers need to comprehend the significance of FASD and how it affects the offender's abilities to understand and follow rules and probation orders. Caregivers and parents need to be involved whenever possible. Early recognition of the disabilities associated with FASDs may help reduce the over-representation of this group in the CJS. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) over 35 years ago, mounting evidence about the impact of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has prompted increased attention to the link between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a constellation of developmental disabilities that are characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. These disabilities include a continuum of developmental disorders known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Longitudinal studies suggest that individuals with FASDs are at a greatly increased risk for adverse long-term outcomes, including mental health problems and poor social adjustment. This review summarizes the existing literature on mental health outcomes for individuals with PAE across the lifespan, including findings in infancy and early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence and early adulthood. Research on the psychiatric disabilities suffered by individuals with FASDs throughout development highlights the need for training of mental health professionals in the identification and the provision of specific treatments to address the unique features of this developmental disability since early identification and treatment have been demonstrated to be protective against more serious secondary disabilities. It is hoped that with greater awareness of the mental health problems experienced by individuals with FASDs, these individuals can receive appropriate and early treatment resulting in more adaptive and rewarding lives. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - The detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain include structural brain anomalies as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits. Initial neuroimaging studies of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed previous autopsy reports of overall reduction in brain volume and central nervous system (CNS) disorganization, with specific structural abnormalities of the corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate, and hippocampus. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed detection of regional increases in cortical thickness and gray matter volume along with decreased volume and disorganization of white matter in individuals with FASD. In addition, functional imaging studies have found functional and neurochemical differences in those prenatally exposed to alcohol. Behavioral alterations noted in individuals with FASD are consistent with the findings noted in the brain imaging studies. Continued neuroimaging studies are needed to further advance understanding of the neuroteratogenic effects of alcohol. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Alcohol use among women of childbearing age is a leading, preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. Although most women reduce their alcohol use upon pregnancy recognition, some women report drinking during pregnancy and others may continue to drink prior to realizing they are pregnant. These findings emphasize the need for effective prevention strategies for both pregnant and nonpregnant women who might be at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). This report reviews evidence supporting alcohol screening and brief intervention as an effective approach to reducing problem drinking and AEPs that can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. In addition, this article highlights a recent report of the National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect that describes effective interventions to reduce alcohol use and AEPs, and outlines recommendations on promoting and improving these strategies. Utilizing evidence-based alcohol screening tools and brief counseling for women at risk for an AEP and other effective population-based strategies can help achieve future alcohol-free pregnancies. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: When science, medicine, public policy, and laws collide
A1  - Warren K.R.
A1  - Hewitt B.G.
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Historically, alcohol has been used for different purposes including as a part of religious observances, as a food, at times as a medicine and its well-known use as a beverage. Until relatively recently these purposes have not changed and have at times been at odds with one another, resulting in collisions among policies and practices in science, medicine, public policy and the law. One area in which this has been particularly true is that of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) where the adverse consequences of consumed alcohol on children in the womb and after birth may have been observed since antiquity, but the actions taken based on such observations have been influenced as much by the socio/cultural/political context of the times in which they were made as by evidence of harm. This article provides an overview of the inherent confusion when new scientific findings confront prevailing medical practice, the history involved in this confusion with respect to FASD, including public policy and legal issues that have arisen around alcohol and pregnancy, and the research and clinical challenges still being faced.

N2  - Introduction: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, malformation of the fetus, diverse behavioural problems in newborns, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and learning disorder. Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted in Korea to investigate alcohol consumption and factors influencing drinking behaviour during pregnancy in Korean women. Therefore, a survey was conducted on pregnant women to investigate whether they drank alcohol and to identify factors predictive of drinking behaviour during pregnancy. Method: Pregnant women at less than 30 days before expected delivery who visited 3 obstetric and gynecology hospitals (a university hospital, a specialized hospital, and a clinic) were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire. Demographic (age, education, job, income, religion etc.) and obstetric characteristics (primipara or multipara, whether they wanted the pregnancy or not), and smoking history (cigarette smoking before and after the realization of pregnancy, frequency of smoking, average amount smoked and family history of smoking) were investigated, as were alcoholic history (consumption of alcohol before and after the realization of pregnancy, frequency of drinking, average amount consumed, and awareness that consuming alcohol during pregnancy is harmful). Results: 1) Six hundred and ninety five subjects of average age 30.8+/-3.8 years were enrolled. 2) One hundred forty one subjects visited to a university hospital, 496 subjects visited to a specialized clinic, and 58 subjects visited to a clinic. 3) Of these subjects, 25.7% had completed up to high school education and 37.6% had a job. 67.9% were primiparous, and 99.4% were aware that consuming alcohol during pregnancy is harmful. 4) Five hundred seventy eight (83.2%) and 173 subjects (24.9%), respectively, consumed alcohol before becoming pregnant and after they were aware of being pregnant. 5) Ninety seven (14.2% of 685 subjects) and 20 subjects (2.9% of 689 subjects), respectively, smoked before becoming pregnant and after they were aware of being pregnant. 6) Those that had consumed alcohol before becoming pregnant (chi2=107.21, p < 0.001, OR= 68.85), those that smoked before becoming pregnant (chi2=4.98, p = 0.025, OR=3.31) and those with a family history of smoking (chi2=8.06, p = 0.004, OR=2.29) were found to be more likely to drink alcohol when pregnant. Conclusion: This study shows that a quarter of pregnant Korean women aware of their status consume alcohol, and that 3 factors, alcohol drinking before becoming pregnant, cigarette smoking before becoming pregnant and family history of cigarette smoking, are predictive of drinking behaviour during pregnancy. These results strongly suggest that an anti-drinking educational strategy should be devised to target women of childbearing potential, in particular, those at high risk. (table presented).

N2  - The aim of the present work was to address the effects of prenatal alcohol intoxication on morphometric measures of developing vessels in the human embryonic and fetal cerebrum. Materials and Methods: Embryos and fetuses at weeks 7-12 of development were obtained during terminations of pregnancy in accord with the requirements of the Ethics Committee and with patients' consent; 23 were from alcoholic women (the experimental group) and 30 were from healthy women (the control group). All cases had stage II alcoholism (ICD F10.201 and F10.202). Electron microscopic studies addressed the intermediate layer of the forebrain. Computer morphometry was performed using sections at the level of the intermediate layer stained with methylene blue. We used Scion for Windows program to determine mean vascular cross-sectional area, the relative cross-sectional area of vessels, number of vessels per unit area, and the perimeter of vessels; measurements were made in the control group and the experimental group. Numerical data were analyzed using a parametric method of variation statistics using Student's test; differences were regarded as significant at p < 0.05. Results: At weeks 8-9 of development in normal conditions and in the presence of prenatal exposure to alcohol, vessels in the forming brain consisted only of capillaries with thin walls. Analysis of brain sections from fetuses of the experimental group at 10 weeks of development revealed erythrocyte stasis in some forming vessels. Our data show that from 10 weeks of development, vessels in the human brain start to differentiate into arteries and veins. At week 12 of development, capillary basal membranes in the control and experimental groups were already clearly visible. In both cases, the apical surfaces of endotheliocytes remained smooth, with only occasional microvilli and no significant protrusions of these cells into lumens, which remained open. Quantitative computer morphometric studies established a series of characteristics distinguishing brain tissues developing in conditions of prenatal exposure to alcohol from that developing in controls. Mean vessel cross-sectional areas and vessel perimeters in the experimental group were significantly reduced at week 11 as compared with controls. The tendency for these measures to decrease in the experimental group compared with controls persisted at 12 weeks of development. Relative vessel crosssectional area in brain tissue from the experimental group was greater than in controls. This measure was significantly greater in this group at weeks 11 and 12 of development. The number of vessels per unit area in the experimental group was significantly increased at weeks 11 and 12 of fetal brain development as compared with controls. Thus, maternal alcoholization during pregnancy can have significant influences on the dynamics of the human embryonic and fetal development of the cerebral circulatory system, which is apparent mainly as changes in the vascularization of the growing brain.

N2  - We explored differences in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors across six groups of professionals in key position to provide primary and secondary prevention efforts (physicians, educators, correctional staff, social workers, public health nurses, and substance abuse counselors). Achieving a 60.1% response rate, 2,292 professionals returned surveys, providing data on basic knowledge of FAS, FASD-associated risks and cognitive deficits, and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women. Across groups, findings revealed ample FASD knowledge and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women that increases as consumption becomes more frequent and severe. However, results revealed significant between-group differences data that provide valuable guidance for targeted future FASD education efforts. Public health initiatives regarding FASD have been effective in increasing knowledge among a broad range of professionals. However, between-group differences indicate the need for targeted, discipline-specific interventions. These differences highlight the need for all professional groups to provide a consistent public health message regarding maternal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Consumption of 8 alcoholic drinks per week or 5 alcoholic drinks on one occasion by a pregnant woman can affect the developing fetus. However, it can be difficult to determine which patients are at risk. To evaluate how well the answer to a single question about binge drinking could help identify women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). Using data from a study of methods to prevent AEPs, the authors compared the efficacy of self-reported answers to a screening question about binge drinking (5 or more standard drinks on one occasion) within the past 90 days with answers to a question about drinking quantity (weekly consumption of 8 or more standard drinks) within the past 90 days. The participants were 354 women of childbearing age who met screening criteria for being at risk of an AEP. The binge question was answered positively by 346 women (97.7%) at risk, while only 209 women (59.0%) reported that they drank 8 or more drinks in a week. A single question about binge drinking can effectively and quickly identify the majority of women at risk of an AEP.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can alter physical and behavioral development, leading to a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Despite warning labels, pregnant women continue to drink alcohol, creating a need to identify effective interventions to reduce the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects. Choline is an essential nutrient that influences brain and behavioral development. Recent studies indicate that choline supplementation can reduce the teratogenic effects of developmental alcohol exposure. The present study examined whether choline supplementation during prenatal ethanol treatment could mitigate the adverse effects of ethanol on behavioral development. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated with 6 g/kg/day ethanol in a binge-like manner from gestational days 5-20; pair-fed and ad libitum chow controls were included. During treatment, subjects from each group were intubated with either 250 mg/kg/day choline chloride or vehicle. Spontaneous alternation, parallel bar motor coordination, Morris water maze, and spatial working memory were assessed in male and female offspring. Subjects prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibited delayed development of spontaneous alternation behavior and deficits on the working memory version of the Morris water maze during adulthood, effects that were mitigated with prenatal choline supplementation. Neither alcohol nor choline influenced performance on the motor coordination task. These data indicate that choline supplementation during prenatal alcohol exposure may reduce the severity of fetal alcohol effects, particularly on alterations in tasks that require behavioral flexibility. These findings have important implications for children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Conflicting findings exist regarding the risks of low to moderate levels of alcohol use during pregnancy. A recent study from Australia has suggested that mild gestational drinking is not associated with adverse fetal effects, and may even be associated with favorable outcomes as compared to "no drinking".The study may lead women to continue consuming alcohol throughout pregnancy, despite methodological limitations that render its conclusions uncertain. This review discusses the challenges of assessing long-term effects of moderate drinking during pregnancy. Recommendations are provided for researchers investigating the effects of prenatal alcohol consumption on subsequent developmental outcomes in children.

N2  - In Argentina, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is an almost neglected condition as an important etiological factor for the induction of a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases that may appear during childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Children born to alcoholic mothers may show a spectrum of diseases ranging from an apparent normality to a profound mental retardation, passing through epilepsy, attention deficit disorders with or without hyperactivity, autism and pervasive developmental disorders, and different types of learning disorders. When adolescents, they may develop different kinds of personality disorders and substance abuse disorders. Finally, in adulthood, they may suffer from different types of affective and psychotic disorders, among others. A great number of those children may not develop their full mental and social potentiality as free individuals. They usually have diverse types of cognitive, attentional, mnemonic and affective impairments. Not infrequently, they engage in antisocial behaviors, have school or work troubles. In this work, I review the present clinical classifications of the disorders emerging from a PAE and the several neuropsychiatric diseases that can be induced by them, in order to call attention to the Argentinian neuropsychiatric community about the increasingly, although underdiagnosed, frequency of these disorders in our country.

N2  - Alcohol exposure in pregnancy is a common and modifiable risk factor for poor pregnancy and child outcomes. Alcohol exposure in pregnancy can cause a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems in the child including the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). In order to improve prevention strategies, we sought to describe the knowledge and attitudes of women of childbearing age regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus. We conducted a national cross-sectional survey via computer assisted telephone interview of 1103 Australian women aged 18 to 45 years. Participants were randomly selected from the Electronic White Pages. Pregnant women were not eligible to participate. Quotas were set for age groups and a minimum of 100 participants per state to ensure a national sample reflecting the population. The questionnaire was based on a Health Canada survey with additional questions constructed by the investigators. Descriptive statistics were calculated and logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations with participants' knowledge and attitudes. Of women surveyed, 61.5% had heard about effects of alcohol on the fetus and 55.3% had heard of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Although 92.7% agreed alcohol can affect the unborn child, 16.2% did not agree that the disabilities could be lifelong. Most women agreed that pregnant women should not drink alcohol (80.2%) and 79.2% reported having negative feelings towards pregnant women drinking alcohol. Women with higher education levels were more likely to know the effects of alcohol consumption in pregnancy (adjusted OR 5.62; 95% CI 3.20 to 9.87) but education level and knowledge were not associated with attitude. There was a disjunction between knowledge and attitudes towards alcohol consumption in pregnancy. These findings will assist in developing effective health promotion campaigns to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and subsequent fetal damage.

N2  - Psychological distress (PD) includes symptoms of depression and anxiety and is associated with considerable emotional suffering, social dysfunction and, often, with problematic alcohol use. The rate of current PD among American Indian women is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of U.S. women in general. Our study aims to fill the current knowledge gap about the prevalence and characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems among American Indian mothers whose children were referred to screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data was conducted from maternal interviews of referred American Indian mothers (n = 152) and a comparison group of mothers (n = 33) from the same Plains culture tribes who participated in an NIAAA-funded epidemiology study of FASD. Referred women were from one of six Plains Indian reservation communities and one urban area who bore children suspected of having an FASD. A 6-item PD scale (PD-6, Cronbach's alpha = .86) was constructed with a summed score range of 0-12 and a cut-point of 7 indicating serious PD. Multiple statistical tests were used to examine the characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems. Referred and comparison mothers had an average age of 31.3 years but differed (respectively) on: education (<high school: 47.4%, 9.1%), PD-6 mean scores (3.57, 1.48), current prevalence of serious PD (19.1%, 0.0%), and a current drinking problem (31.6%, 12.1%). Among referred mothers, those with a current drinking problem had a significantly higher mean PD-6 score. Having PD, serious PD, and 2 specific scale items significantly increased the odds that a referred mother would have a current drinking problem. Psychological distress among referred mothers is significantly associated with having a self-reported drinking problem. FASD prevention requires multi-level prevention efforts that provide real opportunities for educational attainment and screening and monitoring of PD and alcohol use during the childbearing years. Mixed methods studies are needed to illuminate the social and cultural determinants at the base of the experience of PD and to identify the strengths and protective factors of unaffected peers who reside within the same communities.

N2  - In the last 40 years a vast mass of clinical, epidemiological and experimental evidence has demonstrated that alcohol is a teratogenic agent and that its consumption during gestation can cause foetal death, malformations and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in the exposed fetus. The most dramatic presentation is the complete foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is observed in children born from heavy alcohol consuming mothers. FAS and of other fetal alcohol-related effects was reported in both USA and Europe in the middle 80 s. However, despite these evidences, many European countries have largely forgotten or minimize the risks associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. Thirty years later, new epidemiological and clinical studies as well as new biomarkers of fetal-alcohol damage have identified high risk populations and have provided data demonstrating that significant number of women in the EU drink during pregnancy. In September of 2009, a conference on 'ALCOHOL AND PREGNANCY' was organized sponsored by the Swedish Presidency of the European Union, to discuss political interventions in the EU concerning this question. I briefly summarize here the discussions, presentations and the prevention programs of some European countries. The main conclusion of the conference was that we need more information and prevention programs to improve prevention of the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption during gestation.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the educational effects of a single leaflet distributed once without explanation of its content. METHODS: All the 58 seniors on a dietitian course and all the 81 students who took "health and nutrition" as their elective in a women's university in F Prefecture were recruited. They were assigned to intervention or control groups. Both groups were asked the following choice questions in a baseline survey: "What do you think about alcohol drinking during pregnancy?" "What do you suppose you yourself will do in the future?" and "Do you know about the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)?" One month later, a leaflet was distributed to the intervention group only. One week after the distribution, a second questionnaire was administered to both groups. The leaflet and the two questionnaires were distributed and collected during class with the help of teaching staff. The leaflet was made by a NPO and it recommended stopping drinking when planning to become pregnant. RESULTS: The participation rate was 83%. There were no significant associations between groups and grades, current drinking habit, and learning experience on this topic. Almost 80% of the intervention group read the leaflet. Change in their thinking about drinking during pregnancy before and after the intervention did not significantly differ between the two groups. Compared to 57 controls, 66 students who received the leaflet showed significant improved changes in their attitudes toward drinking during pregnancy and the knowledge about FAS. CONCLUSIONS: No significant change in their thinking about drinking during pregnancy could be due to the fact that, even before the intervention, nearly 80% of the students thought pregnant women must abstain from alcohol entirely. This might be related to the sample characteristics, since 75% of them were majoring in nutrition. The improvement in attitudes was considered to reflect the content of the leaflet. In the intervention group, the percentage of the students who chose the alternative of "I plan to stop drinking when I wish to get pregnant" increased as the leaflet recommended and more than half of them said they learned about FAS by this leaflet. To sum up, even a single distribution of a leaflet in a school setting had educational effects which improved attitude and knowledge. Since the current sample seemed to have particular knowledge and interest in health, it is now necessary to examine effects of the same approach in the general population.

N2  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) were determined in 602 meconium samples in a maternal health evaluation study for detection of gestational alcohol consumption. A validated headspace solid phase microextraction method in combination with GC-MS was used for FAEE and the cumulative concentration of ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate with a cut-off of 500 ng/g was applied for interpretation. A new and simple method was developed and validated for quantification of EtG from 10-20 mg meconium with D 5-EtG as internal standard consisting of 30 min. extraction with methanol/water (1:1, v/v), evaporation of methanol, filtration of the aqueous solution through a cellulose filter and injection into LC-MS-MS. The limits of detection and quantification for EtG were 10 and 30 ng/g, the recovery 86.6 to 106.4% and the standard deviation of the concentrations ranged from 13% at 37 ng/g to 5% at 46,700 ng/g (N = 6). FAEE above the cut-off were found in 43 cases (7.1%) with cumulative concentrations between 507 and 22,580 ng/g and with one outlier of about 150,000 ng/g (EtG not detected). EtG was detected in 97 cases (16.3%) and concentrations between LOD and 10,200 ng/g with another outlier of 82,000 ng/g (FAEE 10,500 ng/g). Optimal agreement between the two markers was obtained with a cut-off for EtG of 274 ng/g and 547 cases with both FAEE- and EtG-negative, 33 cases with both FAEE- and EtG-positive, nine cases with FAEE-positive and EtG-negative, and seven cases with FAEE-negative and EtG-positive. Differences in physical, chemical, and biochemical properties and in the pharmacokinetic behavior are discussed as reasons for the deviating cases. In none of the 602 cases, serious alcohol consumption was reported by the mothers and no evidence for gestational ethanol exposure was observed in the medical investigation of the newborns. It is concluded that the combined use of FAEE and EtG in meconium as markers for fetal alcohol exposure essentially increases the accuracy of the interpretation and helps to avoid false positive and false-negative results. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure triggers ceramide-induced apoptosis in neural crest-derived tissues concurrent with defective cranial development
A1  - Wang G.
A1  - Bieberich E.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The reason why specific embryonic tissues are sensitive toward ethanol is not understood. We found that in neural crest-derived cell (NCC) cultures from the first branchial arch of E10 mouse embryos, incubation with ethanol increases the number of apoptotic cells by fivefold. Apoptotic cells stain intensely for ceramide, suggesting that ceramide-induced apoptosis mediates ethanol damage to NCCs. Apoptosis is reduced by incubation with CDP-choline (citicoline), a precursor for the conversion of ceramide to sphingomyelin. Consistent with NCC cultures, ethanol intubation of pregnant mice results in ceramide elevation and increased apoptosis of NCCs in vivo. Ethanol also increases the protein level of prostate apoptosis response 4 (PAR-4), a sensitizer to ceramide-induced apoptosis. Prenatal ethanol exposure is concurrent with malformation of parietal bones in 20% of embryos at day E18. Meninges, a tissue complex derived from NCCs, is disrupted and generates reduced levels of TGF-beta1, a growth factor critical for bone and brain development. Ethanol-induced apoptosis of NCCs leading to defects in the meninges may explain the simultaneous presence of cranial bone malformation and cognitive retardation in FAS. In addition, our data suggest that treatment with CDP-choline may alleviate the tissue damage caused by alcohol. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

T1  - Bringing morphometrics into the fetal alcohol report: Statistical language for the forensic neurologist or psychiatrist
A1  - Bookstein F.L.
A1  - Kowell A.P.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The components of a diagnosis in the fetal alcohol spectrum consider, among other domains, evidence of prenatal alcohol exposure, facial features, neurological or neuropsychological deficits, and neuroanatomical form. Most of these assessments are based on traditional sorts of quantifications (e.g., length measures, IQ scores, quantity of alcohol drunk by the mother), but for one of the domains, the morphometric assessment of neuroanatomical form as abnormal in a way suggesting fetal alcohol damage, the associated quantifications are relatively recent. For purposes of a forensic report, this morphometric component of the diagnostic judgment would seem to go best in the form of one classic statistical quantity, the likelihood ratio (odds ratio) of two hypotheses as they both attempt to explain the form of a particular structure within the defendant's brain (in our approach, the midcurve of the corpus callosum). On one hypothesis, the subject is presumed to be from a normal population; on the other, he is from a group all characterized by diagnosable fetal alcohol damage. Our article explains in simple terms how the forensic physician might wish to couch that component of the FASD diagnostic system for the purpose of aiding those in the courtroom who have the task of determining guilt or culpability. © 2011 by Federal Legal Publications, Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is the most severe consequence of alcohol on the fetus in the prenatal period, has been described in the French medical literature by Lemoine in 1968. Five years later, Jones and his colleagues were the first researchers to show a link between alcohol abuse by pregnant women and specific characteristics of birth defects. This work formed a basis for further research to identify diagnostic criteria. Since that time, several proposals for diagnosis have been developed, aimed at an accurate survey of a wide range of physical and behavioural anomalies resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol. The diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a real challenge. Patients after prenatal exposure to alcohol exhibit a wide range of symptoms, most of which are not specific only for prenatal intoxication and often manifest themselves in various ways throughout life. In Poland the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is sporadic and because of the lack of access to objective diagnostic tools and professional literature in Polish the diagnosis is based on the investigator's subjective assessment and the diagnoses issued in different centres may differ. As a result, many people with FASD live without a correct diagnosis or as a result of misdiagnosis (e.g. autism, ADHD, behavioural disorders, etc.) they receive improper treatment. The purpose of this publication is to present the development of diagnostic methods in the world and in Poland with particular emphasis on 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. © 2010 by Medical Communications.

N2  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are birth defects directly linked to consumption of alcohol during pregnancy and hence completely preventable. Many health and allied health professionals are in prime positions for primary prevention of FASDs through work with women of childbearing age and secondary prevention through work with affected individuals whose lives can be greatly improved via tailored intervention. Objectives To develop educational guidelines for FASD prevention. Methods Interviews were conducted with 26 individuals representing eight health or allied health professions. Participants were asked about professional groups with which they had sufficient experience to describe FASD-related competencies and educational needs for the given group(s). For each group, participants were asked for their perceptions of group members' FASD awareness, knowledge, and skills application as related to the seven core competencies for FASD practice developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results Findings revealed that competence, especially when viewed separately in terms of knowledge versus capacity for application of information, in the area of FASDs is unevenly distributed among and throughout healthcare provider groups. Conclusion Based on this information, recommendations are offered for optimal health and allied health education efforts to prevent and treat FASDs, framed along FASD core competencies recommended by the CDC. ©2010 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

T1  - Paternal genetic contribution influences fetal vulnerability to maternal alcohol consumption in a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
A1  - Sittig L.J.
A1  - Redei E.E.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol exposure causes in the offspring a collection of permanent physiological and neuropsychological deficits collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The timing and amount of exposure cannot fully explain the substantial variability among affected individuals, pointing to genetic influences that mediate fetal vulnerability. However, the aspects of vulnerability that depend on the mother, the father, or both, are not known. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) and inbred Brown Norway (BN) rat strains as well as their reciprocal crosses, we administered ethanol (E), pair-fed (PF), or control (C) diets to the pregnant dams. The dams' plasma levels of free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), free T3 (fT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured to elucidate potential differences in maternal thyroid hormonal environment, which affects specific aspects of FASD. We then compared alcohol-exposed, pair fed, and control offspring of each fetal strain on gestational day 21 (G21) to identify maternal and paternal genetic effects on bodyweight and placental weight of male and female fetuses. Conclusions: SD and BN dams exhibited different baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function. Moreover, the thyroid function of SD dams was more severely affected by alcohol consumption while that of BN dams was relatively resistant. This novel finding suggests that genetic differences in maternal thyroid function are one source of maternal genetic effects on fetal vulnerability to FASD. The fetal vulnerability to decreased bodyweight after alcohol exposure depended on the genetic contribution of both parents, not only maternal contribution as previously thought. In contrast, the effect of maternal alcohol consumption on placental weight was consistent and not strain-dependent. Interestingly, placental weight in fetuses with different paternal genetic contributions exhibited opposite responses to caloric restriction (pair feeding). In summary, these novel findings demonstrate both maternal and paternal genetic contributions to in utero vulnerability to alcohol, refining our understanding of the genetically-based heterogeneity seen in human FASD. © 2010 Sittig, Redei.

N2  - Background: To examine whether maternal alcohol intake, including binge drinking (intake 5 drinks, equivalent to 60 g pure ethanol on a single occasion), is associated with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and infantile autism. Methods: Participants were 80 552 children and their mothers enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort from 1996 to 2002. Alcohol consumption was obtained by self-report during pregnancy. Information on ASD was obtained from the Danish Central Psychiatry Register. Follow-up ended on February 2008. Data were analysed by means of Cox regression. Results: In total, 401 children were diagnosed with ASD and 157 with infantile autism. No association was found between average alcohol consumption and ASD or infantile autism, respectively. For binge drinking, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for ASD was 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-0.97] among women who binge drank once during pregnancy compared with women who did not binge drink. The corresponding HR for infantile autism was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.36-1.02). However, the HR for ASD was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.51-1.36) when restricting the analysis to first-time pregnancies conceived within 6 months of trying. No estimate was made for infantile autism due to low number of cases. No association was seen for more than one binge episode and for the timing of binge drinking. Conclusion: Our findings do not support that a low prenatal alcohol exposure increases the risk of ASD or infantile autism. The lower risk for women who binge drank once during pregnancy is most likely non-causal. © The Author 2010; Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association.

A1  - Vangipuram S.D.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Prenatal ethanol (ETOH) exposure can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We previously showed that ETOH alters cell adhesion molecule gene expression and increases neurosphere size in fetal brain-derived neural stem cells (NSC). Here, our aim was to determine the effect of ETOH on the cell fate of NSC, premature glial-committed precursor cells (GCP), and premature neuron-committed progenitor cells (NCP). Methods: NSC, GCP, and NCP were isolated from normal second-trimester fetal human brains (n = 3) by positive selection using magnetic microbeads labeled with antibodies to CD133 (NSC), A2B5 (GCP), or PSA-NCAM (NCP). As a result of the small percentage in each brain, NSC were cultured in mitogenic media for 72 hours to produce neurospheres. The neurospheres from NSC and primary isolates of GCP and NCP were used for all experiments. Equal numbers of the 3 cell types were treated either with mitogenic media or with differentiating media, each containing 0 or 100 mM ETOH, for 120 hours. Expression of Map2a, GFAP, and O4 was determined by immunoflourescence microscopy and western blot analysis. Fluorescence intensities were quantified using Metamorph software by Molecular Devices, and the bands of western blots were quantified using densitometry. Results: ETOH in mitogenic media promoted formation of neurospheres by NSC, GCP, and NCP. Under control conditions, GCP attached and differentiated, NSC and NCP formed neurospheres that were significantly smaller in size than those in ETOH. Under differentiating conditions, Map2a expression increased significantly in NSC and GCP and reduced significantly in NCP, and GFAP expression reduced significantly in GCP and NCP, and Gal-C expression reduced significantly in all 3 cell types in the presence of ETOH compared to controls. Conclusions: This study shows that ETOH alters the cell fate of neuronal stem and progenitor cells. These alterations could contribute to the mechanism for the abnormal brain development in FASD. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: A primary goal of recent research is the development of neurobehavioral profiles that specifically define fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which may assist differential diagnosis or improve treatment. In the current study, we define a preliminary profile using neuropsychological data from a multisite study. Methods: Data were collected using a broad neurobehavioral protocol from 2 sites of a multisite study of FASD. Subjects were children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and unexposed controls. The alcohol-exposed group included children with and without fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). From 547 neuropsychological variables, 22 variables were selected for analysis based on their ability to distinguish children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls. These data were analyzed using latent profile analysis (LPA). Results: The results indicated that a 2-class model best fit the data. The resulting profile was successful at distinguishing subjects with FAS from nonexposed controls without FAS with 92% overall accuracy; 87.8% of FAS cases and 95.7% of controls were correctly classified. The same analysis was repeated with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure but without FAS and nonexposed controls with similar results. The overall accuracy was 84.7%; 68.4% of alcohol-exposed cases and 95% of controls were correctly classified. In both analyses, the profile based on neuropsychological variables was more successful at distinguishing the groups than was IQ alone. Conclusions: We used data from 2 sites of a multisite study and a broad neuropsychological test battery to determine a profile that could be used to accurately identify children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Results indicated that measures of executive function and spatial processing are especially sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Concurrent alcohol exposure has been associated with reduced fecundity, but no studies have estimated the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on male fecundity. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, semen quality and levels of reproductive hormones in young, adult men. Methods: From a Danish pregnancy cohort established in 1984-1987, 347 sons were selected for a follow-up study conducted in 2005-2006. Semen and blood samples were analyzed for conventional semen characteristics and reproductive hormones, respectively, and results were related to prospectively self-reported information on maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results:The sperm concentration decreased with increasing prenatal alcohol exposure. The adjusted mean sperm concentration among sons of mothers drinking >4.5 drinks per week during pregnancy was 40 (95 CI: 25-60) millions/ml. This concentration was ~32 lower compared with men exposed to <1.0 drink per week, who had a sperm concentration of 59 (95 CI: 44-77) millions/ml. The semen volume and the total sperm count were also associated with prenatal alcohol exposure; sons prenatally exposed to 1.0-1.5 drinks per week had the highest values. No associations were found for sperm motility, sperm morphology or any of the reproductive hormones, including testosterone. Conclusions: These results indicate that prenatal exposure to alcohol may have a persisting adverse effect on Sertoli cells, and thereby sperm concentration. If these associations are causal they could explain some of the reported differences between populations and long-term changes in semen quality. © 2010 The Author.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can seriously harm the fetus, dependent on time, duration and frequency of exposure. The variety of outcomes is subsumed under the term >>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders<< (FASD). Diagnostic classification by means of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code results from the occurence of four key characteristics: Growth retardation, facial anomalies, CNS abnormalities (microcephaly, mental retardation, functional problems and behavioral problems) and prenatal alcohol exposure. As the facial characteristics are often discrete, the focus lies on the behavioral problems. Foster parents (most of the affected children do not stay with their biological parents) are overstrained by the everyday life with their alcohol affected children. An early diagnosis is necessary to release the foster families and to develop an appropriate concept for supporting the children according to their capabilities. Therefore a supportive network of attending pediatricians, >>Sozialpadiatrische Zentren<<, therapists and youth welfare offices with specific support for foster parents. This network aims at avoiding the adverse development and the multiple punishment of the affected children by brain dysfunction, postnatal traumatic experiences in the birth families and the danger of anew breakups of relationships due to the serious behavioral problems. Regarding pregnancy care there has to be a paradigm shift in sense of an alcohol abstinence imperative during pregnancy and early identification and treatment of (potentially) alcohol consuming pregnant women. Gynaecologists, midwives and addiction therapists are to be involved. The allover admission of alcohol consuming pregnant women respective of the later mother and child into this network is an essential. It's challenge to the whole society both to enact a specific FASD-prevention law and to establish mandatory guidelines.

N2  - Background: Number processing deficits are frequently seen in children exposed to alcohol in utero. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the neural correlates of number processing in 15 right-handed, 8- to 12-year-old children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS) and 18 right-handed, age- and gender-matched controls from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, using Proximity Judgment and Exact Addition tasks. Results: Control children activated the expected fronto-parietal network during both tasks, including the anterior horizontal intraparietal sulcus (HIPS), left posterior HIPS, left precentral sulcus, and posterior medial frontal cortex. By contrast, on the Proximity Judgment task, the exposed children recruited additional parietal pathways involving the right and left angular gyrus and posterior cingulate/precuneus, which may entail verbally mediated recitation of numbers and/or subtraction to assess relative numerical distances. During Exact Addition, the exposed children exhibited more diffuse and widespread activations, including the cerebellar vermis and cortex, which have been found to be activated in adults engaged in particularly challenging number processing problems. Conclusions: The data suggest that, whereas control children rely primarily on the fronto-parietal network identified in previous studies to mediate number processing, children with FAS/PFAS recruit a broader range of brain regions to perform these relatively simple number processing tasks. Our results are consistent with structural neuroimaging findings indicating that the parietal lobe is relatively more affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and provide the first evidence for brain activation abnormalities during number processing in children with FAS/PFAS, effects that persist even after controlling statistically for group differences in total intracranial volume and IQ.

N2  - Objective To examine the association of fetal alcohol exposure during pregnancy with child and adolescent behavioural development. Design The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study recruited 2900 pregnancies (1989-91) and the 14-year follow up was conducted between 2003 and 2006. Setting Tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth, Western Australia. Population The women in the study provided data at 18 and 34 weeks of gestation on weekly alcohol intake: no drinking, occasional drinking (up to one standard drink per week), light drinking (2-6 standard drinks per week), moderate drinking (7-10 standard drinks per week), and heavy drinking (11 or more standard drinks per week). Methods Longitudinal regression models were used to analyse the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) scores over 14 years, assessed by continuous z-scores and clinical cutoff points, after adjusting for confounders. Main outcome measure Their children were followed up at ages 2, 5, 8, 10 and 14 years. The CBCL was used to measure child behaviour. Results Light drinking and moderate drinking in the first 3 months of pregnancy were associated with child CBCL z-scores indicative of positive behaviour over 14 years after adjusting for maternal and sociodemographic characteristics. These changes in z-score indicated a clinically meaningful reduction in total, internalising and externalising behavioural problems across the 14 years of follow up. Conclusions Our findings do not implicate light-moderate consumption of alcohol in pregnancy as a risk factor in the epidemiology of child behavioural problems. © RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

N2  - Aims: To study the long-term changes of dendritic spine and synapse taking place in a mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Methods: Pregnant mice were intubated daily with ethanol (EtOH) from E5 to parturition. A DiI diolistic method was used to label dendritic spines of pyramidal cells in the visual cortex of EtOH-exposed and control pups over the period from postnatal (P) day P0 to P30; synaptic ultrastructure was also analyzed using transmission electron microscopy. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with a significant decrease in the number of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex and an increase in their mean length. The changes were dose dependent and persisted to P30. Ultrastructural changes were also observed, with decreased numbers of synaptic vesicles, narrowing of the synaptic cleft and thickening of the postsynaptic density compared to controls; ultrastructural changes also persisted to P30. Conclusions: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with longterm changes in dendritic spines and synaptic ultrastructure; these alterations probably reflect the developmental retardation of dendritic spines and synapses in visual cortex. These long-term changes are likely to contribute to lifelong mental retardation associated with childhood FASDs. © The Author 2010.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can have detrimental effects on a child's development of adaptive behaviors necessary for success in the areas of academic achievement, socialization, and self-care. Sensory processing abilities have been found to affect a child's ability to successfully perform adaptive behaviors. The current study explored whether significant differences in sensory processing abilities, adaptive behavior, and neurocognitive functioning are observed between children diagnosed with partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND), or children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol (PEA), but did not meet criteria for an FASD diagnosis. The influence of IQ on adaptive behavior as well as further exploration of the relationship between sensory processing and adaptive behavior deficits among these children was also examined. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted on some of the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) scores, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System - Second Edition (ABAS-II) scores, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition/Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Third Edition (WISC- IV/WPPSI - III) scores of 46 children between 3 and 14 years of age with pFAS, ARND, or who were PEA. Results: Greater sensory processing deficits were found in children with a diagnosis of pFAS and ARND compared to those in the PEA group. Children with an ARND diagnosis scored significantly worse on measures of adaptive behavior than the PEA group. Children with pFAS scored significantly lower than children with ARND or PEA on perceptual/performance IQ. No correlation was found between IQ scores and adaptive behaviors across the FASD diagnostic categories. A significant positive correlation was found between SSP and ABAS-II scores. Conclusions: Regardless of the diagnosis received under the FASD umbrella, functional difficulties that could not be observed using traditional measures of intelligence were found, supporting guidelines that a broad range of standardized assessments be included when screening children for FASD. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are sensitive and specific biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in pregnancy. We recently reported a 2.5% rate of FAEE positive meconium in a general population sample of infants born in the region of Grey-Bruce, Ontario. Women in this region with high-risk pregnancies are transferred to a tertiary care facility in London, Ontario. The objective of this study was to determine, in a population-based sample, whether high-risk pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of in utero alcohol exposure. Grey-Bruce residents transferred to the high-risk obstetric unit of St. Joseph's Health Care in London, Ontario were identified and consented to this anonymous prevalence study. Meconium was collected and analyzed for FAEE using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. The prevalence of FAEE positive meconium was compared with the population-based prevalence in the Grey-Bruce. Fifty meconium specimens were collected from August 1, 2006 to July 31, 2007. Fifteen (30%) specimens tested positive for FAEE. The results indicate that infants born in the high-risk obstetric unit had a 12-fold higher risk of screening positive for second and third trimester alcohol exposure compared with infants born in the general population of Grey-Bruce (relative risk = 12.04, 95% confidence interval = 6.40-22.65, Pandlt; .0001). These results suggest that the high-risk pregnancies should be screened for PAE and followed-up for potential diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. andcopy; 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to a wide range of adverse effects on a developing fetus. As a whole, these teratogenic outcomes are generally known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, the most severe of which is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Clinically, children diagnosed with FAS vary greatly in their presentation of symptoms, likely due to the amount of alcohol and timing of exposure, as well as maternal and genetic influences. All these factors play a role in determining the mechanisms through which alcohol damages a developing brain, the details of which are still largely unknown. However, continuing research and recent developments have provided promising results that may lead to screening mechanisms and treatment therapies for children with FAS. Here we review the teratogenic effects of alcohol, strategies for detecting maternal alcohol consumption, identification of fetal biological markers, and prevention methods for FAS. © 2010 S.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which includes a range of developmental deficits. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most severe form of FASD and can be diagnosed with pathognomonic facial features such as a smooth philtrum, short palpebral fissure, and thin upper vermilion. However, many children with developmental damage because of prenatal alcohol exposure exhibit none, or only a subset, of the above features, making diagnosis difficult. This study explored novel analyses to quantify the effect of a known dose of alcohol on specific facial measurements in substrains C57BL/B6J (B6J) and C57BL/6NHsd (B6N) mice. Mouse dams were provided alcohol (Alc) consisting of 4.8% (vol/vol) alcohol in a liquid diet for 16 days prepregnancy and chow and water diet during mating, and then the alcohol liquid diet was reinstated on gestational days 7 (E7) to gestational day 17 (E17). Treatment controls included a pair-fed (PF) group given matched volumes of an alcohol-free liquid diet made isocalorically and a group given ad lib access to lab chow and water (Chow). Maternal diet intake (Alc and PF), blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), embryo weights, and 15 morphometric facial measurements for E17 embryos were analyzed. B6N dams drank more alcohol during pregnancy and generated higher BAC than B6J dams. Both the Alc and PF treatments induced significant reductions in embryo weights relative to Chow in both substrains. Alcohol treatments produced significant changes, relative to controls, in 4 of the 15 facial measures for the B6N substrain but only in two measures for the B6J substrain. Discriminant analysis demonstrated successful classification of the alcohol-exposed versus nonalcohol-exposed B6N embryos, with a high sensitivity of 86%, specificity 80%, and overall classification (total correct 83%), whereas B6J mice yielded sensitivity of 80%, specificity 78%, and overall correct classification in 79%. In addition, B6N mice showed significantly more effects of pair feeding on these facial measures than did B6J mice, suggesting that the B6N substrain may be more vulnerable to nutritional stress during pregnancy. Overall, these data indicate that both B6N and B6J mice were vulnerable to alcohol but show differences in the severity and location of alcohol-induced dysmorphic facial features and may parallel findings from human studies comparing different ethnic groups. Furthermore, these findings suggest that discriminant analysis may be useful in predicting alcohol exposure in either mouse substrains. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Alcohol (ethanol) consumption during pregnancy is linked to congenital heart defects that are associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent reports have associated ethanol exposure with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Therefore, we defined whether ethanol affects Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during cardiac cell specification. Study Design: Pregnant mice on embryonic day 6.75 during gastrulation were exposed by an intraperitoneal injection to a binge-drinking dose of ethanol. Folic acid supplementation of mouse diet was tested for the prevention of ethanol-induced cardiac birth defects. Results: Acute ethanol exposure induced myocardial wall changes and atrioventricular and semilunar valve defects, which was determined by echocardiography on embryonic day 15.5. A high folate diet prevented the ethanol-induced cardiac defects. Ethanol exposure in avian embryos suppressed 2 key Wnt-modulated genes that are involved in cardiac induction; folic acid rescued normal gene expression. Conclusion: Folic acid supplementation alone or with myoinositol prevented alcohol potentiation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that allowed normal gene activation and cardiogenesis. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - The main objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of meconium analysis for fatty acid ethyl esters as a universal screening tool intended for the detection of newborns at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This will be accomplished by assessing the rate of voluntary participation in a nonanonymous neonatal screening program and by determining the logistics of implementing the necessary follow-up and interventions as part of routine care. Additionally, this study will determine the predictive value of fatty acid ethyl ester-positive meconium with regard to neurodevelopmental delays. This is an ongoing prospective cohort study. Written informed consent is sought from all Grey Bruce women delivering at participating birthing sites. Collected meconium samples are tested for fatty acid ethyl esters by headspace-solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Children with positive results are followed up through an existing public health program involving regular home visits and assessments of developmental milestones by a public health nurse. These children and matched control subjects also undergo neurodevelopmental testing at 3 and 18 months of age by a clinical psychologist using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. If delays are detected, the child is referred to diagnostic services and appropriate intervention programs. This study has been granted ethics approval and enrollment began in November 2008 at St. Joseph Health Care in London, Ontario. The first positive case has been identified and the follow-up is currently being conducted by the public health unit. The successful completing of this study will reveal the population's willingness to participate in a neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure and determine the costs, feasibility, and utility of implementing such programs in clinical practice.

N2  - Objective. To investigate the association between preconception and prenatal alcohol use and abruptio placentae. Methods. A case-control study of women with the clinical diagnosis of abruptio placentae, 65 cases and 66 controls, at Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Western Cape, South Africa. Women in whom a retroplacental blood clot, covering at least 15% of the placental surface, was found at delivery at 24 weeks' gestation or later were asked to complete a timeline follow-back questionnaire to determine their alcohol intake 12 and 3 months before and during pregnancy. The same questionnaire was administered to a control group of high-risk women who had no antepartum haemorrhage. Outcome. Women who drank alcohol 12 months before conception were more than 4 times more likely to develop abruptio placentae than the control group (odds ratio (OR) 4.49, p=0.00009). Women who drank alcohol 3 months prior to conception were 3 times more likely to develop abruptio placentae than the control group (OR 3.06, p=0.003). Drinking alcoholic beverages during pregnancy carried a more than 3 times greater risk of developing abruptio placentae (OR 3.52, p=0.0006). In the study group, women consumed a mean of 13.6, 12.0 and 11.2 standard drinks in a typical week at 12 and 3 months before and during pregnancy, respectively. The study group demonstrated a binge-drinking pattern, with two to four sessions per month. Conclusion. An association was found between preconception and prenatal consumption of alcohol and abruptio placentae.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether treatment with neuroprotective peptides to young adult mice prenatally exposed to alcohol reverses alcohol-induced learning deficits in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the mechanism involves the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and -aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, and whether it is related to glial cells. METHODS: C57Bl6/J mice were treated with alcohol (0.03 ml/g) or placebo on gestational day 8. On day 40, male mice exposed to alcohol in utero were treated daily for 10 days with D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA (n=20) or placebo (n=13); and control offspring were treated with placebo (n=46), with the treatment blinded. Learning evaluation began after 3 days using the Morris watermaze and the T-maze. The hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum were isolated. Expression of NR2A, NR2B, GABAAbeta3, GABAAalpha5, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, and glial fibrillary acidic protein was measured using calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher's protected least significant difference. Results: Treatment with D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA reversed the alcohol-induced learning deficit in both learning tests as well as the NR2A and NR2B down-regulation in the hippocampus and the up-regulation of NR2A in the cortex and NR2B in the cortex and cerebellum (all P<.05). No significant differences were found in GABAA expression. Moreover, the peptides changed activity-dependent neuroprotective protein expression in the cortex (P=.016) but not the down-regulation of VIP (P=.883), probably because the peptides are downstream from VIP. Conclusion: Alcohol-induced learning deficit was reversed and expression of NR2A and NR2B was restored in the hippocampus and cortex of young adult mice treated with D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA. Given the role of NMDA receptors in learning, this may explain in part the mechanism of prevention of alcohol-induced learning deficits by D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA. © 2010 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a challenging public health problem. Previous studies have found an association between FASD and oxidative stress. In the present study, we assessed the role of oxidative stress in ethanol-induced embryonic damage and the effect of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a powerful antioxidant extracted from green tea, on the development of FASD in a murine model.Methods: Pregnant female mice were given intraperitoneal ethanol (25%, 0.005 to 0.02 ml/g) on gestational day 8 (G8) to establish the FASD model. On G10.25, mice were sacrificed and embryos were collected and photographed to determine head length (HL), head width (HW), and crown rump length (CRL). For mice given EGCG, administration was through a feeding tube on G7 and G8 (dose: 200, 300, or 400 mg/kg/d, the total amount for a day was divided into 2 equal portions). G10.25 embryos were evaluated morphologically. Brain tissues of G9.25 embryos were used for RT-PCR and western blotting of neural marker genes and proteins and detection of oxidative stress indicators.Results: Administration of ethanol to pregnant mice on G8 led to the retardation of embryonic growth and down-regulation of neural marker genes. In addition, administration of ethanol (0.02 ml/g) led to the elevation of oxidative stress indicators [hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA)]. Administration of EGCG on G7 and G8 along with ethanol on G8 ameliorated the ethanol-induced growth retardation. Mice given EGCG (400 mg/kg/d) along with ethanol had embryo sizes and neural marker genes expression similar to the normal controls. Furthermore, EGCG (400 mg/kg on G7 and G8) inhibited the increase in H2O2 and MDA.Conclusions: In a murine model, oxidative stress appears to play an important role in ethanol-induced embryonic growth retardation. EGCG can prevent some of the embryonic injuries caused by ethanol. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Altered fetal programming because of a suboptimal in utero environment has been shown to increase susceptibility to many diseases later in life. This study examined the effect of alcohol exposure in utero on N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU)-induced mammary cancer risk during adulthood.Methods: Study 1: Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were fed a liquid diet containing 6.7% ethanol (alcohol-fed), an isocaloric liquid diet (pair-fed), or rat chow ad libitum (ad lib-fed) from day 11 to 21 of gestation. At birth, female pups were cross-fostered to ad lib-fed control dams. Adult offspring were given an I.P. injection of NMU at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Mammary glands were palpated for tumors twice a week, and rats were euthanized at 23 weeks postinjection. Study 2: To investigate the role of estradiol (E2), animals were exposed to the same in utero treatments but were not given NMU. Serum was collected during the preovulatory phase of the estrous cycle.Results: At 16 weeks postinjection, overall tumor multiplicity was greater in the offspring from the alcohol-fed group compared to the control groups, indicating a decrease in tumor latency. At study termination, 70% of all animals possessed tumors. Alcohol-exposed animals developed more malignant tumors and more estrogen receptor-alpha-negative tumors relative to the control groups. In addition, IGF-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) mRNA and protein were decreased in tumors of alcohol-exposed animals. Study 2 showed that alcohol-fed animals had significantly increased circulating E2 when compared to either control group.Conclusions: These data indicate that alcohol exposure in utero increases susceptibility to mammary tumorigenesis in adulthood and suggest that alterations in the IGF and E2 systems may play a role in the underlying mechanism. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Although the structural phenotype of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is established, prenatal exposure to alcohol may produce a broader spectrum of defects, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Documenting the full spectrum of defects associated with FASD is critical to determining the true incidence of this disorder. We examined 831 children from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders using a structured protocol for diagnosis of FAS using the cardinal facial and growth features, and assessment of additional structural defects thought to occur more often in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects were classified as FAS, Deferred (some characteristic features of FAS), or No FAS, Groups were compared on prevalence of additional features and number of additional features observed, stratified by diagnostic category, sex, race, and age. Prevalence of most additional features was greatest among subjects with FAS and least among No FAS. A higher frequency of additional features was observed among FAS and Deferred subjects >12 years of age than among those under 12. FAS and Deferred Whites had greater frequency of additional features than Cape Colored. Prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broad spectrum of structural defects that goes beyond FAS with implications regarding the impact of alcohol on the developing fetus, a prerequisite for ultimate prevention of FASD. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

METHODS: Data from a randomly selected, population-based cohort of nonindigenous women who gave birth to a live infant in Western Australia (WA) between 1995 and 1997 (N = 4714) were linked to WA Midwives Notification System and WA Birth Defects Registry data. We assessed the associations of PAE before pregnancy, in the first trimester, and in late pregnancy with any birth defect and with birth defects classified as alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs) by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), by using logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of birth defects classified as ARBDs by the IOM was low. Compared with abstinence, heavy PAE in the first trimester was associated with increased odds of birth defects classified as ARBDs (adjusted odds ratio: 4.6 [95% confidence interval: 1.5-14.3]), with similar findings after validation through bootstrap analysis. There was no association between low or moderate PAE and birth defects. CONCLUSIONS: A fourfold increased risk of birth defects classified as ARBDs was observed after heavy PAE in the first trimester. Many individual birth defects included in the IOM classification for ARBDs either were not present in this cohort or were not associated with PAE. Large, population-based studies are needed to strengthen the evidence base for ARBDs. Copyright © 2010 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - Infant symbolic play was examined in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure and socioenvironmental background and to predict which infants met criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) at 5 years. A total of 107 Cape-Colored, South African infants born to heavy drinking mothers and abstainers/light drinkers were recruited prenatally. Complexity of play, sociodemographic and psychological correlates of maternal alcohol use, and quality of parenting were assessed at 13 months, and intelligence quotient and FAS diagnosis at 5 years. The effect of drinking on spontaneous play was not significant after control for social environment. In contrast, prenatal alcohol and quality of parenting related independently to elicited play. Elicited play predicted 5-year Digit Span and was poorer in infants subsequently diagnosed with FAS/partial FAS and in nonsyndromal heavily exposed infants, compared with abstainers/light drinkers. Thus, symbolic play may provide an early indicator of risk for alcohol-related deficits. The independent effects of prenatal alcohol and quality of parenting suggest that infants whose symbolic play is adversely affected by alcohol exposure may benefit from stimulation from a responsive caregiver.

N2  - Background: Drinking during pregnancy has been associated with learning disabilities in affected offspring. At present, there are no clinically effective pharmacotherapeutic interventions for these learning deficits. Here, we examined the effects of ABT-239, a histamine H3 receptor antagonist, on fetal ethanol-induced fear conditioning and spatial memory deficits. Methods and Results: Long-Evans rat dams stably consumed a mean of 2.82 g ethanolkg during a 4-hour period each day during pregnancy. This voluntary drinking pattern produced a mean peak serum ethanol level of 84 mgdl. Maternal weight gain, litter size and birth weights were not different between the ethanol-consuming and control groups. Female adult offspring from the control and fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) groups received saline or 1 mg ABT-239kg 30 minutes prior to fear conditioning training. Three days later, freezing time to the context was significantly reduced in saline-treated FAE rats compared to control. Freezing time in ABT-239-treated FAE rats was not different than that in controls. In the spatial navigation study, adult male offspring received a single injection of saline or ABT-239 30 minutes prior to 12 training trials on a fixed platform version of the Morris Water Task. All rats reached the same performance asymptote on Trials 9 to 12 on Day 1. However, 4 days later, first-trial retention of platform location was significantly worse in the saline-treated FAE rats compared control offspring. Retention by ABT-239-treated FAE rats was similar to that by controls. ABT-239's effect on spatial memory retention in FAE rats was dose dependent. Conclusions: These results suggest that ABT-239 administered prior to training can improve retention of acquired information by FAE offspring on more challenging versions of hippocampal-sensitive learning tasks. Further, the differential effects of ABT-239 in FAE offspring compared to controls raises questions about the impact of fetal ethanol exposure on histaminergic neurotransmission in affected offspring.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinical manifestations of FASD are highly variable and include mental retardation and developmental defects of the heart, kidney, muscle, skeleton, and craniofacial structures. Specific effects of ethanol on fetal cells include induction of apoptosis as well as inhibition of proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This complex set of responses suggests that a bioinformatics approach could clarify some of the pathways involved in these responses. Methods: In this study, the responses of fetal stem cells derived from the amniotic fluid (AFSCs) to treatment with ethanol have been examined. Large-scale transcriptome analysis of ethanol-treated AFSCs indicates that genes involved in skeletal development and ossification are up-regulated in these cells. Therefore, the effect of ethanol on osteogenic differentiation of AFSCs was studied. Results: Exposure to ethanol during the first 48 hours of an osteogenic differentiation protocol increased in vitro calcium deposition by AFSCs and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. In contrast, ethanol treatment later in the differentiation protocol (day 8) had no significant effect on the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Conclusions: These results suggest that transient exposure of AFSCs to ethanol during early differentiation enhances osteogenic differentiation of the cells.

N2  - In order to understand the alcohol's toxicity to the quantitative alternations of synapses in mouse visual cortex, the expression of synaptophysin after prenatal alcohol exposure was investigated. In present study, the experimental mice at P0, P7, P14 and P30 were grouped, as control, 2 gkg-1 alcohol treatment and 4 gkg-1 alcohol treatment. The pre-synaptic elements which were used to represent synapses were marked with synaptophysin (a synaptic vesicle associated protein) by immunocytochemistry technique. The synaptophysin positive boutons in layer VI of visual cortex were imaged under laser confocal microscope. With stereological methods, the number cal density of synapse in visual cortex was calculated in different groups at various ages. Moreover, Western blotting was carried out to detect the expression of synaptophysin in visual cortex. The results showed that prenatal alcohol exposure could cause synaptic loss with long-term effect and in a dose dependent manner. For instance, there were significant difference among the different treatment groups of P0, P14 and P30 as well (P < 0.05). Western blotting supported the results of immunofluorescent labeling. In conclusion, prenatal alcohol exposure can induce the synaptic loss dose dependently and with long-term effect. Our findings implicate that the synaptic loss with long term effect in CNS probably contributes to the lifelong mental retardation and memorial lowliness associated with childhood FAS.

N2  - The prenatal ethanol exposure induced the alterations of dendritic spine and synapse in visual cortex and their long-term effect would be investigated in mice from P0 to P30. Pregnant mice were intubated ethanol daily from E5 through the pup's birth to establish mode of prenatal alcohol abuse. The dendritic spines of pyramidal cells in visual cortex of pups were labeled with DiI diolistic assay, and the synaptic ultrastructure was observed under transmission electron microscope. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with a significant decrease in the number of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex and an increase in their mean length; ultrastructural changes were also observed, with decreased numbers of synaptic vesicles, narrowing of the synaptic cleft and thickening of the postsynaptic density compared to controls. Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with long-term changes in dendritic spines and synaptic ultrastructure. The changes were dose-dependent with long term effect even at postnatal 30.

N2  - Objective: Our objective was to evaluate whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and whether the neuroprotective effects of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-related peptides, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), are mediated through BDNF. Study Design: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40. Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization. Results: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P < .05). Pretreatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P < .05) at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P > .05). Conclusion: NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this investigation were to determine the frequencies of and associations between different neurodevelopmental disorders and to study the potential lasting effects of alcohol on children adopted from eastern Europe. METHODS: In a population-based, prospective, observational, multidisciplinary, cross-sectional, cohort study of 71 children adopted from eastern Europe, children were assessed 5 years after adoption, from pediatric, neuropsychological, and ophthalmologic perspectives. RESULTS: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, that is, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, were identified for 52% of children; FAS was found for 30%, partial FAS for 14%, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders for 9%. Alcohol-related birth defects were found for 11% of children, all of whom also were diagnosed as having FAS. Mental retardation or significant cognitive impairment was found for 23% of children, autism for 9%, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder for 51%, and developmental coordination disorder for 34%. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders were common in this long-term follow-up study of children adopted from orphanages in eastern Europe. Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has long-lasting adverse effects, causing structural, behavioral, and cognitive damage despite a radically improved environment.

N2  - Human malformations caused by alcohol consumption in pregnancy have been recognized as the fetal alcohol syndrome for almost 40 years. Prenatal exposure to ethanol is now established as causing permanent brain alterations leading to lifetime adaptive disability. Prevention approaches have not yet yielded a coherent approach to reducing harm from prenatal alcohol exposure. An important component of the Canada Northwest Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Research Network is to develop and assess research that can inform public policy. FASD prevention is a targeted goal. The Networks strategic plan for improving FASD prevention efforts has been implemented, and our progress, to date, in developing a coherent approach involves a social interventions approach, which includes: first, provision of information that might effect individual change; second, direct interactions with women deemed to be at high risk for having children with FASD; third, placement of FASD-prevention programs into a social determinant of health context; and fourth, incorporation of concepts for FASD prevention into other types of intervention programs for women who might also be at high risk for having children with FASD. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.

N2  - Background: Neurocognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in adulthood are not well documented. Questions persist regarding the extent to which there are specific, measurable effects beyond those associated with global ability deficits, whether individuals without the full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) demonstrate alcohol-related cognitive impairments, and whether observed memory effects are specific to a particular modality, i.e., verbal vs. visual/spatial domains. Methods: In this study, verbal and nonverbal selective reminding paradigms were used to assess memory function in 234 young adults (M age: 22.78, SD: 1.79). Alcohol exposure was quantified prenatally. Alcohol groups included: Individuals with physical effects of alcohol exposure (Dysmorphic group, n = 47); Exposed individuals without such effects (n = 74). Contrast groups included: Controls (n = 59) matched for ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and hospital of birth; Special Education contrast group (n = 54) included to control for disability status. Memory outcomes entailed total recall, delayed recall, and measures of encoding and retrieval, and learning over trials as indexed by slope. Results: Results indicated that Dysmorphic individuals were significantly less efficient in memory performance than Controls on all of the outcomes measured, but they did not differ from those in the Special Education contrast group. The nondysmorphic, alcohol-exposed group was intermediate in their performance, suggesting a continuum of effects of prenatal exposure. Evaluation of the encoding and retrieval aspects of memory performance indicated that learning rather than forgetting accounted for the deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Finally, no interaction was found between modality of presentation (verbal and nonverbal) and effects of alcohol exposure on memory performance. Conclusion: These findings indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with persistent and specific effects on memory performance, and these problems result from less efficient encoding of information across both verbal and nonverbal modalities. Education and training efforts with this clinical group should take these characteristics into account. Copyright © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - There is increasing evidence that human pregnancy outcome can be significantly compromised by suboptimal maternal nutritional status. Poor diet results in a maternal-fetal environment in which the teratogenicity of other insults such as alcohol might be amplified. As an example, there is evidence that zinc (Zn) can interact with maternal alcohol exposure to influence the risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Studies with experimental animals have shown that the teratogenicity of alcohol is increased under conditions of Zn deficiency, whereas its teratogenicity is lessened when animals are given Zn-supplemented diets or Zn injections before the alcohol exposure. Alcohol can precipitate an acute-phase response, resulting in a subsequent increase in maternal liver metallothionein, which can sequester Zn and lead to decreased Zn transfer to the fetus. Importantly, the teratogenicity of acute alcohol exposure is reduced in metallothionein knockout mice, which can have improved Zn transfer to the conceptus relative to wild-type mice. Consistent with the above, Zn status has been reported to be low in alcoholic women at delivery. Preliminary data from two basic science and clinical nutritional studies that are ongoing as part of the international Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders support the potential role of Zn, among other nutritional factors, relative to risk for FASD. Importantly, the nutrient levels being examined in these studies are relevant to general clinical populations and represent suboptimal levels rather than severe deficiencies. These data suggest that moderate deficiencies in single nutrients can act as permissive factors for FASD, and that adequate nutritional status or intervention through supplementation may provide protection from some of the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2010 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

N2  - Objectives: To examine biobehavioral responses to an acute pain event in a Cape Town, South Africa, cohort consisting of 28 Cape Colored (mixed ancestry) newborns (n = 14) heavily exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (exposed), and born to abstainers (n = 14) or light (<0.5 oz absolute alcohol/d) drinkers (controls). Methods: Mothers were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Newborn data were collected on postpartum day 3 in the maternity obstetrical unit where the infant had been delivered. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was defined as maternal consumption of at least 14 drinks/wk or at least 1 incident of binge drinking/mo. Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and recovery). After a feeding and nap, newborns were administered an abbreviated Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. Results: There were no between-group differences in maternal age, marital status, parity, gravidity, depression, anxiety, pregnancy smoking, maternal education, or infant gestational age at birth (all ps > 0.15). In both groups, HR increased with the heel lance and decreased during the postlance period. The alcohol-exposed group had lower mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time. Cortisol levels showed no change over time in controls but decreased over time in exposed infants. Although facial action analyses revealed no group differences in response to the heel lance, behavioral responses assessed on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale showed less arousal in the exposed group. Conclusions: Both cardiac autonomic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress reactivity measures suggest a blunted response to an acute noxious event in alcohol-exposed newborns. This is supported by results on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale indicating reduced behavioral arousal in the exposed group. To our knowledge, these data provide the first biobehavioral examination of early pain reactivity in alcohol-exposed newborns and have important implications for understanding neuro-/biobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the newborn period. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is associated with numerous neurobehavioral alterations, as well as disabilities in a number of domains, including a high incidence of depression and anxiety disorders. Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) also alters hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function, resulting in increased responsiveness to stressors and HPA dysregulation in adulthood. Interestingly, data suggest that pre-existing HPA abnormalities may be a major contributory factor to some forms of depression, particularly when an individual is exposed to stressors later in life. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to stressors in adulthood may unmask an increased vulnerability to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in PAE animals. Methods: Male and female offspring from prenatal alcohol (PAE), pair-fed (PF), and ad libitum-fed control (C) treatment groups were tested in adulthood. Animals were exposed to 10 consecutive days of chronic mild stress (CMS), and assessed in a battery of well-validated tasks sensitive to differences in depressive- and/or anxiety-like behaviors. Results: We report here that the combination of PAE and CMS in adulthood increases depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in a sexually dimorphic manner. PAE males showed impaired hedonic responsivity (sucrose contrast test), locomotor hyperactivity (open field), and alterations in affiliative and nonaffiliative social behaviors (social interaction test) compared to control males. By contrast, PAE and, to a lesser extent, PF, females showed greater levels of "behavioral despair" in the forced swim test, and PAE females showed altered behavior in the final 5 minutes of the social interaction test compared to control females. Conclusions: These data support the possibility that stress may be a mediating or contributing factor in the psychopathologies reported in FASD populations. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: The attention and cognitive problems seen in individuals with a history of prenatal alcohol exposure often resemble those associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but few studies have directly assessed the unique influence of each on neurobehavioral outcomes. Methods: We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during a Go/No-go response inhibition task in young adults with prospectively obtained histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and childhood ADHD. Results: Regardless of prenatal alcohol exposure, participants with childhood ADHD were less accurate at inhibiting responses. However, only the ADHD group without prenatal alcohol exposure showed a markedly diminished P3 difference between No-go and Go, which may reflect a more effortful strategy related to inhibitory control at the neural processing level. Conclusion: This finding supports a growing body of evidence suggesting that the manifestation of idiopathic ADHD symptoms may stem from a neurophysiologic process that is different from the ADHD symptomatology associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Individuals who have been prenatally exposed to alcohol and present with ADHD symptomatology may represent a unique endophenotype of the disorder, which may require different treatment approaches from those found to be effective with idiopathic ADHD. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Ethanol acutely inhibits ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated responses and long-term potentiation in the developing CA1 hippocampus
A1  - Puglia M.P.
A1  - Valenzuela C.F.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Developmental ethanol (EtOH) exposure damages the hippocampus, causing long-lasting alterations in learning and memory. Alterations in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity may play a role in the mechanism of action of EtOH. This signaling is fundamental for synaptogenesis, which occurs during the third trimester of human pregnancy (first 12 days of life in rats). Methods: Acute coronal brain slices were prepared from 7- to 9-day-old rats. Extracellular and patch-clamp electrophysiological recording techniques were used to characterize the acute effects of EtOH on alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor (AMPAR)- and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 hippocampal region. Results: Ethanol (40 and 80 mM) inhibited AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). EtOH (80 mM) also reduced AMPAR-mediated fEPSPs in the presence of an inhibitor of Ca2+ permeable AMPARs. The effect of 80 mM EtOH on NMDAR-mediated fEPSPs was significantly greater in the presence of Mg 2+. EtOH (80 mM) neither affected the paired-pulse ratio of AMPAR-mediated fEPSPs nor the presynaptic volley. The paired-pulse ratio of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents was not affected either, and the amplitude of these currents was inhibited to a lesser extent than that of fEPSPs. EtOH (80 mM) inhibited LTP of AMPAR-mediated fEPSPs. Conclusions: Acute EtOH exposure during the third-trimester equivalent of human pregnancy inhibits hippocampal glutamatergic transmission and LTP induction, which could alter synapse refinement and ultimately contribute to the pathophysiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Here we investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to methamphetamine (MA) on local brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging. Because many who use MA during pregnancy also use alcohol, a known teratogen, we examined whether local brain volumes differed among 61 children (ages 5-15 years), 21 with prenatal MA exposure, 18 with concomitant prenatal alcohol exposure (the MAA group), 13 with heavy prenatal alcohol but not MA exposure (ALC group), and 27 unexposed controls. Volume reductions were observed in both exposure groups relative to controls in striatal and thalamic regions bilaterally and in right prefrontal and left occipitoparietal cortices. Striatal volume reductions were more severe in the MAA group than in the ALC group, and, within the MAA group, a negative correlation between full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) scores and caudate volume was observed. Limbic structures, including the anterior and posterior cingulate, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and ventral and lateral temporal lobes bilaterally, were increased in volume in both exposure groups. Furthermore, cingulate and right IFG volume increases were more pronounced in the MAA than ALC group. Discriminant function analyses using local volume measurements and FSIQ were used to predict group membership, yielding factor scores that correctly classified 72% of participants in jackknife analyses. These findings suggest that striatal and limbic structures, known to be sites of neurotoxicity in adult MA abusers, may be more vulnerable to prenatal MA exposure than alcohol exposure and that more severe striatal damage is associated with more severe cognitive deficit.

N2  - Aims: The aim of this study was to review systematically, research investigating an association between the continuous performance task (CPT) in children and exposure to alcohol in utero, in order to identify any evidence of a specific deficit in performance. Methods: Seven electronic databases and three websites were searched. Papers were selected in accordance with specific inclusion criteria and scored in terms of the methodological quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa score. Marked methodological heterogeneity limited the validity of any statistical meta-analysis and a descriptive synthesis was performed instead. Results: A total of 14 papers were identified for inclusion. There was no consistent evidence of any association between prenatal alcohol exposure and correct responses, reaction time, commission or omission errors during CPT testing. Apparent trends in the reported results, however, suggest that a potential effect might have been missed. Conclusions: Identifying a specific profile of CPT performance may assist in the detection and management of attention deficits amongst children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Future research with more consistent measures of exposure and outcome is, however, required before any valid generalizations about CPT performance can be made. © The Author 2009.

T1  - Phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibition does not restore ocular dominance plasticity in a ferret model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
A1  - Krahe T.E.
A1  - Paul A.P.
A1  - Medina A.E.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: There is growing evidence that deficits in neuronal plasticity account for some of the neurological problems observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Recently, we showed that early alcohol exposure results in a permanent impairment in visual cortex ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in a ferret model of FASD. This disruption can be reversed, however, by treating animals with a Phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 1 inhibitor long after the period of alcohol exposure. Aim: Because the mammalian brain presents different types of PDE isoforms we tested here whether inhibition of PDE type 4 also ameliorates the effects of alcohol on OD plasticity. Material and Methods: Ferrets received 3.5 g/Kg alcohol i.p. (25% in saline) or saline as control every other day between postnatal day (P) 10 to P30, which is roughly equivalent to the third trimester equivalent of human gestation. Following a prolonged alcohol-free period (10 to 15 days), ferrets had the lid of the right eye sutured closed for 4 days and were examined for ocular dominance changes at the end of the period of deprivation. Results: Using in vivo electrophysiology we show that inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram does not restore OD plasticity in alcohol-treated ferrets. Conclusion: This result suggests that contrary to PDE1, PDE4 inhibition does not play a role in the restoration of OD plasticity in the ferret model of FASD. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and childhood balance: A systematic review

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Balance problems in childhood have known adverse psychosocial associations such as poorer quality of life and lower educational achievement. Previous longitudinal studies have documented an adverse effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on a variety of neurodevelopmental outcomes and so an effect on balance would seem plausible. This is supported by a previous laboratory study that found that rats exposed to ethanol in utero have dysfunctional balance and gait. The present study is a systematic review of the current evidence on the effects of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy on offspring balance in childhood. A search strategy was devised and applied in the CENTRAL database (Cochrane Collaboration). Prospective longitudinal studies were then sought using databases including Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL and AMED. In addition, citations in relevant published papers and books were followed up and experts in the field were contacted. No relevant human experimental studies were found. Four longitudinal studies were found to have assessed balance in preschool children. Only one of these studies suggested strong or substantial effects of alcohol exposure on balance-related outcomes. However, this study appeared the most methodologically robust. In conclusion, at present, there is limited evidence on the possible effects of alcohol exposure on childhood balance. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine exposure to alcohol may result in a distinct pattern of craniofacial abnormalities and central nervous system dysfunction, designated fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The spectrum of malformations of the brain associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy is much broader than the relatively uniform clinical phenotype of FAS. Among these malformations the most striking abnormalities involve the impairment of neuronal cell migration. However, polymicrogyria (PMG) has so far been reported only once in a human autopsy study of a child with FAS. CASE: A 16-year-old girl with confirmed maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and full phenotype of FAS presented after two generalized epileptic seizures for neurologic assessment. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral PMG in the superior frontal gyrus with asymmetric distribution. History, clinical features, and genetic investigations provided no evidence for any of the known genetic or acquired causes of PMG. Therefore, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of PMG in this patient rather than a mere coincidence. CONCLUSION: Our observation represents only the second patient of PMG in FAS and confirms the phenotypic variability of cerebral malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In patients with clinical features of FAS and neurologic deficits or seizures neuroimaging is recommended. Furthermore, FAS should be considered as a differential diagnosis for PMG. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - To gain more insights into the translational and PTM that occur in rat offspring exposed to alcohol in utero, 2-D PAGE with total, phospho- and glycoprotein staining and MALDI-MS/ MS and database searching were conducted. The results, based on fold-change expression, revealed a down-regulation of total protein expression by prenatal alcohol exposure in 7-dayold and 3-month-old rats. There was an up-regulation of protein phosphorylation but a downregulation of glycosylation by prenatal alcohol exposure in both age groups. Of 31 protein spots examined per group, differentially expressed proteins were identified as ferritin light chain, aldo-keto reductase, tumor rejection antigen gp96, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and -actin. Increased phosphorylation was observed in proteins such as calmodulin, gluthatione S-transferase, glucose regulated protein 58, alpha-enolase, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 beta-2, riboprotein large P2, agmatinase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase, formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase, and actin. In addition, glycosylation of adenosine kinase, adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, and 3-hydroxyanthranilate dioxygenase was reduced. Pathways affected by these protein alterations include cell signaling, cellular stress, protein synthesis, cytoskeleton, as well as glucose, aminoacid, adenosine and energy metabolism. The activity of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was elevated by prenatal alcohol. The observations may have important physiological implications. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

N2  - Alcohol is known to impede the growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through cellular apoptosis. We have previously shown that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure results in brain defects at different stages of development. In this study, we further characterize the proteomic architecture underlying ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using chromatography in conjunction with a LC-MS/MS system. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E13 with either a 25% ethanol derived calorie or pair-fed liquid diets. At E13, fetal brains were collected from five dams for each group. Individual brains were homogenized and the extracted proteins were then tryptically digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Label-free quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on proteomes extracted from fetal brains of both alcohol-treated (ALC) and pair-fed groups. These analyses demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure induced significant downregulation (p<0.001) of the expression of mitochondrial enzymes including ADP/ATP translocase 1, ATP synthase subunit a and ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductases. In addition, mitochondrial carrier homolog 1, which plays a role in apoptosis, was significantly downregulated (p<0.001) in the ALC group. Moreover, among the cytosolic proteins that were significantly downregulated (p<0.001) are Bcl-2, 14-3-3 protein and calmodulin. Significant downregulation (p<0.001) of proteins that are critical for fetal brain development was observed such as prohibitin and neuronal migration protein doublecortin. These findings provide information about possible mechanisms underlying the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure during early embryonic stage. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

N2  - The effects of heavy maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy on cognitive and behavioural performance and craniofacial malformations in the offspring have been studied extensively. In contrast, the impact of maternal alcohol intake on the cardiovascular system of the offspring and the effects of more modest consumption have received very scant consideration. 2. Adverse conditions in the pre- and neonatal periods can have a profound legacy on offspring health, including the risk of cardiovascular disease. Prenatal alcohol exposure can modulate vascular reactivity, including endothelial and smooth muscle function. 3. Other effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are emerging, including impairment of nephrogenesis and kidney function and increased arterial stiffness. The impact of even modest prenatal alcohol exposure on cardiovascular health in the offspring remains to be determined. 4. It is envisaged that the culmination of reduced renal and vascular capacity will render the offspring more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease with ageing and exposure to additional insults and lifestyle factors. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

N2  - Background: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) often demonstrate a variety of cognitive deficits, but mathematical ability seems to be particularly affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Parietal brain regions have been implicated in both functional and structural studies of mathematical ability in healthy individuals, but little is known about the brain structure underlying mathematical deficits in children with FASD. The goal of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the relationship between mathematical skill and brain white matter structure in children with FASD. Methods: Twenty-one children aged 5 to 13 years diagnosed with FASD underwent DTI on a 1.5-T MRI scanner and cognitive assessments including the Woodcock-Johnson Quantitative Concepts test. Voxel-based analysis was conducted by normalizing subject images to a template and correlating fractional anisotropy (FA) values across the brain white matter with age-standardized math scores. Results: Voxel-based analysis revealed 4 clusters with significant correlations between FA and math scores: 2 positively-correlated clusters in the left parietal region, 1 positively-correlated cluster in the left cerebellum, and 1 negatively-correlated cluster in the bilateral brainstem. Diffusion tractography identified the specific white matter tracts passing through these clusters, namely the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, left corticospinal tract and body of the corpus callosum, middle cerebellar peduncle, and bilateral projection fibers including the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule. Conclusions: These results identify 4 key regions related to mathematical ability and provide a link between brain microstructure and cognitive skills in children with FASD. Given previous findings in typically developing children and those with other abnormal conditions, our results highlight the consistent importance of the left parietal area for mathematical tasks across various populations, and also demonstrate other regions that may be specific to mathematical processing in children with FASD. © 2009 Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Although several reports have been published showing prenatal ethanol exposure is associated with alterations in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit levels and, in a few cases, subcellular distribution, results of these studies are conflicting. Methods: We used semi-quantitative immunoblotting techniques to analyze NMDA receptor NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunit levels in the adult mouse hippocampal formation isolated from offspring of dams who consumed moderate amounts of ethanol throughout pregnancy. We employed subcellular fractionation and immunoprecipitation techniques to isolate synaptosomal membrane- and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95)-associated pools of receptor subunits. Results: We found that, compared to control animals, fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) adult mice had: (i) increased synaptosomal membrane NR1 levels with no change in association of this subunit with PSD-95 and no difference in total NR1 expression in tissue homogenates; (ii) decreased NR2A subunit levels in hippocampal homogenates, but no alterations in synaptosomal membrane NR2A levels and no change in NR2A-PSD-95 association; and (iii) no change in tissue homogenate or synaptosomal membrane NR2B levels but a reduction in PSD-95-associated NR2B subunits. No alterations were found in mRNA levels of NMDA receptor subunits suggesting that prenatal alcohol-associated differences in subunit protein levels are the result of differences in post-transcriptional regulation of subunit localization. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure induces selective changes in NMDA receptor subunit levels in specific subcellular locations in the adult mouse hippocampal formation. Of particular interest is the finding of decreased PSD-95-associated NR2B levels, suggesting that synaptic NR2B-containing NMDA receptor concentrations are reduced in FAE animals. This result is consistent with various biochemical, physiological, and behavioral findings that have been linked with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2009 Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been linked to a wide array of developmental deficits, including significant impairments in social skills. Given the extensive body of evidence linking social information-processing patterns with social behavior, it is possible that social information-processing may represent one mechanism of behavioral change. The present investigation sought to answer the question of whether a well-established social skills intervention decreased the hostile attributions of children with PAE. Further, was there a differential impact of the intervention on hostile attributions in the context of peer provocation versus group entry scenarios? Methods: Participants consisted of 100 children (51% male) with PAE between the ages of 6 and 12 years. Participants were randomly assigned to either a social skills intervention, Children's Friendship Training (CFT), or to a Delayed Treatment Control (DTC) condition. Results: Analyses indicated that the social skills intervention resulted in a significantly lower proportion of hostile attributions in peer group entry, but not peer provocation, scenarios. This decrease was maintained over a 3-month follow-up period. Conclusions: Deficits in social information-processing among individuals with PAE can be improved through social skills intervention, and these changes may lead to more positive developmental outcomes. © 2009 Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The study sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of being at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) among women of child-bearing age in an urban and rural location in South Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional household survey of 1018 women aged 18-44 years in one urban (n = 606) and one rural (n = 412) site. The women were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. We defined the primary dependent variable, being at risk of having an AEP, as current alcohol use, not being pregnant, being fertile, and no effective use of contraceptives. The independent variables included demographic, substance use, health perceptions, psycho-social, and partner characteristics. The rural women (21.84%) were more likely than their urban counterparts (11.22%) to be at risk of an AEP. In multiple logistic regression analyses, significant predictors of being in the "at risk" group for the urban women were (a) being 'white' as opposed to 'black/African', and being 'coloured' as opposed to 'black/African'; and (b) current smoking. For the rural women, significant risk factors were (a) current smoking and (b) early onset of alcohol use. The significant protective factors were (a) education; (b) knowledge about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; (c) parity. Use of stricter alcohol use criteria (i.e., three or more drinks and five or more drinks per sitting) in the definition of risk of an AEP yielded slightly different patterns of significant predictors. The results revealed high levels of risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, especially amongst the rural women, and a need for location-specific prevention programmes. The high burden of AEP in South Africa calls for the establishment of national AEP prevention strategies and programmes as a matter of urgency. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: This magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM)-based report is the second in a series designed to illustrate the spectrum of craniofacial and central nervous system (CNS) dysmorphia resulting from single- and multiple-day maternal ethanol treatment. The study described in this report examined the consequences of ethanol exposure on gestational day (GD) 7 in mice, a time in development when gastrulation and neural plate development begins; corresponding to the mid- to late third week postfertilization in humans. Acute GD 7 ethanol exposure in mice has previously been shown to result in CNS defects consistent with holoprosencephaly (HPE) and craniofacial anomalies typical of those in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). MRM has facilitated further definition of the range of GD 7 ethanol-induced defects. Methods: C57Bl/6J female mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered vehicle or 2 injections of 2.9 g/kg ethanol on day 7 of pregnancy. Stage-matched control and ethanol-exposed GD 17 fetuses selected for imaging were immersion fixed in a Bouins/Prohance solution. MRM was conducted at either 7.0 Tesla (T) or 9.4 T. Resulting 29 mum isotropic spatial resolution scans were segmented and reconstructed to provide 3D images. Linear and volumetric brain measures, as well as morphological features, were compared for control and ethanol-exposed fetuses. Following MRM, selected specimens were processed for routine histology and light microscopic examination. Results: Gestational day 7 ethanol exposure resulted in a spectrum of median facial and forebrain deficiencies, as expected. This range of abnormalities falls within the HPE spectrum; a spectrum for which facial dysmorphology is consistent with and typically is predictive of that of the forebrain. In addition, other defects including median facial cleft, cleft palate, micrognathia, pituitary agenesis, and third ventricular dilatation were identified. MRM analyses also revealed cerebral cortical dysplasia/heterotopias resulting from this acute, early insult and facilitated a subsequent focused histological investigation of these defects. Conclusions: Individual MRM scans and 3D reconstructions of fetal mouse brains have facilitated demonstration of a broad range of GD 7 ethanol-induced morphological abnormality. These results, including the discovery of cerebral cortical heterotopias, elucidate the teratogenic potential of ethanol insult during the third week of human prenatal development. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters adult neurogenesis and the neurogenic response to stress in male rats. As the effects of stress on neurogenesis are sexually dimorphic, the present study investigated the effects of PAE on adult hippocampal neurogenesis under both nonstressed and stressed conditions in female rats. Pregnant females were assigned to one of three prenatal treatments: (1) alcohol (PAE)-liquid alcohol (ethanol) diet ad libitum (36% ethanol-derived calories); (2) pair-fed-isocaloric liquid diet, with maltose-dextrin substituted for ethanol, in the amount consumed by a PAE partner (g/kg body wt/day of gestation); and (3) control-lab chow ad libitum. Female offspring were assigned to either nonstressed (undisturbed) or stressed (repeated restraint stress for 9 days) conditions. On day 10, all rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and perfused either 24 hours (cell proliferation) or 3 weeks (cell survival) later. We found that PAE did not significantly alter cell proliferation or survival, whereas females from the pair-fed condition exhibited elevated levels of cell survival compared to control females. Importantly, however, the proportion of both new neurons and new glial cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was reduced in PAE compared to control females. Exposure to stress did not alter neurogenesis in any of the prenatal treatment groups. In summary, compared to females from the control condition, prenatal dietary restriction enhanced the survival of new neurons, whereas PAE altered the differentiation of newly produced cells in the adult dentate gyrus. Alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis following PAE may contribute to learning and memory deficits seen in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common nongenetic cause of mental retardation and is characterized by neurodevelopmental anomalies. C-fos is a cellular marker of transcriptional activity in the stress-signal pathway. Previously, we showed the treatment with NAP (NAPVSIPQ)+SAL (SALLRSIPA) reversed the learning deficit after prenatal alcohol exposure in FAS. Our objective was to evaluate if the mechanism of actions of NAP+SAL involves the stress-signal pathway differentiating c-fos expression in mouse brains after prenatal alcohol exposure. C57Bl6/J mice were treated with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or placebo on gestational day 8. On postnatal day 40, in utero alcohol-exposed males were treated via gavage with 40 mug D-NAP and 40 mug D-SAL (n=6) or placebo (n=4); controls were gavaged with placebo daily (n=12). After learning evaluation, hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex were isolated. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were performed. Statistics included analysis of variance and post hoc Fisher analysis. Adult treatment with NAP+SAL restored the down-regulation of c-fos in the hippocampus after prenatal alcohol exposure (p<0.05), but not in the cerebellum. There was no difference in c-fos expression in the cortex. Adult treatment with NAP+SAL restored the down-regulation of c-fos expression in hippocampus attenuating the alcohol-induced alteration of the stress-signal pathway.

N2  - This study identified structural changes in the caudate nucleus in offspring of mothers who drank moderate levels of alcohol during pregnancy. In addition, the effect of duration of alcohol use during pregnancy was assessed. Young adults were recruited from the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project. Three groups were evaluated: prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) during all three trimesters (3T), PAE during the first trimester only (1T), and controls with no PAE (0T). Magnetic resonance images were processed using the automated labeling pathway technique. Volume was measured as the number (gray. +. white) and relative percentage (caudate count/whole brain count x 100) of voxels. Asymmetry was calculated by subtracting the caudate volume on the left from the right and dividing by the total (L. ?. R/L. +. R). Data analyses controlled for gender, handedness, and prenatal tobacco and marijuana exposures. There were no significant differences between the groups for whole brain, left, or right volumes. There was a dose-response effect across the three exposure groups both in terms of magnitude and direction of asymmetry. In the 3T group, the left caudate was larger relative to the right caudate compared to the 0T group. The average magnitude of caudate asymmetry for the 1T group was intermediate between the 0T and 3T groups. Subtle anatomical changes in the caudate are detected at the moderate end of the spectrum of prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The present experiment assessed motor response programming and movement time in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PEA). Alcohol-exposed children between the ages of 7 and 17 years were classified into two groups: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS: n=9) and children with PEA (PEA: n=19) but who did not have the defining characteristics of FAS. The FAS and PEA children were compared with non-alcohol-exposed children (NC: n=23) when completing two tasks: a simple reaction time task (RT alone condition) and a reaction plus movement task (RT. +. Move condition). The movement involved responding to an imperative stimulus signal and depressing three target buttons in a set sequence. Participants completed 24 trials each for the RT alone and RT. +. Move response conditions. Results indicated no significant differences in performance among FAS, PEA, and NC groups during the RT alone condition. However, during the RT. +. Move condition, the FAS group produced significantly longer and more variable RTs than the PEA and NC groups, which produced comparable RTs. The FAS group also produced significantly slower movement times when moving to all three targets, whereas movement time variability did not significantly differ as a function of group. The observed results indicate children with FAS experience deficits in response programming and movement time production. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - We previously demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure results in brain defects at different embryonic stages. This study is aimed at characterizing the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure on the levels of several neurotransmitters at early embryonic stage 13 (E13). Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to either a 25% ethanol derived calorie diet (ALC) or pair-fed (PF) liquid diet from E7 to E13. At E13, fetal brains were collected from dams of the ALC and PF groups. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was then used to evaluate neurotransmitter levels. This approach involved the use of an LC column in conjunction with multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Quantitative analyses of catecholamines, idolamine, and amino acid neurotransmitters revealed significant reductions in the levels of dopamine (p=0.004), norepinephrine (p=0.0009), epinephrine (p=0.0002), serotonin (p=0.004), and GABA (p=0.002) in the ALC group compared to the PF group. However, there was no significant change in the levels of glutamate in E13 fetal brains. These findings demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure reduces the concentrations of some catecholamines, idolamine, and amino acid neurotransmitters in E13 fetal brains. This study suggests that alterations of selective neurotransmitters may be the cause of abnormalities in brain function and behavior found in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2010 ISDN.

N2  - Directional asymmetry, the systematic differences between the left and right body sides, is widespread in human populations. Changes in directional asymmetry are associated with various disorders that affect craniofacial development. Because facial dysmorphology is a key criterion for diagnosing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the question arises whether in utero alcohol exposure alters directional asymmetry in the face. Data on the relative position of 17 morphologic landmarks were obtained from facial scans of children who were classified as either FAS or control. Shape data obtained from the landmarks were analyzed with the methods of geometric morphometrics. Our analyses showed significant directional asymmetry of facial shape, consisting primarily of a shift of midline landmarks to the right and a displacement of the landmarks around the eyes to the left. The asymmetry of FAS and control groups differed significantly and average directional asymmetry was increased in those individuals exposed to alcohol in utero. These results suggest that the developmental consequences of fetal alcohol exposure affect a wide range of craniofacial features in addition to those generally recognized and used for diagnosis of FAS. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading preventable causes of developmental disabilities with serious permanent consequences. Regardless of the increased awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 13% of women in the United States drink alcohol during pregnancy. Health care professionals do not routinely assess the frequency and quantity of alcohol use by their patients. This study examined the knowledge, skills, and practices of family medicine residency and clerkship directors and assessed the time devoted and format of FAS curricula in the programs. A self-administered anonymous survey was sent to the residency and clerkship directors (N=571). Response rate of clerkship directors was 52% and residency directors 46%. Both groups showed high level of knowledge of FASD and of alcohol counseling practices for pregnant women. Although almost two thirds of the residency programs had FASD integrated in the curriculum, an equivalent fraction of predoctoral programs did not. More than half of the clerkship directors without FASD in their curriculum agreed that a need exists for its inclusion. These findings raise important medical education and policy issues and provide insight into the disparity in FASD content of curricula between predoctoral and family medicine residency programs in the United States. The role of physician counseling in primary prevention of FAS should continue to be stressed in predoctoral and residency education. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Many children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy cannot be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We conducted a preliminary investigation to determine whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene expression may have some utility as a diagnostic indicator of maternal drinking during pregnancy and as a prognostic indicator of risk for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in affected offspring. Pregnant Long-Evans rats voluntarily consumed either a 0 or 5% ethanol solution 4 h each day throughout gestation. Ethanol consumption produced a mean maternal daily intermittent peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. Placentas were harvested on gestational day 20 for gene expression studies. Microarray analysis of more than 28,000 genes revealed that the expression of 304 known genes was altered twofold or greater in placenta from ethanol-consuming dams compared with controls. About 76% of these genes were repressed in ethanol-exposed placentas. Gene expression changes involved proteins associated with central nervous system development; organ morphogenesis; immunological responses; endocrine function; ion homeostasis; and skeletal, cardiovascular, and cartilage development. To date, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis has confirmed significant alterations in gene expression for 22 genes, including genes encoding for three calcium binding proteins, two matrix metalloproteinases, the cannabinoid 1, galanin 2 and toll-like receptor 4, iodothyronine deiodinase 2, 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, placental growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, gremlin 1, and epithelial growth factor (EGF)-containing extracellular matrix protein. These results suggest that the expression of a sufficiently large number of placental mRNAs is altered after moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of the placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD. Furthermore, these results provide new insights into novel mechanisms on how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate its teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function during pregnancy. © 2010.

N2  - Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) requires detection of in-pregnancy maternal risk drinking. The widely used T-ACE screen has been applied in various ways, although the impact of those different uses on effectiveness is uncertain. We examined relations among different T-ACE scoring criteria, maternal drinking, and child outcome. Self-reported across-pregnancy maternal drinking was assessed in 75 African-American women. The different T-ACE criteria used varied the level of drinking that defined tolerance (two or three drinks) and the total T-ACE score cut-points (two or three). Receiver operator curves and regression analysis assessed the significance of relations. Increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point to 3 almost doubled specificity in detecting risk drinking whereas maintaining adequate sensitivity, equivalent to that in the original report, and identified substantially more neurobehavioral deficits in children. Redefining tolerance at three drinks did not improve T-ACE effectiveness in predicting outcomes. This study is among the first to show the ability of an in-pregnancy T-ACE assessment to predict child neurodevelopmental outcome. In addition, increasing the total T-ACE score criterion (from 2 to 3) improved identification of non-drinking mothers and unaffected children with little loss in detection of drinkers and affected children. Efficient in-pregnancy screens for risk drinking afford greater opportunities for intervention that could prevent/limit FASDs. andcopy; 2010.

N2  - Detecting patterns of maternal drinking that place fetuses at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is critical to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention but is challenging because information on antenatal drinking collected during pregnancy is often insufficient or lacking. Although retrospective assessments have been considered less favored by many researchers due to presumed poor reliability, this perception may be inaccurate because of reduced maternal denial and/or distortion. The present study hypothesized that fetal alcohol exposure, as assessed retrospectively during child adolescence, would be related significantly to prior measures of maternal drinking and would predict alcohol-related behavioral problems in teens better than antenatal measures of maternal alcohol consumption. Drinking was assessed during pregnancy, and retrospectively about the same pregnancy, at a 14-year follow-up in 288 African-American women using well-validated semistructured interviews. Regression analysis examined the predictive validity of both drinking assessments on pregnancy outcomes and on teacher-reported teen behavior outcomes. Retrospective maternal self-reported drinking assessed 14 years postpartum was significantly higher than antenatal reports of consumption. Retrospective report identified 10.8 times more women as risk drinkers (andge; one drink per day) than the antenatal report. Antenatal and retrospective reports were moderately correlated and both were correlated with the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy based on retrospective report identified significantly more teens exposed prenatally to at-risk alcohol levels than antenatal, in-pregnancy reports. Retrospective report predicted more teen behavior problems (e.g., attention problems and externalizing behaviors) than the antenatal report. Antenatal report predicted younger gestational age at birth and retrospective report predicted smaller birth size; neither predicted teen IQ. These results suggest that if only antenatal, in-pregnancy maternal report is used, then a substantial proportion of children exposed prenatally to risk levels of alcohol might be misclassified. The validity of retrospective assessment of prior drinking during pregnancy as a more effective indicator of prenatal exposure was established by predicting more behavioral problems in teens than antenatal report. Retrospective report can provide valid information about drinking during a prior pregnancy and may facilitate diagnosis and subsequent interventions by educators, social service personnel, and health-care providers, thereby reducing the life-long impact of FASDs. andcopy; 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Project CHOICES developed an integrated behavioral intervention for prevention of prenatal alcohol exposure in women at high risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Settings included primary care, university-hospital based obstetrical/gynecology practices, an urban jail, substance abuse treatment settings, and a media-recruited sample in three large cities. The intervention was based on motivational interviewing and targeted both adoption of effective contraception and reduction of alcohol use. Treatment included 4 manual-guided sessions delivered by mental health clinicians and 1 contraceptive counseling session delivered by a family planning clinician. This paper describes the rationale for treatment; the use of motivational interviewing and the transtheoretical model for a dual-focused approach to behavior change; the development of the Project CHOICES intervention; development of the study protocol and treatment manual; and selection, training, supervision, and monitoring of study counselors. Implications for future applications of the intervention are discussed. © 2009 Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.

T1  - Can prenatal screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder be justified? A commentary
A1  - Mizejewski G.J.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading cause of non-genetic mental retardation in the USA, possibly exceeding even Down syndrome, which is currently approaching 1 in 500 live births. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in brain, craniofacial and heart defects, neurotoxicity, and immune dysfunction. The preferred action taken to prevent alcohol consumption during pregnancy is abstinence. However, the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD remain a major public health need in this country and throughout the world. The biochemical molecules involved in the developmental anomalities encompass a vast array of signal transduction and synaptic pathways which involve neurotransmitters and neurotrophic peptides. Recent advances in medicine-based therapies for FASD have been reported, and include the use of small molecule agonists, antagonists, and competitive inhibitors. Since biomarkers for FASD have previously been identified in clinical research reports, multicenter screening feasibility studies now seem warranted and could be initiated following adequate funding, protocols, procedures, and institutional review board approvals. © 2009 S.

N2  - This ongoing collaborative study investigates the nutrient and oxidative stress status of alcohol-exposed Ukrainian pregnant women and whether micronutrient supplementation with and without choline, a nutrient critical for brain development, will reduce Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in the offspring. Analysis to date of maternal baseline plasma samples shows that alcohol-exposed women (N=49) had lower Zn and Cu concentrations, and Total Radical-trapping Antioxidant Potential (TRAP) vs. controls (N=40). There were no differences in Fe, ferritin, Mg, Ca, or ceruloplasmin activity. Methyl-donor nutrients (choline, betaine, DMG, folate, Vit B12, and homocysteine), Vit A, E and select carotenoids, and oxidative stress (TBARS, protein carbonyls) and inflammation (hsCRP) indices were similar. Absolute oz. of alcohol/drinking day during the 2 wks prior to interview was associated with higher Vit A and ferritin, and lower Vit B12. The low Zn, Cu and Vit B12 in ethanol-exposed women may contribute to adverse fetal development. It has been reported that alcohol increases body Fe stores, which can lead to oxidative stress. In our study, alcohol intake was associated with increased ferritin in pregnant women, which, when coupled with lower TRAP, may increase oxidative stress-induced teratogenesis. These data will be updated as sample size requirements are met.

N2  - Purpose: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) include growth deficiency, birth defects, and neurobehavioral impairment, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100 live births. An ongoing study investigates whether nutritional inadequacies of alcohol-exposed Ukrainian pregnant women amplify alcohol teratogenicity, and whether micronutrient supplementation with and without choline, a nutrient critical for brain development, will reduce FASD in the offspring. Methods: As part of an international collaborative study on FASD, pregnant women in Ukraine who report moderate to heavy alcohol use in early pregnancy, or no or low amounts of alcohol (controls), are prospectively recruited. Women are then randomly assigned to receive micronutrient supplementation, with and without choline, or no supplementation. At enrollment, and at 32 weeks gestation, blood is collected and analyzed for vitamin, mineral and oxidative stress status. Results: Analysis to date of maternal baseline (gestational age: 20.6 +/- 0.7 weeks) plasma samples shows that alcohol-exposed women (n = 49) had lower Zn and Cu concentrations, and Total Radical-trapping Antioxidant Potential (TRAP) than controls (n = 40). Concentrations of iron, ferritin, magnesium and calcium, and ceruloplasmin activity were similar between groups. There was no difference in concentrations of methyl-donor nutrients (choline, betaine, DMG, folate, Vitamin B12, and homocysteine), or Vitamins A, E and select carotenoids. Indices of oxidative stress (TBARS, protein carbonyls) and inflammation (hsCRP) were also similar. Absolute oz. of alcohol/drinking day during the 2 weeks prior to interview was associated with higher Vitamin A and ferritin, and lower Vitamin B12. Conclusion: Low Vitamin B12 status in ethanol-exposed women may contribute to adverse fetal development. It has been reported that alcohol increases body Fe stores, which can lead to oxidative stress. In our study, alcohol intake was associated with increased ferritin. This, coupled with the compromised Zn and Cu status, and the lower antioxidant capacity of the blood (TRAP) observed in alcohol-exposed women may increase alcohol-induced oxidative damage and potentiate alcohol teratogenicity. This continuing study will determine whether maternal nutrient status, before and after micronutrient supplementation, can modulate the risk for FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts physical, neurological, and behavioral development, leading to a range of effects referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The outcome among children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy varies widely and some of this variation may be due to nutritional factors. We have been examining the effects of manipulating levels of choline, a nutrient that is essential for brain development and function, on alcohol's teratogenic effects. Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed diets containing either 40% or 100% recommended choline levels throughout pregnancy. Subjects were exposed to 6.0 g/kg/day ethanol from gestational days 5-20 via intubation; pair-fed and ad lib chow controls were included. The moderate choline deficiency exacerbated ethanol's adverse effects on physical and behavioral development, including deficit in hind-limb coordination and overactivity in the open field. In contrast, choline supplementation (250 mg/kg/day) during prenatal alcohol exposure (6.0 g/kg/day) reduces the severity of alcohol-induced body weight deficits, physical defects and deficits in psychomotor and cognitive development. Moreover, choline supplementation during the postnatal period, after alcohol exposure has ceased, can reduce the severity of alcohol-induced overactivity in the open field as well as alcohol-induced deficits on a variety of learning and memory, including working memory, spatial memory, reversal learning, and trace Pavlovian conditioning. These findings suggest that choline may still be effective even after the alcohol-related damage is complete. In sum, these data indicate that even moderate suboptimal nutritional status may exacerbate some of ethanol's teratogenic effects, a finding with important implications for the prevention of FASD. Moreover, these data indicate that choline supplementation, either during prenatal or postnatal development, may serve as an effective treatment for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Central nervous system development and function requires vitamin A (retinol). Retinol has no known activity itself; rather, its metabolite all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) supports most of its biological functions. atRA initiates neurogenesis and dendritic growth in the hippocampus and is required for spatial memory. Super-physiological atRA inhibits neurogenesis and alters cognitive function and behavior. Because abnormal atRA shares pathologies with alcoholism, inhibition of retinol activation into atRA has been credited as contributing to ethanol toxicity, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo by rigorous analysis of atRA during normal vitamin A nutriture. We developed robust analytical techniques, based on LC/MS/MS, to quantify atRA and determine the effects of ethanol. In no instance did ethanol decrease physiological atRA levels in vivo during normal vitamin A nutriture in the tissues analyzed (serum, liver, brain, testis, kidney). Ethanol either increased or had no effect on atRA, despite changes in retinol and retinyl esters (RE), i.e., ethanol caused widespread changes in RE and retinol, but tissue/region specific increases in atRA. Postnatally, ethanol produced large atRA increases in hippocampus and testis, areas sensitive to both ethanol exposure and increased atRA. One-month feeding a liquid diet with 6.5% ethanol (Lieber-DeCarli diet) increased atRA in adult hippocampus (20-fold), cortex (2-fold) and serum (10-fold). Feeding dams the Lieber-DeCarli diet from e13-e18 increased atRA in fetal hippocampus (1.5 to 20-fold) and cortex (2 to 50-fold), depending on blood alcohol content. Tissue-specific increases in retinoid dehydrogenase mRNAs and activities, extra-hepatic retinol concentrations, and atRA catabolism, combined to produce site-specific effects. The ethanol-induced atRA increases in fetal hippocampus and cortex extend beyond the range reported to cause phenotypic changes. Prenatal ethanol exposure, similar to the exposure used here, has been reported to decrease the number of dendritic spines and their length in mouse hippocampus, and causes abnormal architecture in rat hippocampus. Thus, our data of ethanol-induced atRA increases at selective sites in the developing brain, and the literature concluding that increasing atRA modestly causes pathological consequences, suggest that ethanol-induced superphysiological atRA concentrations contributes to ethanol's pathology, including cognitive dysfunction and fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Prevention of alcohol use is difficult thus therapies that ameliorate alcohol's damage are desirable. The severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) increases with parity, implying the depletion of a protective maternal factor, perhaps a nutrient. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in women and causes neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring that parallel FASD. We hypothesized that moderate maternal iron inadequacy (ID) potentiates alcohol's effects upon the developing brain and tested this in rat pups reared on dams fed iron-sufficient (IS) or ID diets. We exposed pups to 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg/day alcohol during the brain growth spurt period via gastric gavage (postnatal days 4-9; P4-9). ID dams had subclinical iron deficiency and were not anemic; their liver iron stores were depleted. In the offspring, ID amplified the reduction of body growth caused by alcohol exposure. At P10, ID pups were anemic, and they had significantly more apoptosis in the cerebellum than did either alcohol-exposed or ID pups separately. During adolescence, the ID-alcohol combination did not affect a select set of neurobehavioral skills involving motor coordination. However, the ID-alcohol combination significantly exacerbated the alcohol-induced deficits of associative learning, measured using delay eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC), a cerebellumdependent task. Their values for conditioned response frequency and amplitude were ~30% of the responses in ID-only or alcohol-only animals. The ID-alcohol combination also significantly impaired outcomes in a second test of associative learning, contextual fear conditioning. This is the first study to show that maternal iron inadequacy profoundly exacerbates alcohol's teratogenicity and its impact upon behavioral outcomes. We propose that maternal iron status is an important modulator of fetal neurobehavioral outcome following alcohol exposure.

N2  - Alcohol drinking during pregnancy is the cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Variability of the outcome of infants exposed to similar amounts of ethanol in utero remains an unresolved issue. Similarities between patients with FASD and patients with mutations in L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1) implicate L1 as a target for ethanol. Several studies have addressed this hypothesis. Our laboratory has shown that (i) ethanol inhibits L1-mediated neurite outgrowth with an IC50 of 3-5 mM; (ii) that downstream signaling of L1 is inhibited by ethanol; and (iii) that the proximal downstream signaling interaction is with p60src. Both L1 and p60src have been described in lipid rafts, specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane enriched in phosphatidylcholine and GM1 ganglioside. Recently we have found that pharmacologic concentrations of ethanol increase the proportion of L1 present in lipid rafts in cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and in an in vivo rat pup model. These results suggest that altered trafficking of L1 through lipid rafts may underlie ethanol's effects on L1 mediated neurite outgrowth. We propose that interventions that normalize L1 trafficking through lipid rafts would minimize ethanol's impact. Namely that choline and GM1 ganglioside supplementation would reduce ethanol's effects on L1 - lipid raft interactions. We further propose that maternal choline and GM1 ganglioside nutritional status may play a role in the severity of fetal outcome. According to this hypothesis, our recent data demonstrate that supplementation of CGN with choline and GM1 ganglioside (C/GM1) reduces the redistribution of L1 to lipid rafts and prevents the inhibition of L1 downstream signaIing. Further, we have shown that C/GM1 supplementation is required for 18 hour to be effective. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ethanol's effects on L1 distribution in lipid rafts underlie the inhibitory effects of ethanol on L1 function and can be ameliorated by maternal choline and GM1 ganglioside nutritional status.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the most important consequences are neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Education has not reduced the incidence of FASD leading to a growing interest in understanding the mechanisms of action for the purpose of developing therapeutic prevention or mitigation strategies. Based on the observation that maternal ethanol consumption reduces maternal and fetal pH, we hypothesized that a pH-sensitive pathway involving the TWIK-related acid sensitive potassium channels (TASKs) is implicated in ethanol-induced injury to the fetal cerebellum, one of the most sensitive targets of prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant sheep received alcohol intravenously (258+/-10 mg/dl peak blood ethanol concentration) or saline in a "3 days/week binge" pattern throughout the third trimester. Quantitative stereological analysis demonstrated that alcohol resulted in a 45% reduction in the total number of fetal cerebellar Purkinje cells, the cell type most sensitive to developmental alcohol exposure. Extracellular pH manipulation to create the same degree and pattern of pH fall caused by ethanol (manipulations large enough to inhibit TASK 1 channels), resulted in a 24% decrease in Purkinje cell number. We determined immunohistochemically that TASK 1 channels are expressed in Purkinje cells and that the TASK 3 isoform is expressed in granule cells of the ovine fetal cerebellum. Pharmacological blockade of both TASK 1 and TASK 3 channels simultaneous with alcohol effectively prevented any reduction in fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell number. We have also demonstrated that alcohol exposure causes both maternal and fetal compartment alterations in plasma amino acid concentrations including glutamine. Glutamine is important in maternal pH homeostasis, the regulation of apoptosis and reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species. These results demonstrate the functional significance of fetal cerebellar two pore domain pH-sensitive channels and establishes them as a potential therapeutic target for prevention of alcohol teratogenesis and raises the possibility that glutamine may provide a nutritional/nutriceutical approach to affect the actions of these channels and or defend maternal pH to protect the fetus.

N2  - The Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD) comprises clinical and basic scientists who collectively aim to expand knowledge about fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). One goal of the CIFASD is the development of neurobehavioral profiles that specifically define FASD, which may assist differential diagnosis or improve treatment. A second goal is to combine data collected using multiple methodologies across multiple sites. This presentation will include 2 analyses. The first focuses on the neurobehavioral profile, and the second on the relation of this profile to measures of dysmorphology. Data were collected using a broad neurobehavioral protocol and dysmorphology examination. Subjects were children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and children with unexposed controls. The alcohol-exposed group included children with and with out fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). For the first analysis, data were analyzed using latent profile analysis (LPA). Twenty-two variables were selected from over 500 neuropsychological variables, based on their ability to distinguish children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls. The resulting profile was successful at distinguishing subjects with FAS from nonexposed controls without FAS with 92% overall accuracy; 87.8% of FAS cases and 95.7% of controls were correctly classified. The same analysis was repeated with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure but without FAS and non-exposed controls with similar results. The overall accuracy was 84.7%; 68.4% of alcohol-exposed cases and 95% of controls were correctly classified. In the second analyses, these neurobehavioral variables were correlated with measures of dysmorphology. Results revealed significant correlations between measures of neurobehavioral function and dysmorphology. Results of these combined analyses will be discussed.

N2  - Within the last decade, brain imaging studies have yielded considerable insights into the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure on developing brain structure, brain function, and brain-behavior relationships. Using multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and state-of-the-art image analysis techniques, we and others have shown that brain morphological abnormalities in children with prenatal alcohol exposure are regionally specific, and not merely reflective of the overall microcephaly common in this disorder. Specifically, we have observed increased cortical thickness, decreased brain size and decreased white matter density (WMD) in parietal and posterior temporal regions. Decreased brain activation has been observed in the posterior temporal language regions during a verbal learning task, in the same region where increased cortical thickness was seen suggesting that an abundance of cortical tissue does not provide functional advantage in those with severe prenatal alcohol exposure. In addition to overall white matter volume reductions, shape abnormalities have been noted in white matter structures such as the corpus callosum. We have also recently observed abnormalities of white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging which may help explain findings of posterior callosal dysmorphology and cortical thickness abnormalities in posterior perisylvian regions. In addition to cortical abnormalities, we have observed significant volume reductions in striatal and thalamic structures in 2 independent samples of children with FASDs who were studied as part of the CIFASD. In all of these studies, neurobehavioral correlates of brain dysmorphology have been observed such that those with more dysmorphic brain structure or activation have more impaired performance on various neuropsychological measures. More severe facial dysmorphology has also been associated with more severe brain dysmorphology. Findings from studies of normally developing children without prenatal exposure aid interpretation of the abnormal trajectory of development in FASDs. Findings from all of these studies will be discussed.

N2  - Prenatal teratogens such as alcohol increase the risk of childhood onset externalizing problems, but intermediary mechanisms are not well understood. Adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure demonstrate poorer executive functioning and greater risk taking behavior, but these findings have not been replicated on younger samples of youths such as preschoolers, and mediating factors have not been tested. This study examined whether deficits in executive functioning mediated the relation between prenatal exposure to alcohol and childhood onset externalizing behaviors in a community sample of non-FAS and FAE preschool children whose mothers endorsed drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Results found severity of prenatal alcohol exposure was related to poorer executive functioning (r=-.269) even after controlling for maternal mental health and family socioeconomic status, and poorer executive functioning was significantly related to worse externalizing problems (r=-.473) when controlling for maternal factors and SES. Relations between prenatal exposure to alcohol and externalizing problems, however, varied depending on caregiver reports and were nonsignificant when controlling for maternal psychopathology and SES. Developmental and environmental considerations are discussed.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol consumption is one of the most pressing medical and social problems in Russia. It is known that the level of alcohol consumption in Russia, both for men and for women is very high. High alcohol consumption among women in their childbearing years constitutes a high risk for alcohol exposed pregnancies (AEP) and developing FASD in children. The purpose of this study is to investigate trends in alcohol use among non-pregnant women of childbearing age between 2005 and 2009 in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region (NNR) in Russia and examine the trends found in different age groups. Method: This study uses data from Preventing FAS/ARND in Russian Children studies that have been conducted by the Prevent FAS Research Group in 2004-2009 [1]. Three waves of surveys assessing women's self-reported weekly alcohol consumption and binge drinking levels were conducted in 2004-2005, 2007, and 2009. A total of 760 non-pregnant women aged 18-44 were included in the study. Data were derived in 3 age groups: 18-22, 23-30, and 31-44 year-olds. Prevalence of alcohol use, number of drinks per week, and prevalence and frequency of binge drinking were analyzed. Statistical significance of the relationship between the time and age groups was tested. Results: There was no age group difference in weekly consumption while binge drinking was significantly more prevalent in younger age groups. Significant changes in frequency of binge drinking and weekly consumption in 2005-2007 were identified. Frequency of binge drinking increased between 2005 and 2007, while weekly consumption decreased. The 2009 survey data are being analyzed currently and data will be included in the presentation. Conclusion: Increasingly hazardous alcohol consumption by women of childbearing age in Russia is a major public health concern and FASD prevention measures need to be in place.

N2  - Background: The relation between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and trans-generational alcohol use is under-studied; many pre/postnatal factors can influence teen alcohol use. Our extensive longitudinal assessment of a cohort evaluated at ages 7 and 14 allow us to test potential mechanisms that predict early teen drinking. We hypothesized that PAE would be associated with increased teen alcohol use even after controlling for multiple indices of teen functioning, caregiving, environment, and demographics. Methods: Pregnant African American women were interviewed at each antenatal visit about alcohol use during the preceding 2 weeks. At 14 years, early teen alcohol abuse by their offspring was measured via K-SADS-PL. Relation between PAE and teen alcohol abuse was examined using multiple regression controlling for other prenatal exposures and postnatal alcohol exposure; maternal/caregiver variables: custody status, age at conception, marital status, education, IQ, psychopathology; environment: SES, home quality, number of children in home; violence exposure; and teen factors: gender, age at testing, 7-year blood lead level, IQ, executive functioning, teen behavior problems, GPA, and academic achievement. Variables were entered into the regression in the following order: teen variables, violence exposure, caregiver/environment, other pre/postnatal exposures, and finally PAE. Teen variables were entered first as these variables may be most proximately related to current teen drinking. Results: Even after the inclusion of multiple potential predictors of teen alcohol use, PAE significantly predicted teen alcohol abuse diagnosis (beta =.22, p =.001). Other significant predictors of teen alcohol abuse included violence exposure (beta =.17, p =.01), teen age (beta =.15, p =.02), and teen IQ (beta =.23, p =.03). Teen variables accounted for just under 8% of the explained variance (R2 =.077). Violence exposure and maternal/caregiver variables also accounted for significant amounts of explained variance (R2 =.024 and.013 respectively). Prenatal alcohol exposure explained an additional 4% of unique variance (R2 =.036). Conclusions: Controlled analysis from our prospective longitudinal cohort demonstrated that even beyond potent proximate influences of family and environment, PAE increases alcohol abuse in adolescents, consistent with the hypothesis that PAE increases the likelihood of early risk drinking. Studies evaluating underlying mechanisms of this transgenerational effect are warranted.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure leads to CNS damage mainly affecting cell proliferation, neuronal migration and death. Though extensive studies have been performed, the role of protein synthesis which has been shown to modulate normal neuronal functions is poorly understood. Ethanol (ETOH) has been reported to inhibit hepatic and muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, we hypothesized whether disruption of protein synthetic processes (translation) could mediate neurodegeneration. To address this first we examined the effect of ETOH on protein synthesis in primary cortical neurons. ETOH significantly inhibited protein synthesis as assessed by radioactive amino acid incorporation. In the process of identifying a molecular target, we next examined the expression of PDCD4 a translation suppressor that is reported to promote apoptosis. For the first time we demonstrate that ETOH increased PDCD4 protein expression in a time-and dose-dependent manner in PCN. We also show that ETOH transcriptionally regulates PDCD4 expression by RT qPCR. PDCD4 is known to interact with eIF4A and inhibit translation initiation by blocking the RNA helicase activity of latter which is required for unwinding the complex 5'UTR of mRNA to initiate translation. Therefore, Inhibition of translation is expected to result from diminished association of eIF4A with capmRNA. So, we next examined whether the dissociated eIF4A from methyl cap is associated with PDCD4. Immunoprecipitation of PDCD4 from methyl cap associated eIF4A depleted supernatants, when immunoblotted with eIF4A exhibited increased eIF4A association on ETOH treatment, suggesting augmented sequestration by PDCD4. This data was further supported by the increase in cytosolic PDCD4 which is a requirement for translation inhibition. To confirm the involvement of PDCD4 in the aforementioned inhibition we employed siRNA knockdown strategy. Targeting of PDCD4 in neurons mitigated the effect of ETOH on protein synthesis. Above all, PDCD4 knockdown resulted in neuroprotection as assessed by FACS analysis of Annexin V staining. To surmise, this study provides a novel mechanism by which ETOH targets protein translation involving PDCD4 leading to neuronal degeneration.

N2  - Women who consume alcohol during pregnancy are at risk of giving birth to children with a pattern of physical, developmental, and functional defects collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Approximately 40,000 infants in the United States are born with FASD per year, costing an estimated $6 billion in health, education, and social services. Ethanol is the main constituent of consumable alcohol and is the addictive neuroactive compound that causes FASD. However, therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of FASD are not available. While prenatal ethanol exposure affects development of almost all organs, the brain and craniofacial features show the most severe defects. The cerebellum is particularly sensitive to the effects of ethanol during development. Our studies have demonstrated that high dose of ethanol (blood ethanol concentration 80 mM) induces apoptosis in the external granule layer of cerebellum, and inhibits the differentiation and reduces the survival of cerebellar granule cells. At this concentration, ethanol also increases oxidative stress in the cerebellum and in cerebellar granule cells. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin polyphenolic compound found in various plants, including grapes, berries and peanuts. It exhibits a wide range of pharmacological effects, including prevention of heart disorders, blocking of lipoprotein oxidation, free radical scavenging, prevention of apoptosis, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. It mimics caloric restriction by extending the lifespan of different organisms via activation of deacetylases from the sirtuin family. Recent studies have shown that resveratrol exhibits neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress. Using a rodent model of FASD we further demonstrate that resveratrol prevents ethanol-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in the external granule layer of cerebellum and in cerebellar granule cells. It also prevents harmful ethanol effects on the survival and differentiation of cerebellar granule cells. Together our studies demonstrate that resveratrol may be a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of FASD.

N2  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of comprehensive community-based interventions to reduce fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in two populations from the Northern Cape Province in South Africa. Methods: Changes in the prevalence of FASD, and in maternal knowledge and drinking behaviour, were assessed in De Aar and Upington, Northern Cape Province, before and after an intensive community-level intervention. Eight community workers implemented educational activities to raise awareness of the risks of maternal drinking and to alter community norms about alcohol use in pregnancy. All children were examined by two dysmorphologists at 9 months of age and those with evidence of FASD were reassessed at 18 months. Neuropsychometrists evaluated infant neurodevelopment. Structured maternal interviews with FASD cases and matched controls determined patterns of alcohol use and knowledge about FASD. Results: At baseline, 809 children were evaluated, 751 after intervention. FASD prevalence pre-intervention was 8.9% (72/809) and 5.7% post intervention (43/751; p =.02). In multivariate logistic regression, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity, FASD prevalence was 0.73 fold lower post-intervention than pre-intervention (95%CI=0.58-0.90; p =.004). Dysmorphology scores reduced from 4 at baseline (IQR=2-7) to 3 (IQR=1-6; p =.002). After intervention, a large proportion of women reported having received educational messages, levels of knowledge about alcohol increased and some changes were detected in attitudes to drinking. Conclusion: Comprehensive community-level interventions might reduce the burden of FASD in heavily-affected areas of South Africa, by about 30%. This, the first study ever to document the effectiveness of FASD prevention using clinical outcomes, suggests that comprehensive community-level services should be implemented in similar settings to reduce this very common, oft neglected, disorder.

N2  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Many women drink during their childbearing years as well as use ineffective contraception. FAS-PACE Stepped Care Intervention (FSCI) utilized the Project CHOICES brief intervention model in implementing this "research to practice" model into 4 public health settings. In addition, FSCI utilized Case Management (CM) practices in two CM tiers. FSCI implementation goals were to prevent alcohol-exposed births by reducing alcohol use among women of childbearing age and/or increasing contraceptive knowledge/utilization. The purpose was to develop, implement, and evaluate population-based and targeted prevention programs for FASD Prevention. The project measured five main outcomes of the FSCI: 1. Reduce alcohol use among women of childbearing age 2. Reduce alcohol use among pregnant women. 3. Increase effective contraception 4. Decreased unintended pregnancies 5. Decrease stress levels The methods used were a multi-point, 3-Step, longitudinal design. The sample included 535 women between the ages of 12 and 44 who were sexually active (SA) risk drinking (RD) and were ineffectively using contraception or pregnant. Results: FAS-PACE intervention methods significantly reduced the number of women who self-reported binge drinking and increased the number of women who used effective contraception in all three interventions. The stress levels were reduced in the case-managed Personal Skills and Personal Support interventions (p <.000). Narrative Summaries: FAS-PACE consisted of a stepped care intervention utilizing a continuum of services from brief intervention to 6 month intervention and to intensive 3 year intervention. Personal CHOICES program (brief intervention) had 244 women who received services. At the three-month follow-up, 68 women were contacted and of those, 34 (50%) no longer participated in binge drinking activities. At the six-month follow-up, 42 of 70 previous binge drinkers reported no longer drinking at risk levels. Forty women reported not using contraception effectively at intake with 24 doing so at the six-month follow-up. Personal SKILLS (up to 6 month intervention) program resulted in women reducing binge drinking at the (p <.05) level. The conclusion reached was that despite poor follow-up in this commonly transient population the FSCI program resulted in decreased risk drinking and increased contraception use among participants.

N2  - Due to the physical and psychological consequences of in utero alcohol exposure, it is imperative that caregivers have evidence-based interventions that lead to a decrease in alcohol use during pregnancy. Interventions based on theoretically active components of behavior change and motivation have the potential to decrease prenatal alcohol use and, consequentially, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. This study determined the effectiveness of a Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention in decreasing prenatal drinking. The influence of the MI intervention on pregnant women's drinking behaviors as mediated by Self-Determination Theory's concepts of basic psychological needs and autonomous motivations determined what mechanisms of the intervention evoked a change in behavior. Of 171 pregnant women who reported previous year alcohol use, 67 consented to participate with random assignment to an MI Intervention (MII) group or a No-MI Intervention Comparison (NIC) group. After receiving education regarding risks of prenatal alcohol use, both groups were assessed for alcohol usage, levels of basic psychological needs, and autonomous motivations at baseline and 4-6 week follow-up. The MII group received the intervention following the baseline assessments. Fifty-six pregnant women completed all study procedures. Structural equation modeling determined the effectiveness of the intervention in decreasing pregnant women's drinking behaviors as mediated by basic psychological needs and autonomous motivations over the 4-6 week period. Two significant paths were found between the type of intervention group and (i) changes in number of drink days per week (p <.05) and (ii) gains in levels of basic psychological needs (p <.05) with the NIC group reporting greater changes in both at follow-up. The MI intervention provided by this study was not found effective in decreasing pregnant women's drinking behaviors during pregnancy. Confounders, such as the standard education provided to both groups by the researcher who was trained in MI, may have provided an additional intervention that decreased the women's drinking behaviors in both groups. Decreased variability in levels of reported drinking, basic psychological needs, and autonomous motivations reported by the two groups at baseline may also have affected the results. This study provided the groundwork for future interventions that will assist pregnant women to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Our prior studies demonstrated that physicians in Russia had limited knowledge about FASD and did not address risks for alcohol exposed pregnancies (AEP) in their practices. FASD were addressed neither in the curriculum at medical schools nor in the curriculum for required Continuing Education (CE). The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate FASD training curriculum for health professionals in Russia [1]. The study was conducted by the Prevent FAS in Russia Research Group [2]. Results of a randomized educational trial testing the developed materials at continuing education (CE) courses for OBGs and pediatricians will be presented. Methods: Core FASD modules and timeframe of FASD training for the CE courses were identified. Randomized trials in a pre-post test design to determine the effectiveness of the training in changing physicians' knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward drinking during pregnancy were conducted. OBGs (N=60) and pediatricians (N=66) from different regions of Russia were recruited to the study through CE courses at the St. Petersburg Pediatric Academy. The physicians were trained in groups by specialty. The groups were randomly assigned to either experimental (a FASD module is included) or control conditions (regular CE course without a FASD module). A total of 14 groups were conducted. Measures: Participants' pre-post changes in FASD knowledge, attitudes, and skills were assessed using questionnaires. In addition, OBGs' skills were assessed using coded videotapes of training role plays with a simulated patient. Results: Physicians who received FASD training had significantly more knowledge about the effects of alcohol use during pregnancy and less acceptance of alcohol use during pregnancy than physicians who did not receive training. Pediatricians who received training had higher levels of competency in FAS detection and diagnosis. OBGs who received training improved their competency and skills in preventing AEP. Conclusions: FASD are completely preventable by avoiding alcohol use during pregnancy and preventing FAS/FASD is an important public health objective. This study demonstrated that a three-hour FASD education module included in CE for pediatricians and OBGs can lead to significant changes in their knowledge, attitudes, and skills.

N2  - Background: Despite efforts to increase public awareness and explicit recommendations to avoid alcohol while pregnant, rates of prenatal alcohol consumption have not declined in the last decade. Healthcare providers that interact regularly with the population at risk, have the utmost potential of preventing or changing this abusive behavior. Therefore, we aimed in this study to determine if obstetricians, family practitioners and pediatricians are aware of current recommendations, are well informed about fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and whether healthcare providers' own bias to alcohol consumption affected how information was conveyed to their patients. Methods: Staff, fellow, and resident physicians within the Cleveland Clinic system were surveyed using a web-based survey tool. The survey consisted of 38 questions on practice characteristics, knowledge of FASD, awareness of the risks of prenatal alcohol consumption, counseling practice, comfort level discussing FASD, social/moral attitudes regarding alcohol consumption, and demographics. Results: 12% of physicians felt that 1-3 drinks per week is safe while trying to become pregnant. Most physicians felt it was unsafe to consume alcohol while pregnant, but 10% felt that it is safe to consume alcohol during the third trimester. About a quarter of physicians were uncomfortable about discussing alcohol consumption with their patients and half of them stated that they are not current with the literature on prenatal alcohol exposure. More than 25% of physicians felt that they were not adequately trained to counsel their patients on the dangers prenatal alcohol exposure and more than half felt that their colleagues were not well educated on the subject. More male physicians felt that women who consume alcohol while pregnant should be subject to legal penalties, while more female physicians and physicians who have children felt that women who consume alcohol while pregnant are solely responsible for their actions if they continue to drink after being counseled. Finally, 90% of physicians felt that they have a professional responsibility to protect the developing embryo from alcohol consumption. Conclusion: From the results obtained we have concluded that obstetricians, pediatricians, and family practitioners need to be better informed on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. With this knowledge they can then convey this information to women of childbearing age and ultimately prevent FASD.

N2  - Alcohol drinking during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, with fetal alcohol syndrome being the most severe form of this disorder showing a collection of birth defects which include facial dysmorphology and neurological dysfunctions. Recently, it has been suggested that alcohol-mediated changes in microRNA profiles may account for the deficits associated with fetal alcohol exposure. MicoRNAs (miRNA) are non-coding RNAs approximately 21-23 nucleotides in length that are able to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding to target mRNA and either causing transcript degradation or halting translation. In this study, a zebrafish embryo model was used to examine an early alcohol exposure regimen during gastrulation on specific 2 miRNAs: miR-430a and let-7h. In early development of the zebrafish, miR-430 has been shown to regulate morphogenesis, clearance of maternal mRNAs, and brain rescue in MZdicer mutants; and let-7 is known to be involved in cell migration in the nervous system development. The zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 0.32, or 2% (w/v) alcohol (ethanol) beginning at 3.5 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and the treatment lasted for 4 hours during the gastrulation stage of the zebrafish embryo development. These developing embryos were evaluated for morphological alterations at 48 hpf and were sacrificed for miRNA analysis. MiRNA was isolated using the mirVana Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real time RT-PCR was used to verify the quantitative changes in miRNA expression with SYBR green based RT-PCR using MyiQ single-color RT-PCR detection system (BioRad). The RT-PCR data was normalized to U6 snRNA. The results showed that zebrafish embryos exposed to 2% alcohol exhibited significant morphological alterations, such as cardiac edema and a curved vertebral column. However, such defects were not observed in embryos exposed to 0.32% alcohol. The miRNA expression data showed that alcohol treatment did not alter the expression of let-7h or miR-430a. Nonetheless, the data showed a trend in decreasing mean deltaCT in the 2% alcohol treated group suggesting an increase in the expression of miR-430a, and a similar pattern of trend was found in the let-7h analysis.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure often results in neurodevelopmental deficit and growth retardation constituting phenotypes of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The type and extent of expression of these phenotypes following prenatal alcohol exposure depends on multifactorial environmental and genetic interactions, which are not well understood. We previously reported that mouse embryos exposed to alcohol (88 mM) at the stage of neurulation cause growth retardation and abnormal development of embryos with two major phenotypes - neural tube closed (Alc-NTC) and neural tube opened (Alc-NTO). We further demonstrated significant differences in DNA methylation between the Alc-NTO and Alc-NTC phenotypes, including a 10-fold greater number of methylated genes on Chromosome 10 and X in Alc-NTO than Alc-NTC (Liu et al., 2009). Here we show that genes on the X chromosome display increased DNA methylation and cluster together, both physically and functionally. Genomic location analysis showed that the 178 genes reside in 8 separate clusters within a chromosomal band of 0.5-3 cM: bands XqA1.1 (0.5 cM, 14 genes from Ppp1r3f-Ftsj1), XqA1.3 (0.25 cM, 7 genes from Ndufb11-Zfp182), XqA5 (1 cM, 6 genes from 3830403N18Rik-Zic3), XqA7.3 (1.5 cM, 17 genes from Nsdhl-Brcc3), XqD (2 cM, 10 genes from Ercc6l-Atp7a), XqF1 (1 cM, 9 genes from Bex2-Il1rapl2), XqF3 (2.5 cM, 13 genes from Pfkb1-Magea1) and XqF5 (1.5 cM, 9 genes from Ap1s2-Egf16). Ingenuity analysis further revealed that these gene clusters are closely related in function, including in cell cycle, cell death, cellular growth and proliferation, nervous system development, cancer, and cardiovascular system development. Analysis of gene expression using Affymetrix microarrays supported an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression for some genes. For example, Ftsj1 and Zic3, which are specifically responsible for the developmental disorders X-linked mental retardation and neural tube defects, showed increased methylation. The current study demonstrates that DNA methylation may serve as both a marker to predict neural tube defect and as a mechanism underlying abnormal gene function in fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Background: Heavy drinking during pregnancy is the cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), the leading known cause of mental retardation. L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1), a protein critical for promotion of neurite outgrowth is considered a major target for ethanol toxicity in FASD. Our previous studies suggest that ethanol inhibits L1 mediated neurite outgrowth by increasing the fraction of L1 within lipid rafts (LR). Objective: Our objective in this study is to determine whether the effect of ethanol is on the LR or on L1. We utilize L1 KO mice to prepare cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) that had only LR but no L1. Thus, exposure of these cells to ethanol only exposes LR, and not L1. Exposure of wild type (WT) CGN exposes both L1 and some LR. Our hypothesis is that if LR are the target of ethanol, then ethanol exposed LR (present in lysates of KO CGN) mixed with unexposed L1 (present in lysates of WT CGN) contains more L1 than unexposed KO CGN mixed with unexposed WT CGN. If L1 is the target, then ethanol exposed L1 (present in lysates of WT CGN) redistributes to unexposed LR (present in lysates of KO CGN). Methods: CGN from L1 KO and WT postnatal day 6 mice are cultured overnight separately. For ethanol exposure, CGN are incubated in 25 mM ethanol for 1 hour. Neurons are washed free of ethanol, suspended in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer at a ratio of L1 KO:WT 4:1 (to dilute the LR in WT) and mixed on ice for 1 hour. LR are isolated from the mixed lysates using sucrose density gradients. Ten fractions are collected and LR containing fractions are pooled (LR) and the remaining fractions are pooled (non-LR). Western blotting is performed to identify L1 in LR and non-LR. L1 is quantified by densitometry and the percent of total L1 in lipid rafts (%L1 in LR) is calculated (pixels in LR)/(pixels in LR + non-LR). Results: The %L1 in LR are: 7%,-/-KO/WT; 12.4%,-/+ KO/WT; 24.5%, +/-KO/WT; 22.7%, +/+ KO/WT. Only when the LR are exposed to ethanol does the %L1 in LR increase. Conclusion: This data may demonstrate that ethanol alters lipid rafts thereby increasing L1 within them.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure leads to long-lasting deficits in learning and memory. Using a rat model, we have previously shown that choline supplementation during early development can attenuate some fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), including deficits in learning and memory. Choline is a quatranary amine, classified as a nutrient essential for human health. It acts as a methyl donor, and subserves various signaling pathways, including its role as a precursor for platelet-activating factor, sphingosylphosphocholine, diacylglycerol, and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It is not known how choline is able to mitigate alcohol-related learning deficits; however, identifying these mechanisms could contribute to the identification of additional treatments for FASD. It is hypothesized that developmental alcohol exposure induces learning and memory deficits, in part, by altering cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus, a CNS structure well-known for its role in memory function. To test this hypothesis, quantitative autoradiography was used to measure the hippocampal density of M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes that bind acetylcholine. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were orally intubated with ethanol (5.25 mg/kg/day) from postnatal days (PD) 4 to 9, a period of brain development equivalent to the human 3rd trimester; controls received sham intubations. From PD 4 to 30, subjects were injected s.c. with choline chloride (100 mg/kg/day) or saline vehicle. After behavioral testing from PD 31 to 33, brain tissue was collected on PD 35 for autoradiographic analysis. Data from the binding studies indicate that early developmental alcohol exposure increases the expression of M1 and M2 receptors. Furthermore, choline supplementation attenuates the ethanol-related increase of muscarinic receptors to a level not significantly different from that of control subjects; choline had no effect on muscarinic receptors among controls. These data suggest that perinatal alcohol exposure can cause long-lasting changes in the development of the cholinergic system; specifically, it may lead to reductions in cholinergic release and consequent upregulation of muscarinic receptor expression. This study further shows that choline supplementation may be attenuate alcoholrelated behavioral changes by normalizing cholinergic function, possibly by increasing the availability of choline for acetylcholine synthesis.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a wide range of abnormalities including defects in stress axis function. One of the possible mechanisms of alcohol's effect is epigenetic reprogramming causing abnormal DNA methylation in the key genes regulating the stress response such as proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene. In previous work we have demonstrated the hypermethylation of the promoter region of the POMC gene and consequent decrease in the POMC gene expression in the hypothalamus of rats prenatally exposed to alcohol. Also, the affected rats showed significant increase in stress axis response manifested by the elevated level of plasma corticosterone. In order to verify that the alcohol effect is mediated by the methylation changes we supplemented maternal diet with the methylation donor choline. The data of pregnant rats fed with liquid diet containing ethanol or choline-supplemented diet containing ethanol were compared with the rats fed a control diet with and without choline. The methylation status of the proximal POMC promoter was determined by Real-Time PCR using the probes specific to the methylated and unmethylated state of the promoter region. The stress axis response was determined by measuring basal and LPS-induced corticostrone levels in plasma. The choline supplementation reversed the aberrant DNA methylation in the hypothalamic POMC promoter and normalized the POMC gene expression in the offspring. It also restored the plasma corticosterone level and stress hyperresponse back to the norm. These results show support that an aberrant methyl metabolism plays an important role in the epigenetic changes caused by fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been shown to cause abnormality in stress axis function in the offspring. Fetal alcohol exposed rat offspring shows increased corticosterone production and the hormone response to immune challenge such as lipopolysaccaride (LPS). However, it is not known whether these abnormal changes of basal and LPS-stimulated corticosterone levels is transmitted to next generations. To determine the trangenerational effect, we exposed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats to alcohol during gestational day 7 and 21 and produced F1 offspring. Then both male and female F1 rats were mated with the animals born from a different dam but fed a similar diet to obtain the F2 generation. A third generation (F3) was derived from a cross of the 2 similarly treated F2 rats from different dams. These rats were used to determine the basal and LPS-stimulated corticosterone levels in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the fetal alcohol exposure increased basal plasma level of corticosterone in both male and female rats during adulthood. Additionally, the LPS-induced corticosterone level was much higher in alcohol-fed than in control-fed rats. Interestingly, a higher corticosterone response to LPS was observed in the alcohol-fed female rats than in alcohol-fed male rats. The increased basal and LPS-induced corticosterone levels in alcohol-fed male offspring persisted for both F2 and F3 generations. However, alcohol-fed female offspring showed normal basal and LPS-induced corticosterone levels in F2 and F3 generation. These results suggest that fetal alcohol exposure increases stress axis hyperresponse both in male and females offspring. Furthermore, because the offspring (F1) and its germ cells (F2) were exposed to alcohol during development via F0 female, the persistence of alcohol effects in the F3 male but not in the F3 female indicates that the transgenerational effect of fetal alcohol is transmitted via male germ line.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure often results in neurodevelopmental deficit and growth retardation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The penetration and outcome of the alcohol exposure however is depending on multifactorial environment and genetic interaction which is not well understood. Here, we demonstrated that three strains of mice, C57BL/6N (C57), DBA2 (D2), and 129, have great scale of heterogeneous response to same dose of alcohol at same embryonic stage. All strains of mice were analyzed in whole embryo culture at gestation day 8.25 (E8.25) with or without alcohol administration at 88 mM for 6 hours in the initial stage. The embryos harvested two days from initial culture were evaluated for growth rate using Van Farby scoring system and for apoptotic marker caspase 3 staining. We found that forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, heart, optic vesicle, caudal neural tube, and hindlimbs of C57BL/6J were delayed in growth, while forebrain and optic vesicle did in D2, and none in 129, as compared to their controls respectively. Caspase3, an intermediate apoptotic marker, staining showed that large number of caspase 3-immunostaining (im) cells were found in parietal forebrain, midbrain, rhombencephalon, as well as in none-neural regions e.g. head, 1st and 2nd brachial arches in alcohol treated C57 embryos, only a few were found in corresponding regions of their controls. In contract, only a small number of caspase 3-im cells were found in either the alcohol treated or the controls of the D2 embryo. Similar caspase 3-im scale to D2 were found in 129 embryos, except minor increase in the dorsal optic vesicle, and VII & VIII cranial ganglia, and somites of the alcohol-treated. These observations indicated that mouse strains with different genetic background were response to alcohol in distinctive different manner. The alcohol-resistant strains, D2 and 129 may have genetic or epigenetic makeup, which differ to C57 and were protected against alcohol insult.

N2  - We have previously reported significant reductions in femoral and tibial bone strength in fetal lambs (Ramadoss et al. 2006) following weekly binge-like alcohol exposure (1.75 g/kg, delivered to timed-pregnant ewes as a 40% [w/v] alcohol/0.9% saline solution, via 60-min daily IV infusion, in a 3-day-on/4-day-off pattern, from gestational day [GD] 4 until GD 132; term=GD 147) in an ovine model of human binge alcohol-consumption throughout gestation. The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of alcohol on fetal hind-leg bone development and mechanical properties when the same binge-exposure regimen was restricted solely to the human third-trimester-equivalent (GD 109 - 132). In addition to the third-trimester alcohol treatment group, two other groups were included for comparison: an untreated, normal-control group, and a saline-control group, which received 0.9% saline at a rate and volume equivalent to that of the alcohol group on a per-kilogram basis, and which served as a control for nutrition, instrumentation, and infusion volume. On GD 133, ewes from each of the three treatment groups were euthanized and hind-leg bones were collected from fetuses. Fetal femoral and tibial dimensions were measured and the maximum strength (MPa) carried by the bone tissue was determined using a three-point bending procedure. Fetal lambs from the alcohol-exposed group had significantly reduced femoral and tibial bone lengths than the normal-and saline-control groups, which did not differ significantly from each other on these or any other measures. Third-trimester alcohol-exposure resulted in significant reductions in tibial bone strength and anterior-posterior diameter relative to controls; similar treatment effects were not apparent for femoral bones. No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups for maximum breaking force, bone stiffness or crosssectional moment-of-inertia (CSMI). These results indicate that binge-like alcohol-exposure restricted to the human third-trimester-equivalent period of fetal development differentially alters tibial and femoral bone development in the sheep.

N2  - Alcohol exposure during fetal development poses a risk of subsequent neuroanatomical abnormalities in the brain. Human MRI studies indicate that fetal alcohol exposure can cause developmental abnormalities of the corpus callosum, and that certain patterns of morphological abnormalities of the corpus callosum may be related to specific learning disability profiles. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in midsagittal area of the corpus callosum would be evident in an ovine model of fetal alcohol exposure, in which pregnant ewes received IV infusions of alcohol (1.75 g/kg) or saline in a 3-day-on/4-day-off weekly binge pattern. Lambs from normal control, saline, first-trimester-only alcohol-exposure, and all-three-trimester alcohol-exposure groups were killed at 5 months age; brains were fixed in situ via intra-carotid perfusion. Brains were extracted and transected along the mid-sagittal plane, and both forebrain hemispheres were placed sagittal-side down on a clear surface supported at a fixed distance above a digital camera. Brains were then illuminated and photographed from below, at the same zoom level and fixed distance between the camera and brain, yielding digital images for unbiased comparison of callosal area. Image analysis software was used to precisely outline the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum in each hemisphere, with care taken to discriminate between white matter of the corpus callosum and white matter of the fornix. The cross-sectional outline was subdivided to obtain standardized measures (Witelson 1989) of length, total area, and areas of seven regional subdivisions (rostrum, genu, rostral body, anterior midbody, posterior midbody, isthmus and splenium). Although preliminary analyses with limited statistical power failed to reveal significant differences between the prenatal treatment groups, results suggest a tendency toward smaller total mid-sagittal areas in brains from alcohol-exposed lambs. Further development of these methods with more subjects may permit modeling of human alcohol-induced callosal dysmorphology in the sheep.

N2  - We previously reported that ethanol exposure or acidemia during the third trimester equivalent of human brain growth lowers both maternal and fetal plasma levels of glutamine and glutamine related amino acids. We also reported differential vulnerability to oxidative stress among fetal brain regions, with the cerebellum exhibiting increased oxidative stress in response to ethanol compared to other brain regions. Oxidative stress is widely regarded as a mediator of neurodevelopmental injury from prenatal alcohol exposure and it has been suggested that alcohol increases reactive oxygen species levels and reduces endogenous anti-oxidant levels. Glutamine is a major precursor for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione, the main molecule in the control of antioxidant status in the brain. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the end product of lipid peroxidation, and is commonly used as a marker of oxidative stress. We hypothesized that ethanol and acidemia would increase oxidative stress, with glutamine supplementation ameliorating this effect. Alcohol (1.75 g/kg) or saline was given IV over 1 hour; glutamine was given (30 mg/kg) as an IV bolus at the start of the hour. Acidemia was induced by increasing the fractional inspired concentration of carbon dioxide to match the pH change in the ethanol group. The experiment was done on GD 132, a period of high cerebellar vulnerability, and animals were sacrificed 24 hours later. Fetal brains were flash frozen at-80degreeC to prevent oxidation. Free MDA concentrations were determined using a commercially available MDA assay kit (Bioxytech MDA-586TM). Tissues were processed in presence of 15 [A of BHT to prevent oxidation. Free MDA was not significantly different between groups. We previously reported a significant increase in cerebellar free MDA concentration in response to ethanol when cerebella were harvested immediately at the end of alcohol treatment. Unlike our previous study, in this study we sacrificed animals 24 hours after the experiment to characterize the effect on fetal oxidative stress over a longer period of time. We conclude that prenatal alcohol exposure causes an increase in fetal cerebellar oxidative stress, evident by the increase in free MDA level in ethanol receiving groups (p < 0.05) over a period of 24 hours, the free MDA binds to proteins or forms adducts with DNA, as it has been reported for various different tissues.

N2  - Background: Detection of the newborn exposed to alcohol in utero is essential for early intervention in this high risk population. Previous studies have shown that fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), non-oxidative metabolites of alcohol, in meconium are a useful biomarker of prenatal exposure to alcohol in both term and preterm newborns. Despite this information, there is limited data on the effect of diet on the relative amount and profile of FAEEs. Objective: To determine if different diets containing different fatty acids, alter the FAEE profile in tissues. Design/Methods: Adult C57BI/6J female mice were separated into 3 groups to receive different diets with differing profiles of fatty acids: hydrogenated cottonseed oil, corn oil, or menhaden oil. All groups of mice were fed the same calories, same amount of fat, but different fatty acids. The mice were fed these diets for 20 days (time needed to reach steady state of the different fatty acids in total fats). After steady state was reached, half the mice in each diet group received either saline or alcohol (dose of 0.015 ml/g of 25% ethanol - two doses, four hours apart) intraperitoneally and sacrificed one hour after second dose. Brain, liver, and heart were analyzed for fatty acid ethyl esters using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. Results: Our preliminary data has shown that there is a statistically significant difference in the total fatty acid ethyl esters in ETOH versus control animals. The increase in fatty acid ethyl esters between the groups fed ETOH versus control was particularly noticeable in the liver samples. In addition, there also seems to be a difference in the fatty acid ethyl esters profiles between animals fed different diets (i.e. corn oil vs. menhaden oil - p = 0.034 with higher fatty acid ethyl esters noted in liver samples of corn oil diet fed animals). Conclusions: Preliminary data shows that ETOH fed animals have a higher concentration of FAEEs than control animals and that different diets may potentially have an affect on the FAEE profile.

N2  - Introduction: Although prenatal alcohol exposure is often associated with a unique pattern of dysmorphic facial features (e.g., midfacial hypoplasia, short palpebral fissures), little is known about longitudinal changes in these features over the course of development. In a Cape Town, South African sample with variable alcohol exposure, we examined whether facial anthropometric measurements changed over a 4-year interval, and if facial measurements predicting alcohol exposure remained consistent across time. Methods: Data on 22 standard anthropometric landmarks were obtained from 3D facial images. The initial sample consisted of 15 children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 15 with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (HE), and 15 born to alcohol abstinent mothers (controls). 16 standard anthropometric features were measured at an average age of 5.0 years and 4 years later at 9.0 years. Logistic regression was used to identify a set of anthropometric measurements that optimally classified the sample at each time point. ANOVA was employed to compare relative growth of these features between the groups. Results: At both ages, lower facial depth alone distinguished FAS from controls (Age 5: sensitivity=86%, specificity=83%; Age 9: sensitivity=87%, specificity=93%). Correct classification was substantially lower at both ages when comparing HE and controls. At age 5, bitragal width was the only predictor with 70% sensitivity and 79% specificity. At age 9, nasal bridge length was the only predictor with 60% sensitivity and specificity. The FAS group demonstrated more relative growth compared to the HE group for outer canthal, palpebral fissure (p = 0.07), nasal length, lower facial height and total facial height (p = 0.023). The HE group exhibited more relative growth compared to the controls for minimal frontal, bizygomatic, bigonial, and inner canthal widths; upper, mid, and lower facial depths, and ear length. Conclusion: Anthropometric measures that correctly identify prenatal alcohol exposure in a homogeneous age group differ across age, which could be partially due to "catch-up" growth. Furthermore, different measures provide optimal classification when distinguishing FAS or HE from controls. These results support the clinical observation that FAS facial features become more subtle as the affected individuals age.

N2  - Dysmorphic facial features are one potential consequence of exposure to alcohol during human fetal development. Facial dysmorphology is a requisite feature for diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and is presently the most well-accepted means for identifying children with FAS. The purpose of this study was to assess whether prenatal alcohol exposure induces facial dysmorphology in our ovine model of prenatal alcohol exposure, by applying standard anthropometric facial measurements that have been shown to successfully classify FAS in a clinical sample. Time-pregnant ewes were assigned to one of four treatment groups: normal control, saline control, alcohol exposed during first trimester (gestational day [GD] 4-41), or alcohol exposure during all three trimesters (GD 4-132). Alcohol was administered as a 1.75 g/kg IV dose (infused over 60 minutes) in a 3-day-on/4-day off binge pattern, and 17 standard anthropometric features were measured on postnatal day 4. All data from the alcohol exposed lambs were combined for the current analysis. ANOVA was used to test if the 17 measurements were different between treatment groups and logistic regression was employed to identify a set of anthropometric measurements that optimally classified the sample. Only two measurement means (nasal bridge and lower facial height) were different between the alcohol-exposed and normal control groups. However, logistic regression successfully classified the alcohol-exposed from normal controls (sensitivity=81%, specificity=78%), based on bigonial width, lower facial depth, and nasal bridge length. Classification of alcohol-exposed from saline controls demonstrated approximately the same sensitivity but less accurate specificity (44%). These results demonstrate that the identification of prenatal alcohol exposure in this sheep model is effective using standard anthropometric facial measures, even when the single measurement averages were not different between the treatment groups. These findings provide evidence that the sheep model exhibits a facial dysmorphology phenotype, in addition to the previously demonstrated neuroanatomical and neurobehavioral deficits, confirming that this ovine model of prenatal alcohol exposure includes the key phenotypes of FAS.

N2  - Diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is difficult due to lack of distinct facial dysmorphic feature described in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Study in humans, using anthropomorphic facial measurements has begun to discriminate subtle difference against maternal drinking history. A parallel mouse facial model is also being studied with definitive information on dose and timing of alcohol exposure. In this study, we further study the craniofacial bone facial dysmorphology over time with goal of better identification of FASD phenotypes. Alcohol induced craniofacial bone dysmorphology in postnatal day 7 (P7) and 21 (P21) C57BL/6J mice were longitudinally studied, using micro-CT scanning and 3D linear measurements. Pregnant dams were administered liquid diet or ad libitum chow from embryonic day 7 (E7) to (E16). Four treatment groups were examined (CHOW, ALC-PF [prepregnancy alcohol and pregnancy isocaloric pair-fed], PF-PF [pre-and pregnancy pair-fed], and ALC-ALC [pre-and pregnancy alcohol]). All delivered pups were culled to 6/litter and surrogate fostered. Three dimensional microCT imaging was performed at P7 and P21, and 15 anthropometric 3D linear measures were collected. Data was examined by ANAOVA, and Logistic Regression to discern features that predict alcohol exposure with high accuracy. At P7, two width measurements (minimal frontal and inner canthal) showed significant alcohol induced differences comparing Alc-Alc to PF controls. Using Logistic Regression, at P7, 74% of the ALC-ALC mice vs 83% of the PF controls (PF-PF, and ALC-PF) were correctly predicted using two width measurements (inner canthal and minimal frontal). Similar prediction rates were achieved at P21 but with three different widths (minimal frontal, bigonial, inner orbital width). Current data indicates that alcohol induced craniofacial bone dysmorphology provides further information either independently or in conjunction with facial feature analysis to diagnosis for FASD. Further studies are in progress to delineate regional bone deformation in consequence of alcohol exposure.

N2  - Introduction: Craniofacial bone dysmorphology is an important but under explored diagnostic feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). To further understand the developmental consequences of alcohol exposure, this study was designed with the following objective: Identify the effect of alcohol exposure on underlying cranial facial bone growth in a mouse model, while taking into consideration the individual volume variation of the craniofacial region characterized by the centroid size of 17 manually labeled cranial facial bone landmarks. Methods: Three treatments of C57BL/6J dams, CHOW, ALC-PF (pre-pregnancy alcohol exposure and at-pregnancy isocaloric pair-fed), and ALC-ALC (pre-and at-pregnancy alcohol exposure) were studied. The Micro-CT scan yielded volumetric data for each mouse sample with 40x40x40 um3 voxel spacing. Pups born to all treated dams were scanned at postnatal 7 day (P7) and at P21 for longitudinal studies of craniofacial bone development. Using Amira Software,17 landmarks on the craniofacial bone surfaces were defined and the frontal, parietal, occipital and jaw bones were segmented. The centroid size of 17 landmarks and the volumes of the four bones were computed and analyzed using general linear model with SPSS 17.0 to examine effect of alcohol disposure on craniofacial bone development. Results: At P21, the most prominent patterns appeared when the centroid size was not involved as a covariate: ALC-ALC showed significantly less bone development (p < 0.001) in frontal, parietal and occipital regions than ALC-PF and CHOW, while the latter two groups did not differ in frontal, pariental or jaw bone volumes. At P7, group differences were detected by fewer measures. The centroid size at both P7 and P21 stages was significantly smaller (p < 0.003) in ALC-ALC than ALC-PF and CHOW, but was similar between the ALC-PF and CHOW groups. Conclusion: These results validate our hypothesis that at-pregnancy alcohol exposure has a significant impact on reducing craniofacial bone development after birth. And, the retardation of the craniofacial bone growth was exacerbated by age. Further studies will help delineate effects of quantity and frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure on craniofacial bone dysmorphology to enable diagnosis of FASD.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which includes a spectrum of cognitive, behavioral, and structural developmental deficits. Diagnosis of Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the more severe form of FASD, depends, in part on a distinct set of abnormal facial features (smooth philtrum, short palpebral fissures, thin upper vermilion). FASD children often exhibit no, or a subset, of facial features and clinical diagnosis is not reliable. Resent studies using 2D morphometry and discrimant analysis using C57BL/6 mouse embryos demonstrated how alcohol exposure produces a specific set of abnormal facial features that may assist in diagnosis of FASD with partial phenotypes. To improve facial recognition methods in a mouse model we analyzed facial dysmorphology using a 3D volume rendering methodology. We exposed C57BL/B6J dams (B6J) with alcohol (Alc) consisting of 4.8% (v/v) in a liquid diet for 16 days pre-pregnancy, chow and water diet during mating, and the alcohol liquid diet reinstated on gestational days 7(E7) to E17. Treatment controls included a pair-fed (PF) group and an ad lib access to chow and water (Chow). We established a computational analysis of facial feature using a detection algorithm to test the divergence of facial dysmorphology between treatment groups. Using micro-video digitization, high-resolution mouse micro-video facial images were acquired for a total of 30 mouse E17 embryos from each treatment group. The digitalized images were collected from a series of fixed camera angles with images taken from a sequence of 100 camera angles, which were stacked into a video volume. Using a feature extraction approach and video volume for classification of embryonic mouse images with treatments separated into alcohol exposed and normal (control) groups, we show prediction results for the 30 Leave-One-Out cross validation test with an overall classification rate is 86.75%. Visualization of the feature points, selected by the feature analysis algorithm, on the surface mapped to the original mouse shows that critical areas of the face that contribute to the alcohol effect focus on the eye and the mid-face regions. We suggest that 3D modeling of alcohol exposed mouse embryos will assist in defining facial features in FASD where partial dysmorphology subsets can be used to predict alcohol exposure with significant accuracy.

N2  - Prevention of alcohol use is difficult thus therapies that ameliorate alcohol's damage are desirable. The severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) increases with parity, implying the depletion of a protective maternal factor. Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency and causes neurodevelopmental deficits that parallel FASD. We hypothesized that moderate maternal ID exacerbates alcohol-induced associative learning impairments and tested this in offspring of iron-sufficient (IS) or ID rat dams using cerebellumdependent eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC) and hippocampus-and amygdala-dependent fear conditioning. We exposed pups to 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg/day alcohol during the brain growth spurt via gastric gavage (postnatal days 4-9; P4-9). ID dams had a subclinical ID and were not anemic. In contrast, ID offspring were anemic at P10 and had normalized with dietary repletion by adolescence. During adolescence, ID significantly exacerbated alcohol-induced associative learning deficits measured using ECC. Alcohol-exposed ID pups had values for CR frequency and amplitude that were~30% of the responses in ID-only or alcohol-only animals. In addition, the ID-alcohol combination significantly impaired outcomes in cued and contextual fear conditioning. However, the ID-alcohol combination did not affect motor coordination. To determine whether cellular losses were associated with the ECC behavioral deficits we examined cerebellar proliferation and apoptosis at P10. ID and alcohol did not alter proliferation; however, ID significantly increased alcohol-induced apoptosis 2-fold in comparison to IS animals of the same alcohol dose. This is the first study to show that subclinical maternal ID profoundly and specifically exacerbates alcohol's effects on associative learning in the offspring. We propose that maternal iron status is an important modulator of fetal neurobehavioral outcome following alcohol exposure. Increased monitoring and treatment of ID in at-risk pregnancies may ameliorate damage to the fetus.

N2  - Alcohol dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of alcohol. Expression of 3 alleles at the ADH1B locus results in enzymes that differ in turnover rate and affinity for alcohol. The ADH1B*3 allele, which appears to be unique to African Americans, is associated with more rapid alcohol metabolism than the more prevalent ADH1B*1 allele. We and others have previously demonstrated that the presence of at least one maternal ADH1B*3 allele confers a protective effect against alcohol teratogenicity in African American infants and children (McCarver et al.,1997; Jacobson et al., 2006; Arfsten et al., 2004; but cf. Stoler et al., 2002). This study was conducted to determine whether the maternal ADH1B*3 allele continues to be protective in alcohol-exposed individuals during adolescence. 186 adolescents and 167 mothers participating in the 14-year follow-up of the Detroit Longitudinal Cohort had been genotyped for ADH1B alleles. The frequencies of the ADH1B*3 allele were 17.6% in the mothers and 21.0% in the adolescents, which are consistent with the 22% expected for the African American population. Confirming previous studies, prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with reduced head circumference and increased attention problems and externalizing behaviors in adolescents born to mothers with two ADH1B*1 alleles but not in those whose mothers had at least one ADH1B*3 allele. By contrast, the presence of an ADH1B*3 in the adolescent did not protect against any fetal alcohol-related deficits at this age. Moreover, the presence of at least one ADH1B*3 allele in the adolescent was associated with alcohol-related deficits in executive function and arithmetic calculation that were not seen in adolescents with two ADH1B*1 alleles. No differences in pregnancy alcohol intake were found in mothers with the ADH1B*3 allele. This study demonstrates that the protective effects of the maternal ADH1B*3 allele continue to be evident during adolescence and suggests that differences in alcohol metabolism genes may help account for individual differences in the vulnerability of offspring to the effects of fetal alcohol exposure. The protective effect of the maternal ADH1B*3 allele may be due to the more rapid metabolism of alcohol that it confers on the mother, which presumably results in a reduction of the peak blood alcohol concentration to which the fetus is exposed during each drinking episode.

N2  - Introduction: Early Primary School Outcomes Associated with Children's Prenatal Exposure to Alcohol and Tobacco from the Better Beginnings, Better Futures Study is a secondary analysis of a longitudinal data set. The study explores data related to child outcomes of children with mothers who were high-risk drinkers or smokers or both. These findings demonstrate the importance of collecting information about the use of multiple substances during pregnancy to avoid inappropriate conclusions if no information is collected on the other substances. Objectives: The analysis demonstrates the relationships between prenatal exposure to alcohol and nicotine separately and in combination on developmental outcomes in young children over the first four years of primary school. Methods: Measures in five domains of child development outcomes were analyzed: general development, cognitive development/academic performance, social/emotional functioning, physical health, and behaviour problems. Analyses were designed to determine whether prenatal exposure to alcohol and/or nicotine may have differential effects on these aspects of children's functioning during the early primary school years. The analyses were carried out on a longitudinal data set comprised of over 400 children. Results: The results indicated that children whose mothers reported high-risk alcohol consumption during pregnancy, showed long-term negative outcomes on measures of school performance and behaviour problems and were accentuated in children whose mothers also reported smoking during the pregnancy. Conclusions: These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal high-risk drinking and smoking may be linked to cognitive and social development at critical periods in children's development with lifelong consequences.

N2  - Background: Previous research has documented a high rate of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Consistent with this finding, alcohol-exposed children demonstrate impairments on laboratory-based sustained attention tasks and increased levels of hyperactivity based on subjective (parent) reports. However, few studies have investigated objective measures of hyperactivity in alcoholexposed children. The current study aimed to examine hyperactivity in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and their typically developing peers by measuring overt motor movements during a challenging sustained attention task. Methods: This study used the QuotientTM ADHD System, a novel technique validated for use in the clinical assessment of ADHD by providing objective measurements of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. Participants included 51 children between the ages of 6 to 16. Two groups were included: those with known histories of prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n=20), and age-and sex-matched controls (CON, n=31). Children completed a 15 to 20 minute continuous performance task in which they were asked to push a button to respond to target shapes while ignoring non-target shapes. While engaged in the task, children's head movements were measured using an infrared motion tracking system and spherical reflectors attached to their foreheads. Measurements of motor activity and attention during the task were obtained, and one-way ANOVA techniques were used to compare differences between groups. Results: ALC children made more omission errors, had longer response latencies, and greater response variability during the task compared to their CON peers. In addition, they had a greater number of head movements and showed increased frequency of movement. Measures of total task accuracy and commission errors were not statistically different between groups. Groups also did not differ in duration of immobility, or in the total displacement, size/shape, or overall complexity of their movements. Conclusions: Compared to CON children, ALC participants demonstrated increased hyperactivity and inattention during a sustained attention task. This pattern of performance is consistent with that seen in similar studies of children with ADHD, and suggests that the QuotientTM ADHD System may be a useful technique for assessing ADHD among the alcohol-exposed population.

N2  - Heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol is known to have teratogenic effects on the developing brain, resulting in a wide range of neuropsychological sequelae. Among these behavioral alterations are impairments in motor performance including motor timing, gait production and delayed motor skill development. The present study investigated the control mechanisms underlying regulation of sustained isometric force production in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, which has not been previously examined. Children between 7-17 years of age with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (n=20) and typically developing control children (n=17) pressed or released a load sensitive transducer that produced a continuous force output, which was visually displayed on a computer monitor as a series of yellow dots that unfolded left-to-right with time. Pressing or releasing the load transducer controlled the vertical position of the dots on the monitor. Also displayed on the monitor was a single horizontal line that represented a criterion force of either 5 or 20% of maximal voluntary contraction. Participants were instructed to produce a force that superimposed the yellow dots on the criterion force line for the duration of the trial (20 seconds). For each force level, three levels of visual feedback frequency were used by programming the yellow dots to appear every 20 ms (50 Hz), 320 ms (3.1 Hz) and 740 ms (1.4 Hz). Five test trials were provided for the six combinations of force and feedback frequency. With age entered as a covariate, statistical analyses revealed that children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure produced significantly greater response error (root-mean-square error), response system variability (signal-to-noise ratio) and reduced response signal organization in the time domain (sample entropy) than control children. The study confirms that in utero alcohol exposure is associated with significantly decreased control of isometric force production, a finding which could be relevant to therapeutic exercises designed to ameliorate motor deficits in this clinical group.

N2  - Maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can induce a range of behavioural and cognitive deficits in offspring, which are collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). There are significant delays in motor development and sensory-motor skills in children with FASD, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these deficits are poorly understood. The goal of this research project is to test the hypothesis that the Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movements (KINARM) will serve as an effective tool for identifying and measuring specific, neurologically-based motor deficits in children with FASD. These deficits will be revealed through investigation of multi-joint upper limb movements during the performance of sensory-motor tasks (reaching and arm positionmatching tasks). Children (21 FASD; 86 Controls, aged 6 to 17 years, male and female) performed two separate tasks: (i) a visually-guided reaching task with fingertip feedback only; and (ii) an arm position-matching task in the absence of visual feedback. Children with FASD significantly differed from controls in many reaching task outcome measures, specifically those measures related to the initial motor response (distance and direction errors), corrective responses, and total movement time. In particular, exceptionally large effect sizes were observed for outcome measures related to the first (initial) movement (e.g. distance and direction error), and the total movement path length relative to the optimal path length. In the position-matching task, children with FASD constricted the spatial workspace of the subjectcontrolled arm relative to the robot-controlled arm in both the horizontal and vertical axes. The results suggest that children with FASD have difficulty integrating sensory information into planned motor movements. The KINARM is a promising research tool that may be used to assess motor control deficits in children affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) describes the continuum of adverse effects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, and attention are particularly affected in children with FASD. Eye movement tasks have proven to be a powerful tool for assessing deficits in executive function in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate aspects of executive function using a remote video-based eye tracking system in children with FASD. Children with FASD and ageand sex-matched control children performed a delayed memory-guided sequential task and a predictive task. In the delayed memory-guided sequential task, each trial began with the appearance of a central fixation point (FP) followed by the sequential appearance of two targets illuminated briefly in two of four quadrants of the screen. After a variable delay the central FP was extinguished, instructing the subject to generate two saccades to the remembered target locations in the same sequence in which they appeared. This task assessed the ability to suppress planned saccadic responses as well as working memory. In the predictive task, subjects were instructed to follow a target that alternated between two known locations in the right or left hemi-field at either specific inter-stimulus intervals of 750 ms and 1000 ms, or pseudo-randomly (interleaved trials). This task assesses the ability to adjust motor responses to a predictable sensory pattern. In the delayed memory-guided sequential task children with FASD had shorter latency SRT's, indicative of an increased frequency of timing errors. However, there were no differences between groups on the parameter of spatial working memory (correct sequence of saccades). In the predictive task, the FASD group differed from controls with respect to SRT, but not in amplitude or velocity of saccades. In contrast to the control group, SRT's within the FASD group did not differ between the fixed inter-stimulus intervals and the interleaved trials. These results suggest that subjects with FASD have difficulty using sensory information to modify the motor program. Together, these findings demonstrate that eye movement tasks can be used to assess deficits in response inhibition and sensory-motor integration in children with FASD.

N2  - Math deficits have been recognized as a specific deficit associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). In designing math remedial services for individuals with PAE, a better understanding of the underlying cognitive deficits is needed to develop appropriate compensatory strategies. The relationship between the math functioning and indices of verbal intelligence, spatial reasoning, working memory, cross-hemisphere transfer of verbal information, cross-hemisphere transfer of motoric information, and simultaneous processing of information in both hemispheres were explored within groups of young adults followed prospectively. Groups recruited prenatally consisted of individuals whose mothers did not drink during pregnancy (CON, n=59), prenatally alcohol-exposed individuals with alcoholrelated dysmorphia (DYS, n=48), and prenatally alcohol-exposed individuals without dysmorphia (EXP, n=75). An additional group with special education experience was recruited as teenagers and followed into adulthood (SPED, n=54). The DYS group performed more poorly than did CON and EXP groups on measures of math calculation and reasoning, quantitative concepts, and applied math problems, but did not differ from the SPED group. The DYS group also had more impaired math fluency than did CON group but did not differ from the EXP or SPED groups. To explore the relationship between math performance and specific cognitive skills, factor analyses using a principal components procedure with a varimax rotation were used for data reduction of the results from a comprehensive neurodevelopmental battery. Math functioning in the DYS group was more strongly related to working memory (Fisher's z=2.0, p <.05) and simultaneous processing of information in both hemispheres (Fisher's z=2.8, p <.01) than in the CON group. The SPED group showed a stronger relationship between math functioning and cross-hemisphere transfer of verbal information than the DYS group (Fisher's z=2.4, p <.05). Finally, the EXP group showed a stronger relationship between math and verbal intelligence than did the CON group (Fisher's z=2.4, p <.05). No group differences were found in the relationships between math functioning and either spatial reasoning and cross-hemisphere transfer of motoric information. These results suggests that specific aspects of alcohol teratogenesis on neurocognitive functioning impact math performance and need to be taken into account when designing math intervention programs.

N2  - Studies of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have consistently shown executive function deficits. In addition, one cross-sectional study has suggested that impairments in some aspects of executive function become more pronounced with age in this population. The goal of this project was to examine the development of executive abilities in a small longitudinal sample of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and typicallydeveloping controls. Fourteen children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) and nine non-exposed control children (CON), ages 7-14, were administered the Verbal Fluency (VF) and Trail Making (TM) tests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) twice, 1 to 5 years apart. Primary Measures included total correct responses for VF conditions (Letter Fluency, Category Fluency, Category Switching) and completion times for TM conditions (Visual Scanning, Number Sequencing, Letter Sequencing, Number-Letter Switching, Motor Speed). The difference between scaled scores was calculated to measure the rate of change relative to the norm on each of these eight Primary Measures. Scores were analyzed using analysis of variance techniques. The main effect of group was not significant, suggesting that change in performance over time on measures of VF and TM does not differ between groups. These data fail to replicate a previous cross-sectional study suggesting that children with FASD have difficulties with some executive function tasks which grow more pronounced with age. Based on this small longitudinal sample, it appears that performance on these executive function measures may develop at a rate similar in children with FASD and controls. Although children with FASD display impairments on measures of executive functioning, these impairments do not appear to worsen over time. Although our study was limited by a small sample size, it demonstrates the potential value of utilizing longitudinal techniques to address developmental changes in this population. Additional studies are needed to further examine the development of executive abilities in children with FASD.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with a continuum of neuropsychological and behavioral difficulties; the most severe outcome on this continuum is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The characteristic facial features of FAS allow identification of affected individuals. However, neuropsychological difficulties also occur in alcohol-exposed children who do not meet criteria for FAS. Because these children lack physical markers of maternal alcohol use, the link between prenatal alcohol exposure and neurobehavioral difficulties may be minimized. Clarification of a distinct neurobehavioral profile of prenatal alcohol exposure could aid in identification of alcohol-exposed children and lead to earlier interventions for affected individuals. In one previous investigation, latent profile analysis (LPA) was used successfully to distinguish alcohol-exposed children from controls using measures that focused primarily on executive function and spatial processing. The current study sought to extend this work by including a broader range of neuropsychological domains. A standardized neuropsychological test battery was administered individually to 174 children ages 6-16 with heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol but not FAS (n=63) and typically developing controls (n=111) and data were analyzed with LPA. To maximize power, 17 measures were selected based on their ability to distinguish between groups. Variables included measures of language, executive function, academic achievement, fine motor skills, visuomotor integration, learning, memory, and attention. Results indicated that a 2-class model best fit the data. Model fit was determined by testing multiple class solutions (e.g. 1 vs. 2-class models) and then evaluating two fit indices, the Akaike Information Critreria and Bayesian Information Criterion. In addition, the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test for the 1 vs. 2-class solution was evaluated. The resulting profile successfully distinguished subjects with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls with 79% overall accuracy; 81.0% of alcohol-exposed cases and 77.5% of controls were correctly classified. These data build on previous work and suggest that a wide range of neuropsychological measures can be used to distinguish nondysmorphic alcohol-exposed children from typically developing controls.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure produces cognitive deficits. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of corpus callosum (CC) in alcohol exposed adults (Ma, et al, 2005; Li, et al, 2009) found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased diffusivity suggesting effects on white matter integrity. To examine the relationship between DTI outcomes and cognitive measures sensitive to hemispheric disconnection or callosal white matter loss, we evaluated 82 African-American adults who were identified prenatally as exposed to alcohol (n=66) or as controls (n=26). In 6 regions of CC, DTI measures were obtained including FA, and diffusivity, mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial (RD). Neuropsychological tests sensitive to hemispheric disconnection or callosal white matter loss were done also to examine brain/behavior relationships in the longitudinal sample with alcohol-affected performing more poorly than controls. To facilitate interpretation of the multiple significant correlations between DTI and Neuropsychological tests, data reduction (factor analyses) was carried out for the following tests: Motor and visual/motor functioning: Finger Localization, Perdue Peg Board; Visual and auditory processing: Visual Alexia, Dichotic Listening; Memory and Attention: Weschler Memory Scale, Spatial Span, Subject Oriented Pointing, Verbal and Nonverbal Recall and Delayed Recall. This yielded 4 factors labeled based on the process measured by the tests loading on factors: Working Memory, Visual/Spatial Processing, and Cross Callosal Transfer Factors 1 and 2. The first three factors were found to correlate positively with FA and negatively with diffusivity from different CC regions as follows: Working Memory and FA-Isthmus, r=.20, p < 0.07, MD-Isthmus, r=-.23, p < 0.03, RD-Isthmus, r=-.25, p < 0.02, Visual/Spatial Skills, FA-Rostrum, r=.20, p < 0.06, MD-Isthmus, r=-.238, p <.03, RD, r=-.22, p <.05, Cross-Callosal Transfer 1: FA: Genu, r=.195, p =.08, MD-Genu, r=-.34, p < 0.002, MD-Rostrum, r=-.31, p < 0.005, MD-Splenium, r=-.23, p < 0.04, AD-Genu,-.35, p < 0.001, AD Rostrum, r=-.39, p < 0.001, AD-Anterior Midbody, r=-.27, p < 0.02, AD-Splenium, r=-.31, p < 0.005, RD-Genu,-.26, p < 0.02. Thus, as predicted, cognitive and behavioral functions impaired in alcohol-exposed individuals are significantly correlated with measures of white matter and axonal integrity suggesting a basis for some of the observed behavioral deficits in this population.

N2  - The impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on memory and brain volume was investigated in 92 African-American, young adults first identified in the prenatal period. Three groups were included to provide a spectrum of the effects of prenatal exposure (Controls, n=26; ARND, n=36; and Dysmorphic, n=30). It was hypothesized that prenatal exposure would be associated with both reduced brain volume and poorer memory performance and that individuals demonstrating the physical effects of alcohol exposure (Dysmorphic) would show most impairment. Further, it was hypothesized that a relationship between volume reduction in specific brain regions (i.e. Medial Temporal and Frontal) would be demonstrated. For each participant, T1-weighted images were obtained on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Magnetom TRIO scanner with an MPRAGE sequence (TR=2600 ms, TE=3.02 ms, Flip Angle=8degree, voxel size=1x1x1 mm3). FreeSurfer software was used to segment sub-cortical structures, grey and white matters, and cortical regions. Volumetric data for the cortical and sub-cortical regions of interest were also calculated with FreeSurfer3. Memory was measured using the Verbal Selective Reminding Test (VSRT) (Buschke & Fuld, 1974) and its nonverbal counterpart, the Nonverbal Selective Reminding Test (NVSRT) (Fletcher, 1985) which each yielding measures of recall and learning slope. Results: Alcohol exposed individuals demonstrated significantly lower total brain volume (F(2.89)=3.82, p <.03) than controls as well as lower volume in a number of regions including hippocampus (F(2.89)=3.91 p < 0.02). For both Verbal (p < 0.003; p < 0.007) and Nonverbal (p < 0.002: p < 0.01) recall and learning slope, linear trends were observed demonstrating a spectrum of deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Further, Dysmorphic individuals performed significantly less well than unexposed controls on 7 of 8 memory outcomes even when ability level (IQ) was controlled. Mediation analysis (Baron & Kenny, 1986) indicted that the effects on memory of the physical characteristics associated with prenatal exposure were mediated through hippocampal volume, particularly right hippocampus, (Verbal Recall, z=2.25, p < 0.02; Spatial Recall, z=1.97, p< 0.05) and through the anterior frontal lobe (Verbal Recall, z=2.11, p < 0.04). These results confirm our hypotheses and suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure has persistent effects on brain and on cognitive functions which are mediated by specific brain regions.

N2  - Volume of caudate nucleus but not hippocampus has been shown to be affected by fetal alcohol exposure (Archibald et al. 2001; Astley et al., 2009); both studies used manual tracing. Volumes of caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were measured using tracing by a senior neuroanatomist (CW) and FreeSurfer, an automated brain segmentation program. Structural MRI data were obtained from 32 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) school-age children at 11.6 years (range=9.7-13.7) on a Siemens 3T Allegra scanner. 13 were heavily alcohol exposed, and 19 had mothers who abstained or drank at low levels during pregnancy. Five were diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and 8 were heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE). Inter-observer reliabilities for the manual tracing ranged from r=.94-.99, Median=.98. Manual tracing was highly correlated with FreeSurfer volumes, rs ranged from.74 for right hippocampus to.89 for total caudate, Median=.83. Frequency of alcohol use during pregnancy was related to smaller volumes based on both tracing (caudate, r=-.44, p =.01; corpus callosum, r=-.38, p <.05; hippocampus, r=-.32, p =.07) and automated segmentation (caudate, r=-.39, p >.05; corpus callosum, r=-.40, p <.025; hippocampus, r=-.36, p <.05) as well as smaller total intracranial volume (TIV; r=-.51, p<.01). There was a dose-dependent relation of diagnostic group to volumes of the three brain structures and TIV. Caudate, corpus callosum, and TIV were significantly smaller in the FAS group than HE and controls, and hippocampus was smaller in FAS than controls. Partial correlation was used to examine the degree to which the relation of fetal exposure with brain structure volume continued to be evident after adjustment for TIV. The relation of prenatal alcohol to caudate and corpus callosum volume was no longer significant but continued to be evident after control for TIV; by contrast, hippocampal volume was clearly no longer related to exposure. This study, which is the first to use FreeSurfer to examine brain structure in fetal alcohol exposed children, demonstrates the validity of this automated segmentation methodology, which is substantially more time-and cost-efficient than manual tracing. These data are also consistent with previous reports that caudate is disproportionately vulnerable to fetal alcohol exposure, whereas hippocampus is relatively spared.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) produces physiological and behavioural abnormalities that are consistent with altered serotonin (5-HT) function in male rats. Whether alterations in the 5-HT system persist into adulthood and are present in females remains unknown. Objectives: We investigated: 1) the effects of PAE on the number of 5-HT neurons in the brainstem in female adult rats; 2) the potential influence of ovarian sex steroids, estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) on this population of 5-HT neurons. Methods: Female offspring from prenatal ethanol (PAE), pair-fed (PF) and ad lib-fed control (C) dams were studied in adulthood. Females were assigned to the following groups: 1) ovariectomized (OVchi); 2) ovariectomized with estradiol replacement (OVX+E2; mean plasma concentration: 64 pg/ml); 3) ovariectomized and replaced with estradiol (as above) and progesterone (OVchi+E2+P4; mean plasma concentration for P4:12 ng/ml); 4) Sham surgery (SHAM). Immunocytochemistry for 5-HT was performed. Results: PAE decreased the number of 5-HT-ir neurons in the dorsal raphe (DR) in OVchi females. There was no effect of PAE the number of DR 5HT-ir neurons in OVchi+E2 group, suggesting a possible neuroprotective role of estradiol in PAE animals. Treatment with both progesterone and estradiol compared to estradiol alone caused a further decrease in number of DR 5-HT-ir neurons in PAE but not C or PF animals. Conclusion: These results provide evidence of the enduring effects of PAE on the serotonergic system, and suggest a role for the ovarian sex steroids in mediating these effects.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol use in pregnancy is one of the few modifiable risk factors for poor pregnancy and child outcomes, including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Fetal alcohol exposure is one of the most common preventable causes of intellectual disability. Aims: To identify Australian women's preferred information sources, and their perceptions of health professionals' role regarding alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Methods: In 2006, via computer assisted telephone interview, we collected data from 1103 Australian women (69% participation) of childbearing age (18-45 years), including their preferred information sources, and the role of health professionals regarding alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Results: Half the participants had seen information about the effects of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. The most common sources were brochures (16%), media programmes or articles (13%), and television advertising (10%). Participants identified health professionals (52%) as the best source of information, followed by television advertisements (12%) and brochures (9%). The internet was a frequent second source of information (22%). Younger participants (18-29 years) were more likely to use the internet, family or friends, or school classes to find information; older participants (30-45 years) preferred media programmes or articles. Participants agreed that health professionals should ask pregnant women about alcohol (96.9%), should advise women how much alcohol is safe to drink in pregnancy (96.9%) and advise women who are thinking of becoming pregnant to give up drinking alcohol (91%). Conclusions: Australian women use a variety of information sources to learn about alcohol in pregnancy. However, in this survey they report a strong preference for health professionals to provide information to women including how much alcohol can be consumed safely in pregnancy. Strategies to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and prevent FASD should include clear guidelines for the community delivered via the preferred information sources women have identified in this survey.

N2  - Background: We have previously reported to this Society that fetal alcohol exposure during late gestation in sheep leads to endothelial dysfunction and increased stiffness in a wide range of vascular beds. Our present aim was to determine whether these effects persist into postnatal life. Method: Ethanol (0.75 g) was infused iv daily into 7 ewes, over 1 h, from 95 days to 135 days of gestation (term ~145 days). Control ewes (n = 7) received saline. The lambs were born normally and, at 8 weeks, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined in vivo. At 9 weeks the lambs were euthanised, and small (~250 lm diameter) coronary, renal, mesenteric, femoral and cerebral artery reactivity and wall stiffness were tested in vitro. Results: Endothelial relaxation was impaired in renal, femoral and mesenteric arteries from alcohol exposed lambs [P = 0.001]. Constriction was en- hanced in the femoral, and relaxation to nitroprusside impaired in renal and femoral vessels [P = 0.01]. Cerebral and coronary arteries were not affected. PWV was reduced in alcohol exposed lambs [P = 0.006], suggesting arteries were less stiff. Indeed, coronary and femoral vessels were more compliant when tested in vitro, but renal, mesenteric and cerebral arteries were stiffer following alcohol exposure. The reduction in PWV was greater in males. Conclusions: The vasodilator dysfunction identified in alcohol exposed fetuses persists postnatally in some vascular beds. In contrast, the arterial stiffness observed in alcohol-exposed fetuses is reversed, giving way to increased compliance associated with lower PWV in lambs. These permanent vascular changes in early postnatal life may lead to life long risk for vascular disease.

N2  - Background: Numerous studies have demonstrated adverse effects of high levels of alcohol during pregnancy on the developing fetal heart. However, the effects of a more moderate level of alcohol on the fetal heart are poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate the effects of a moderate level of alcohol exposure during late gestation on the development of ventricular muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). These cells undergo maturation during late gestation in humans and sheep. Method: Pregnant ewes were infused with either ethanol (0.75 g of alcohol/maternal kg) or saline from gestational days 95 to 134 (term is ~145 days). Cardiomyocyte number, size and nuclearity were determined in fixed hearts. Collagen deposition was quantified using image analysis. Genes relating to cardiomyocyte proliferation and apoptosis were examined using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Exposure to alcohol led to a significant increase in relative heart weight (9.04 +/- 0.65 vs. 7.22 +/- 0.51 g/kg body wt; p = 0.05), relative ventricular tissue volume (5.66 +/- 0.12 vs. 5.23 +/- 0.13 mm3/g; p = 0.03), cardiomyocyte cross sectional area (48.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 42.1 +/- 0.9 lm2; p = 0.02) and caspase 3 mRNA levels (1.91 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.00 +/- 0.22; p = 0.007). The alcohol exposed hearts were also found to be more mature (percentage of binucleated cardiomyocytes: 80.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 66.8 +/- 1.2; p = <0.0001). There were no significant differences in collagen deposition or c-Myc mRNA levels. Conclusions: Exposure to a moderate level of alcohol during late gestation leads to marked changes in cardiomyocyte growth and maturation which may have long-term implications.

N2  - Background: Few studies have investigated the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on the developing lung. We recently showed that alcohol exposure during the third trimester impairs the maturation and immune status of the fetal ovine lung. Our present aim was to investigate whether these alterations persist into postnatal life. Methods: Pregnant ewes were catheterized at gestational day (GD) 90 and infused daily with ethanol (0.75 g/kg i.v., n = 9) or saline (n = 7) over 1 h from GD95-135. Ewes gave birth naturally at term (~GD147). At two months after birth, lung tissue was collected and the lung parenchyma was morphometrically analyzed. Surfactant protein (SP)-A, -B, -C and -D and interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Surfactant phospholipid composition in lung lavage fluid was analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: There were no significant differences in lung tissue weight, volume and morphometry, collagen content, pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and surfactant phospholipid composition between the control and ethanol-exposed groups. SP-D mRNA levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the ethanol-exposed lambs compared to controls. Conclusions: Daily prenatal ethanol exposure during the third trimester does not significantly alter lung growth and structure at two months after birth. Although SP-D expression was not altered in the fetus, it was increased in ethanol-exposed lambs; as SP-D has immunomodulatory roles, innate immunity may be altered. As the alterations observed in the fetal lung immediately following ethanol exposure do not persist, this suggests the lung is able to repair.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which is linked to early pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction, and impaired placentation. Alcohol impairs the immune response, but its effects on the complex interactions between the feto-placental unit and the maternal immune system, which arc necessary for placentation, are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of chronic gestational exposure to alcohol on cytokine expression profiles in placenta, mesometrial triangle (MT-implantation site), amniotic fluid, and maternal serum. Design: Pregnant Long-Evans rats were fed with isocaloric liquid diets in which alcohol comprised 0% (N= 4) or 24% (N= 8) of the caloric content, starting on gestational day (GD) 6. Blood, amniotic fluid, placentae, and MT were harvested on GD 18. The samples were subjected to a bead-based multiplex ELISA, which included measurement of 11 pro-inflammatory cytokines, 5 anti-inflammatory cytokines, 5 anti-inflammatory chemokines, 1 pro-inflammatory chemokine, and 2 growth factors. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. Results: 24-plex analysis revealed that, in controls, the levels of nearly all analytes measured, except GCSF, IL-1beta, and TNF-alphafz were in higher in placenta as compared to the MT. Gestational alcohol exposure significantly reduced expression of 9 cytokines in the MT, 7 of which were pro-inflammatory in nature (IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, IP-10, and MCP-1). The 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines reduced by ethanol exposure were IL-5 and eotaxin. In contrast, VEGF was significantly elevated in the MT of alcohol-exposed dams. Alcohol exposure had no significant effect on cytokine expression profiles in placental tissue, amniotic fluid, or maternal serum. Conclusion: Chronic gestational exposure to alcohol alters cytokine expression profiles at the site of implantation. Alcohol-mediated reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are needed to promote trophoblast implantation, could represent a critical factor in the pathogenesis of impaired placentation in FASD. Moreover, increased VEGF expression could reflect persistence of non-converted maternal vessels associated with ethanol exposure.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Retrospective report (RETRO REP) of maternal alcohol consumption is thought to be "less valid" than prospective pregnancy report. Yet we recently validated RETRO REP of in-pregnancy drinking on birth size and teen behavior. We hypothesized that relations between RETRO REP and child outcome are influenced by gender. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy was assessed antenatally (ANTE) for urban African American women (N=288). At each prenatal visit, women were queried about alcohol use (absolute oz/day) during the preceding 2 weeks. At a 14-year follow-up, the same women were queried again about prior and current alcohol use. Teen behavior was assessed by teachers using the Teacher Report Form (Achenbach, 2004). RESULTS: The impact of gender on the relation between RETRO REP and birth size and teen behavior was examined using multiple regression. Analyses were stratified by gender for absolute alcohol/day (AAD) and absolute alcohol/ drinking day (AADD) across pregnancy. Analyses controlled for multiple covariates and revealed different patterns of relations between RETRO REP and outcomes by gender. Significant relations between Anxiety, Depressive symptoms and Thought Problems, and AAD and/or AADD (betas=.19,-.23, ps<.05) were found only for girls. For boys, AAD and/or AADD were related to attention and externalizing problems (i.e., Impulsivity, ODD; [betas=.19-.23, ps<.05]). Birth weight and length were related to RETRO REP AADD (betas=-.14 - -.21, p<.05) for boys only. For both genders, Somatic Problems were related to both AAD and AADD (betas= .21-.31, p<.05). ANTE report was solely related to birth size and Somatic Complaints for boys. CONCLUSION: The relation between prenatal alcohol and negative teen outcome is well established. Similar to previous report, boys exhibited more externalizing behavior, while girls exhibited more internalizing behavior in response to prenatal alcohol exposure. Importantly, our RETRO REP predicted these effects and interactions better than ANTE report providing further validation of retrospective report.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is characterized by growth deficiency and all models of intrauterine growth restriction demonstrate reductions in uterine blood flow (UBF). Pregnancy-induced increases in UBF (30 fold) are associated with elevation in eNOS expression, phosphorylation, and NO production at the level of UAECs. We hypothesized that alcohol will reduce eNOS expression and its activity by reducing eNOS phosphorylation via alterations in the signaling pathways that control eNOS activity in UAECs. UAECs from pregnant ewes (gestational day 120-130) were validated using FACS. Maternal binge drinking patterns were mimicked; UAECs (passage 4, n = 5 replicates) were treated with 0 (control), 60, 90, 120, or 150 mg/ dl of alcohol in a compensating system for 3 h on 3 consecutive days. Cell viability was validated by trypan blue microscopy, Calcein AM imaging, and caspase 3 immunoblotting. The number of viable cells between groups was not different (control, 891,250 + 11,433; alcohol, 834,000 + 49,784; P=0.73). Uncleaved caspase 3 was unaltered and cleaved caspase 3 was undetectable. Compared to control, at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl alcohol, total eNOS level was significantly reduced to 70%, 70%, 63%, and 43% respectively. p635eNOS also decreased substantially to 29%, 21%, 18%, and 15% with increasing alcohol doses. Caveolin-1, a protein associated with eNOS was significantly decreased only at the highest dose. Investigation of the ERK1/2 pathway, the major signaling cascade coupled to eNOS activation in UAECs revealed that total ERK1 was reduced to 87%, 75%, 55%, and 16% and total ERK2 was reduced to 66%, 55%, 35%, and 21%, respectively at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl alcohol. Further, pERK1 level was reduced to 57%, 32%, 29%, and 24% with increasing alcohol doses. These alterations were specific to ERK1/2 signaling in that pAKT or total AKT were not altered among groups. These data were consistent with and validated by both confocal imaging as well as high throughput proteomics. These data delineate the effects of binge alcohol on the abundance and post-translational modification via phosphorylation of eNOS and ERK1/2 enzymes in UAECs. Further, stoichiometrically disproportional levels of eNOS and caveolin-1 may influence eNOS activation. These results strongly suggest that intrauterine environment plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of FASD.

N2  - Little is known about the fetal effects of light and moderate drinking during pregnancy. Randomized trials are not possible and observational studies have problems with confounding and bias. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between maternal drinking before recognition of pregnancy/ Downloaded from rsx.sagepub.com by Michiel Schotten on June 30, 2011 Poster Session: Fetus I (Thursday, 3/25/2010, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM) 100A Reproductive Sciences Vol. 17, No. 3 (Supplement), March 2010 Scientific Abstracts early during pregnancy and children's cognitive development, using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene ADH1B as a proxy for intrauterine alcohol exposure. This was a Mendelian randomization study, based on the principle that genotypes are randomly distributed in a population and should not be associated with confounding variables or subject to reporting bias. We estimated the effect of alcohol consumption before pregnancy recognition on children's IQ tests at age 8 and school results at age 11. We used data from ALSPAC, a UK longitudinal cohort study of 14,541 pregnancies. 7,259 mother-child pairs were genotyped, with IQ available for 4,103 and school test results for 6,432 children. Using standard methods to adjust for confounding, we found that drinking before pregnancy has a positive effect on children's cognitive outcomes. However, drinking patterns are strongly related to social class, education, lifestyle and possibly to unmeasured variables. Using the Mendelian randomization approach, the relationship between alcohol consumption and children's outcomes was reversed. The effect of an increase in frequency of drinking before recognition of pregnancy was an average decrease in children's IQ scores and school test results. Any level of exposure of the fetus to alcohol before recognition of pregnancy/early during pregnancy may have detrimental effects on children's cognitive development.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Youth living with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) face particular challenges in achieving success in school, the workplace, and the wider community. Risk and protective factors each affect the youths' ability to maximize their potential, greatly influencing outcomes. There is an urgent need for an assessment tool that reflects these risk and protective factors experienced throughout their life, as well as the youths' lived experiences. The present study attempts to create an interview tool that will better assess resilience levels among young males. Methods: Focus groups comprised of the researcher, a young male living with FASD, and adults close to the young male, constructed interview questions to match the cognitive ability of the young male; questions examine early life stability, risk factors, resilience levels, world view, and temperament. Using an iterative research design, this tool will identify the effect of these and other criminogenic factors on life outcomes for predominantly urban males, 16 to 20 years of age, who are or have been involved with the justice system. Results: It is expected that this tool will greatly assist in accurately predicting the negative relationship between instability in daily living and positive life outcomes for youth living with FASD. Conclusions/Discussion: Through the use of this tool, risk factors will be better identified and processes can be implemented for early interventions with families unable to provide a stable and supportive environment for their children, particularly if their children are living with the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Objectives: Early Primary School Outcomes Associated with Children's Prenatal Exposure to Alcohol and Tobacco from the Better Beginnings, Better Futures Study is a secondary analysis of a longitudinal data set. The study explores data related to outcomes of children with mothers who were high-risk drinkers or smokers or both. Method: Measures in five domains of child development outcomes were analyzed: general development, cognitive development/ academic performance, social/emotional functioning, physical health, and behaviour problems. Analyses were designed to determine whether prenatal exposure to alcohol and/or nicotine may have differential effects on these aspects of children's functioning during the early primary school years. The analyses were carried out on a longitudinal data set comprised of over 400 children. Results: The results indicated that children whose mothers reported high-risk alcohol consumption during pregnancy, showed long-term negative outcomes on measures of school performance and behaviour problems and were accentuated in children whose mothers also reported smoking during the pregnancy. These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal high-risk drinking and smoking may be linked to cognitive and social development at critical periods in children's development with lifelong consequences. Conclusion: These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal high-risk drinking and smoking may be linked to cognitive and social development at critical periods in children's development with lifelong consequences.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) in meconium are validated biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure. In clinical practice, meconium analysis can potentially be used to identify newborns at risk for alcohol-related disabilities, who can then be followed up and assisted if any disabilities emerge. This study aims to determine whether women are willing to partake in such screening by assessingmaternal participation in a pilot neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: All Grey-Bruce women delivering at St. Joseph's Hospital were offered a screening program involving meconium analysis and long-term follow-up of positive cases. With consent, meconium was collected and tested for FAEE using validated methods. Positive cases were followed-up by a public health nurse who conducted timely developmental assessments and made referrals to appropriate intervention programs if delays emerged. The rates of voluntary participation and positivity for fetal exposure in this open screening program were then compared to the rates previously observed in this population when testing was offered anonymously. Results: Of the 55 women who were offered screening, 43 consented. Among these, one positive case was identified and is currently being followed-up by the Public Health Department. The consent rate in this open screening program is significantly lower (p<0.05) than in the previous study where testing was anonymous (78% vs. 94%, respectively), and the positivity rate is only 3%in contrast to 30% positivity rate observed with anonymous testing (p<0.01). Conclusions: Findings suggest that open screening results in lower participation and low positivity for fetal exposure. This implies that despite the potential benefits of such screening programs, maternal unwillingness to consent may severely limit the usefulness of meconium testing for large population-based open screening.

N2  - Introduction and objective: Pregnancy-and birth-related risk factors of ADHD include maternal smoking, alcohol ingestion and prematurity. We compared the correlation between these risk factors with a sample of Campanian children with ADHD. Methods: 194 ADHD subjects (DSM criteria), from 4 to 22 years old, 52.1% with ADHD combined type (ADHD-C). Data were collected using medical folders of the patients; we estimated the prevalence of maternal smoking, prenatal exposure to alcohol and low birth weight. Pearson analysis was made to estimate the association between these factors and ADHD. Results: There is a statistically significant correlation between smoking and use of alcohol during pregnancy and ADHD-C, and, in our sample, between LBW and these factors (r = 0.330; r = 0.301). Discussion: There is a correlation between the onset of ADHD and pregnancy risk factors in our population; found data are similar in frequency to the data of literature. Conclusions: Maternal smoking during pregnancy, prematurity, alcohol exposure, contribute as causes of ADHD. The analysis of a population of ADHD Campanian children put in evidence a correlation with the previous statements.

N2  - Case report:: A 16-year old girl presented after two generalized seizures for neurological assessment. At the age of 9 years fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was diagnosed based on microcephaly, characteristic facial anomalies including short palpebral fissures, thin vermilion border of the upper lip and smooth philtrum as well as postnatal growth retardation and global cognitive deficits. Neurological examination was otherwise normal. A waking state EEG showed focal slowing and focal sharp waves in the right temporal region, an EEG during sleep was normal. MRI of the brain revealed an abnormally thick cortex with bilateral polymicrogyria (PMG) in the superior frontal gyrus with asymmetric distribution. Discussion: A wide range of cerebral malformations is associated with FAS as demonstrated in both histological and neuroradiological studies. There is experimental evidence that alcohol interferes with many molecular, neurochemical and cellular events occurring during normal development of the brain. In the first month of human gestation maternal ethanol drinking is associated with a great incidence of craniofacial and neuronal tube anomalies. In the second trimester alcohol exposure reduces the number of neurons and glia cells in the neocortex and induces changes in radial glia as well as neuronal proliferation, generation, and migration. During the third trimester of gestation alcohol interferes with synaptogenesis as well as glial development, increases natural cell death and cell necrosis, and involves the impairment of neuronal cell migration. PMG in FAS has been described only in a single patient who was included in a neuropathology study in 1979. The autopsy of this patient revealed PMG in the orbital, temporal, and parieto-occipital surfaces. In our patient history, clinical features, and genetic investigations provided no evidence for any of the known genetic or acquired causes of PMG. Therefore, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of PMG in our patient rather than a mere coincidence. Conclusion: We present the 2nd patient of PMG in FAS and confirm the phenotypic variability of cerebral malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In patients with severe neurological impairment or seizures neuroimaging is recommended. Furthermore, FAS should be considered as a differenzial diagnosis for PMG.

N2  - Background: A cardinal feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), and models of IUGR demonstrate dysfunctional maternal uterine vascular adaptations including lower uterine blood flow and decreased angiogenesis. This altered remodeling is mediated in part by estrogen, which is significantly elevated during gestation. Further, estrogen specifically induces ovine pregnant uterine artery endothelial cell (P-UAEC) proliferation. Hypothesis: In this study, we hypothesized that there exists an interaction between estrogen and alcohol on ovine P-UAEC proliferation. Methods: P-UAECs were isolated from pregnant ewes(gestationalday120-130; term= 147), FACS sorted, validated, and maintained in culture to passage 4. To mimic maternal binge drinking patterns, P-UAECs were cultured in the absence or presence of alcohol (150 mg/dl) in a compensating system for 3 h on 3 consecutive days. Cell viability was validated by trypan blue exclusion microscopy, Calcein AM imaging, and immunoblotting. Following this treatment paradigm, control and binge alcohol treated P-UAECs were abstained from alcohol for two days and then treated with increasing concentrations of estrogen (0.1, 1, 10 nM) in the presence or absence of alcohol. Angiogenesis index was evaluated using BrdU Proliferation Assay. Results: Trypan blue stained cell count demonstrated that the number of viable cells in the control and binge alcohol groups were not different (control, 891,250 +/- 11,433; alcohol, 834,000 +/- 49,784; P = 0.73). We also observed that uncleaved caspase 3 was unaltered by binge alcohol and cleaved caspase 3 was not detectable demonstrating cell viability. A significant main effect of the alcohol treatment paradigm was noted (two way ANOVA, P = 0.003). Irrespective of the dose, estrogen-induced P-UAEC proliferation was significantly decreased in response to chronicbingealcohol(P = 0.025). Incontrast, estrogen-induced proliferation trended higher in response to acute alcohol treatment (P = 0.057). Further, estrogen-induced proliferation in chronic binge treated P-UAECs was significantly lower compared to acute alcohol treatment (P <0.001). Interestingly, these findings were closely associated with the effects of binge alcohol on the activity state and expression of the angiogenesis-associated enzyme eNOS and its related signaling cascades. Alcohol decreased P635eNOS, total eNOS, PERK1, total ERK1, and total ERK2 to 15%, 43%, 24%, 16%, and 21%, respectively whereas no alterations were observed with the AKT pathway. Conclusions: Thus: 1) proliferative effects of alcohol depend on the alcohol treatment paradigm; 2) chronic binge alcohol impairs estrogen-induced proliferation; 3) binge alcohol decreases the expression and activity of eNOS, a protein associated with P-UAEC proliferation; 3) effects of chronic binge alcohol on P-UAECs are specifically associated with ERK cascade not AKT pathway; and 5) these findings support the idea that the uterine compartment may play a key role in the pathogenesis of FASD.

N2  - The number of multiple congenital anomaly syndromes is increasing. Dysmorphology is important in the recognition and description of syndromes. Information obtained from studies of developmental and cellular processes in lower organisms has offered significant contributions to the understanding of the pathogenesis of syndromes. Most of the syndromes have genetic defects including chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations. Mutations in genes for transcription factors, growth factors, receptors, cell adhesion molecules, signal transduction, structural proteins, and transporters have been identified in genetic syndromes. In addition, alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which includes a range of developmental deficits. Fetal anticonvulsant syndromes are another example of environmental factors. Clinical use of genetic diagnosis is rapidly developing. Molecular diagnosis is available in many of the well known syndromes. Genome-wide screening of patients with multiple congenital anomaly and/or mental retardation using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization has recently led to the identification of new microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Proper diagnosis of syndromes makes it possible to provide genetic counseling for the parents, medical care and an accurate prediction relative to such a child's future development. Longitudinal observation of patients is necessary for better clinical management. Clinical investigations can also help to identify the genes involved in normal and abnormal morphogenesis, which often act as patterning genes and transcription factors that regulate other genes during embryonic development. Cooperation between basic studies and clinical genetics will produce promising results.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal stress was shown to induce a chronic anxiety state in adult humans. In addition to stress, fetus can be affected by alcohol. In USA 12.2% pregnant women are reported to use alcohol [1]. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by physical, psychical, and behavioral disturbances and learning deficit. The aim of the work was to study the influence of prenatal stress in combination with alcohol on locomotor activity, anxiety, and social behavior (sniffing and licking) of mice. Methods: Pregnant CBA/LacJ mice were given 11% ethanol solution ad libitum throughout gestation (without access to water) and stressed (restriction two hours daily in an unpredictable manner) during the last week of pregnancy. Three-month-old male offspring (A+S) were tested in the open field, dark-light box, elevated plus maze, marble burying, and social interaction tests. The control group consisted of the male mice of the same age from non-stressed dams, which had drunk the water during gestation. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA Results: In the marble burying test, A+S animals buried significantly more marbles (7.7+/-1.1) than intact ones (4.1+/-0.5) [F(1,27) = 8.77, P<0.01]. In the social interaction test, A+S animals spent more time (300.8+/-20.7 s) sniffing and licking three-week-old male mouse than intact ones (190.5+/-11.4 s) [F(1,28) = 21.75, P<0.001]. The total path length in the open field, test and the time spent in the center of the open field, for A+S mice did not differ from that of intact ones [F(1,17) = 0.001, P>0.05] and [F(1,17) = 0.32, P>0.05]. In the dark-light box test, no significant differences between A+S and intact animals in the time spent in the light compartment were found [F(1,16) = 0.94, P>0.05]. In the elevated plus maze test, there were also no differences in the time spent in open arms between A+S and control mice [F(1,16) = 0.06, P>0.05]. Therefore, in three tests for anxiety (dark-light box, elevated plus maze, time in the center of the open field) no significant effect of prenatal stress and alcohol exposure was found. The marble burying test is considered as an experimental model of obsessivecompulsive disorder [2,3]. An increased number of buried marbles and the enhanced social activity time in A+S mice were shown. Significantly increased sniffing and licking in A+S animals represent the manifestation of obsessions and compulsions rather than social interaction. The lack of any differences between A+S and control animals in the path length in the open field test showed that an increased marble burying and social activity was not associated with locomotor activity deviation. Conclusions: Stress and alcohol during prenatal development do not influence on anxiety state and locomotor activity in mice. Prenatal exposure to stress and alcohol can produce obsessivecompulsive- like behavior.

N2  - Objective: The fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the leading non genetic cause of mental disability and social and emotional problems in affected children, adolescents and young adults. However, efforts on research and prevention up to date have been poor. Materials and methods: In the Muenster University FAS clinic 135 young FAS patients were assessed for IQ, sustained attention, memory, information processing and psychosocial development. Additionally, social and emotional outcome was studied in 60 adult patients with FAS. Results: Children and adolescents with FAS show severe deficits in cognitive functioning. They suffer from a burdensome social and emotional maladaptation. Most adult FAS patients live in dependent circumstances. The occupational development is characterized by disruption and failure, and severe social problems are common in patients. Three in four adult patients are victims of (sexual) abuse. Conclusions: Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes severe cognitive, emotional and behavioural impairments in the child. Deficits are irreversible and persisting. Prevention of FAS, thus, is essential in gynecological counseling. Due of the variety of impairments caused by prenatal alcohol exposition and the persisting inability of independent living, patients with FAS need intense care, support and assistance throughout life.

N2  - Cerebral angiogenesis during brain development is under control of growth factors from the vascular endothelial growth factor family (VEGF). The fact that alcohol affects VEGF expression and angio-genesis in adults prompted us to investigate whether prenatal alcohol exposure may alter brain vascularization in both rodent and human foetuses. Mouse foetuses and pups were exposed to different concentrations of alcohol (0.5-3 g/kg) from embryonic day 13 to the first day of life (P1). Twelve foetuses with foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and age matched controls (22-36 WG) were also selected. Morphometric analyses on Glut1 immunostained brain slices were carried out. Protein and mRNA levels of the endothelium marker PECAM and VEGF receptors were quantified by q-RT-PCR and Western blot in mice. Calcimetry and videomicroscopy studies were performed on mouse cultured endothelial cells. In mice, perinatal alcohol exposure induced a dose-dependent reduction of the vascular network with a disorganization of microvessels which were randomly distributed. Protein and mRNA levels of PE-CAM and VEGF receptors were significantly reduced. Alcohol inhibited glutamate-induced calcium mobilization in endothelial cells and affected microvessel growth and survival. Though microvessel density was not significantly modified in human brains, cortical micro-vessel architecture was disorganized, 30-50% of vessels being non radially oriented 30 WG onwards. These results suggest that alcohol-induced developmental brain abnormalities could be partly due to vascular defects, and that members of the VEGF family would have an interest as FAS biomarkers.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol is a potential teratogen in humans, and it is consumed by many pregnant women in several countries, but so far no studies have estimated the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on male fecundity. We studied the association between maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, semen quality and levels of reproductive hormones in young, adult men. Material and Methods: From a Danish pregnancy cohort established in 1984-87, 347 sons were selected for a follow-up study conducted in 2005-2006. Semen and blood samples were analyzed for conventional semen characteristics and reproductive hormones, and results were related to self-reported information on maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results: The sperm concentration decreased with increasing prenatal alcohol exposure, and sons of mothers drinking > 4.5 drinks per week during pregnancy had approximately 32% (p = 0.04) lower adjusted sperm concentration in comparison with unexposed men. The semen volume and the total sperm count was also associated with prenatal alcohol exposure; men prenatally exposed to small amounts of alcohol having the highest values. No associations were found for sperm motility, sperm morphology or any of the reproductive hormones, including testosterone. Conclusions: These results indicate that prenatal exposure to alcohol may have a persisting adverse effect on semen quality, and if these associations are causal they could explain some of the reported differences between populations and secular changes in semen quality.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol use in pregnancy has been associated with numerous adverse effects including miscarriage, stillbirth, malformations, low birthweight and infant mortality. Developmental problems and fetal alcohol syndrome may occur. Despite national recommendations to abstain from alcohol use during pregnancy, rates remain high in Australia. Co-morbid psychiatric and alcohol use disorders are common and have been shown to have detrimental effects on treatment outcomes, with increased medical comorbidity, suicide, violence, child abuse. Aims: To determine the use of alcohol during pregnancy in women referred to a perinatal mental health team. Methods: A retrospective study of pregnant women referred to a perinatal mental health team was undertaken. A review of medical records identified the reported use of alcohol during pregnancy, demographic details including age, employment status, marital status, parity and psychiatric diagnosis. Outcomes of pregnancy recorded include gestational age at birth of baby, birth weight and malformations. Results: Of the 27 cases referred to the perinatal mental health clinic, 2 reported alcohol use during pregnancy. The average age was 28.96 years. 85.2% (23/27) were married or in a relationship; 14.8% (4/7) were single. 44.4% (12/27) were employed, 40.7% (11/27) were unemployed and there was a lack of data recorded on the employment status of 14.8% (4/27) cases. The mean number of previous pregnancies was 2.19. Psychiatric diagnoses were depression in 37% (10/27), anxiety in 22.2% (6/27), anorexia nervosa in 3.7% (1/27) case. 37% (10/27) recorded no psychiatric disorder. The average gestational age was 38 weeks. Mean weight of newborn babies was 3.41 kg. There were no major malformations identified in these cases; one newborn had an abnormal toe position. Discussion: Co-morbid alcohol use and psychiatric disorders can result in significant negative outcomes for the mother and offspring. The findings of this study indicate that alcohol use during pregnancy is low. These findings may be due to limitations of the study. Data is self-reported and may be underreported due to social desirability. In addition, the small numbers used in this study is a limitation. Alcohol use during pregnancy continues to be highly prevalent in Australia and a public health concern. It is important to identify these women early and implement appropriate management to minimize the harm of both alcohol and psychiatric illness to the mother and offspring.

N2  - Our study aimed at determining if the stress axis abnormality in fetal alcohol exposed offspring is caused by epigenetic marks on POMC gene, since a product of this gene s-endorphin has been shown to control the stress axis function. We provide evidence that alcohol feeding during GD 7 and 21 to mother produces alcohol-fed offspring with abnormal basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated corticosterone levels and reduced s-endorphin production and POMC gene expression persisting in adulthood. This change in POMC gene expression was associated with hypermethylation of POMC DNA that lasted in adulthood, even though the exposure to ethanol ended at GD 21. Additionally, we showed that fetal alcohol incited epigenetic mark on POMC gene possibly by increasing the level of H3K9 methylation and protein levels of Dnmt1 and MeCP2 in s-endorphin neurons. Importantly, gestational choline supplements, known to prevent ethanol-induced methyl deficiency, caused significant reversal of the fetal alcohol-induced changes in histone and DNA methyl transferases and prevented the hypermethylation of the POMC gene and the deficiency in POMC gene expression. We also found that the increased POMC DNA methylation, reduced gene expression and abnormal stress response persisted for one or two generations in female offspring and for a minimum period of three generations in male offspring of the mothers who drank alcohol during pregnancy. Together these results suggest that the folate deficiencies and altered methyl metabolism caused by the maternal alcohol consumption resulted in de novo hypermethylation and induced epigenetic marks on the POMC gene of the offspring leading to the suppression of POMC gene expression and its control of the stress axis function. These effects were transferred through male germline to subsequent generations.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure is known to induce deficiencies in fetal brain development. We found that ADNF-9, a peptide derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor and composed of nine amino acids (SALLRSIPA) is neuroprotective. We used a mouse model of fetal alcohol exposure to identify the intracellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v) ethanol derived calories; (2) pair-fed control; (3) ALC combined with administration (i.p.) of ADNF-9 (20 and 30 mug/20 g body weight); and (4) pair-fed combined with administration (i.p.) of ADNF-9 (20 and 30 mug/20 g body weight). On E13 fetal brains were collected, weighed, and assayed for Bcl2 protein levels using Western blot. Our results show that ADNF-9 significantly prevents alcohol-induced reductions in fetal brain weight at both doses. Western blot analysis of mitochondrial protein fractions revealed that prenatal alcohol exposure causes a significant down-regulation in Bcl2 protein levels. Importantly, ADNF-9 administration reduced this alcohol-induced decrease in Bcl2 at only the highest dose (30 mug/20 g i.p.). These data indicate that the Bcl2 pathway is an intracellular target of ADNF-9 and this neuroprotective mechanism of action provides a direction for potential therapeutics against alcohol-induced neural damage during prenatal development.

N2  - The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) describes the continuum of adverse effects that result from prenatal alcohol exposure. Most frequently, prenatal alcohol exposure induces subtle neurochemical and structural changes throughout the brain rather than gross malformations. The consequences of alcohol exposure then manifest in a wide variety of mild to moderate brain dysfunctions in processes such as memory, executive function, attention, and sensory-motor skills. In these studies, children with FASD (male and female, 5-17 years of age) and age- and sex-matched controls performed a series of structured eye movement tasks and/or a visually-guided reaching task in a robotic virtual reality system. The measurement of eye movement control is a powerful tool for assessing sensory, motor and cognitive function, whereas reaching tasks can be used to examine both feedforward and feedback sensory-motor integration. In structured eye movement tasks, children with FASD made many more errors in tasks requiring cognitive flexibility, and these increased error rates correlate strongly to deficits in spatial working memory. In a delayed, memory-guided saccade task, children with FASD completed fewer correct trials. Incorrect trials included: sequence errors where the saccades were directed to target locations in the incorrect order; timing errors where the subject initiated a saccadic response before the go signal; and false starts where the subject broke fixation but returned to the central fixation point to restart the task at the go signal. In the visually-guided reaching task, children with FASD differed from controls in many task outcome measures, specifically those measures related to the initial motor response and corrective responses. In particular, large effect sizes were observed for outcome measures related to the first (initial) movement (e.g., distance and direction error), the total movement path length relative to the optimal path length, and the ratio of the first sub-movement distance to total movement distance. These data suggest that children with FASD have difficulty integrating sensory information into planned motor movements. In summary, eye movement and bilateral reaching tasks can be coupled with novel technologies to create an integrated platform of non-invasive, neurobehavioural tasks that can be used to identify and objectively quantify functional deficits in children with FASD.

N2  - Preface: Alcohol drinking during pregnancy is dangerous for health of both the mother and the baby. In Russia drinking during pregnancy is not strictly prohibited, and even it is often considered quite harmless by close environment of the woman and by herself. The goal of our research is the consideration of the drinking by pregnant women learning the example of situation in Nizhny Novgorod region, Russia. Methods: The grant questionnaire 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention in Russia' developed by research FAS group [1] was used as a basic method. The self-reports of women were analyzed. We have questioned 150 pregnant women of 18-44 years old and analyzed the frequency of alcohol drinking of different types during pregnancy and 3 mouths before it. Results: In the issue the following data was obtained: the most of the woman reduce drinking during pregnancy, but a lot of pregnant woman are at risk zone. Conclusion: Drinking in any rate is a problem for public health in Russia. There is no "safe rate drinking" and the period for drinking during pregnancy. All drinks containing alcohol can harm the baby. Total abstinence of pregnant women is the objective of Russian public health development.

N2  - Introduction: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is dangerous for any woman and her unborn child. In Russia, alcohol consumption during pregnancy is not strictly prohibited, and it is often considered to be harmless by pregnant women and by the general public. A study in the Nizhny Novgorod region of Russia in 2004/2005 measured alcoholic drinking rates for women during pregnancy and during the three months prior to pregnancy. Method: The questionnaire used in the grant, 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention in Russia', developed by the research FAS group [1] was used as a basic method. In the FAS group's study, 648 women were included. Of these women, 155 pregnant women (ages of 18 to 44) were interviewed. Drinking habits were self-reported by involved participants. Frequency analysis was used as the method of analysis. Significance of differences was measured by Student T-test. Results: During the three months before pregnancy, drinking of 7 or more alcohol doses per week and 4 or more doses at a time was found to be common for 50% of women. Of these women, 34% of women consumed these levels of alcohol less often than once per month, 10% of women consumed once per month, 3% consumed two-three times monthly, and 4% consumed once per week. Women drinking 7 or more alcoholic doses per week and binge drinking were found to believe that lower quantities of spirits were harmful during pregnancy and that fewer amounts of alcoholic doses could be considered hard drinking during this time than drinking women in the not-at-risk group (differences are reliable at a rate of 0.01). During pregnancy, drinking rates were found to be lower-no women drinking 7 or more alcoholic doses per week or binge drinking; however, 1 to 3 doses weekly were still imbibed by 23.5 % of pregnant women. Conclusion: Drinking in any rate is a problem for public health in Russia. It is known that there are no safe drinking rates during pregnancy and it doesn't depend on spirit type or frequency of consumption-which is the foundation for why women are at risk of damaging their own health and health of the unborn child. All alcoholic drinks can harm the baby, yet there is still a prevalence of drinking, including drinking in high quantities, among pregnant women in Russia.

N2  - Objectives: Folic acid (FOL) is concentrated in the fetal circulation by the placenta so that cord levels are higher than maternal levels. FOL is also required for detoxification of formic acid(FA), the toxic metabolite of methanol that has recently been observed in cord blood of infants born to alcohol-using mothers (Kapur BM et al. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 2009;33:134A). The objectives of this study was to determine if FOL transport to the fetus is decreased after heavy alcohol exposure and therefore the ability to detoxify FA is compromised. This may contribute to deficits observed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Folate was measured in maternal and cord blood from alcohol-abusing mothers and controls. Results: The fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was = 1.0 in half of the alcohol-exposed pairs (n = 12), whereas all of the controls were > 1.0 (n = 8). Mean folate in cord samples was lower in alcohol-exposed than in the controls (25.83 +/- 13.58 vs 44.04 +/- 10.86, p < 0.01). There was a significant correlation between the control maternal and cord folate levels (p < 0.05) whereas the alcohol group correlation was not significant. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that FOL transport to the fetus is compromised in pregnancies affected by alcohol-abuse. This supports our hypothesis that FA may indeed be a significant contributor in the etiology of FASD, and, that FOL as part of treatment to mitigate its effects need to be investigated.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can adversely affect the developing brain, producing cognitive, behavioral, and motor impairments. These fetal alcohol effects may be influenced by nutritional factors. We have previously shown that administration of choline, a nutrient criticial for brain development, can mitigate the effects of developmental alcohol exposure on behavior. However, the mechanisms of choline's actions are not known. Choline acts as a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, acts as a precursor to cell membrane constituents, and also acts as a methyl donor which affects the homocysteine-methionine cycle. Betaine is a nutrient that can be synthesized from choline and mediate choline's actions on the homocysteine-methionine cycle. If choline affects brain and behavioral development by increasing betaine, then similar protective effects should be produced by administration of betaine. This study examined the effects of administering betaine during and after developmental ethanol exposure. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to alcohol during the 3rd trimester equivalent, which occurs postnatally in rats. On postnatal day (PD) 4, subjects were randomly assigned to one of 5 treatment groups: four ethanol-exposed and one sham control. From PD 4-9, ethanol-exposed subjects recieved 5.25 g/kg/day ethanol via intubation. Control subjects were sham intubated. From PD 4-30, ethanol-exposed groups were injected i.p. with 0, 100, 300, or 500 mg/kg/day betaine; the sham control group was injected with vehicle. From PD 37-39, motor coordination was measured on a parallel bar task, which measures both balance and fine motor coordination. Ethanol exposure significantly impaired motor performance among males, but not females, an effect that was attenuated by betaine administration in a dose-dependent manner. Although 100 mg/kg/day betaine did not improve performance, administration of 300 or 500 mg/kg/day did mitigate ethanol's effects. In fact, performance of subjects treated with these doses did not differ significantly from that of controls. These results indicate that betaine effectively mitigates balance and fine motor coordination deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure and that choline may be effective, in part, by influencing the homocysteine-methionine cycle.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure causes a collection of permanent physiological, and neurobehavioral deficits termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The timing and amount of exposure cannot fully explain the substantial variability among affected individuals, pointing to unelucidated genetic influences on individual vulnerability to alcohol effects. We investigated the role of genetic influences by administering ethanol (E), pair-fed (PF), or control (C) diets to pregnant dams of the outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) and inbred Brown Norway (BN) rat strains after they were mated with their own or with the other strain. The dams' plasma levels of free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), free T3 (fT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured to elucidate potential differences in their maternal thyroid hormonal environment, which is known to affect the neurobehavioral outcome of FASD. SD and BN dams exhibited different baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) function and SD dams were more severely affected by alcohol consumption. We then compared the bodyweight and placental weight of E, PF, and C offspring of each fetal strain on gestational day 21 (G21). The degree of fetal bodyweight decrease after alcohol exposure was modulated by the genetic contribution of both parents, while alcohol increased placental weight in all of the strains. Additional C, PF, and E offspring of reciprocal SD/BN crosses were allowed to develop into adulthood. E-exposed offspring exhibited two types of behavioral effects: dependent and independent of the parental strains. The two reciprocal crosses were differentially susceptible to an E-induced deficit in social behavior just as the E-consuming SD mother was more susceptible to thyroid hormone alterations. In contrast, E-induced memory deficits were consistent across the reciprocal crosses, suggesting a possible mechanistic link to strain-independent effects of alcohol such as placental enlargement. These findings show the utility of a rat model to dissect the neurobehavioral deficits of FASD into those that are strongly influenced by genetic susceptibility/resiliency, and others that probably arise from robust effects of the environmental insult itself.

N2  - Background: Recent surveys of physicians in Russia demonstrated limited knowledge about Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and lack of experience related to FASD prevention and interventions. Information on FAS, risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies, and brief interventions (BI) was not included in the medical school curriculum or in required Continuing Medical Education (CME) courses. The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate an FASD training curriculum for medical professionals in Russia. Methods: FASD Competency-Based Curriculum Development Guide and Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis (CDC, 2004) were adapted and implemented for training of Russian physicians. A pre-post test design in a randomized educational trial was used to determine the effectiveness of training in changing physicians' knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward drinking during pregnancy. OBGs (N = 65) and pediatricians (N = 73) from different regions of Russia were recruited to participate in the study through the CME program at St. Petersburg Pediatric Academy. The physicians were trained in groups by specialty and were randomly assigned to either experimental (a 3-hour FASD module as a part of regular CME program) or control condition (regular CME program without FASD module). A total of 14 groups of physicians were included in the study. Participants' pre-post changes in FASD knowledge, attitudes, and skills were assessed using questionnaires. In addition, OBGs' BI skills were assessed using coded videotapes of role plays with a simulated patient. Results: Pediatricians and OBGs who received FASD training demonstrated significantly improved knowledge about the effects of alcohol on fetal development and less acceptance of alcohol use during pregnancy than physicians who did not receive training. Pediatricians who received training had higher levels of competency in FASD diagnosis. Compared to OBGs assigned to regular CME, OBGs who received training had significantly improved BI skills and higher levels of competency in conducting screening and BI. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a three-hour FASD education module included in CME for pediatricians and OBGs leads to significant changes in physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and skills. Implications for public health and barriers for implementation of screening and BI for FASD prevention in Russia are discussed.

N2  - Acute and chronic ethanol consumption alters the intracellular traffic of proteins and lipids, suggesting that one or more of the elements participating in this process may be altered. One of the most relevant cell components involved in protein traffic is the Golgi complex. From the work of Palade's group and others, it is known that this cell component in the liver shows morphological and biochemical alterations after alcohol exposure. Our group demonstrates that prenatal alcohol exposure induces a fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus in newborn hepatocytes, which is accompanied by alterations in the activity of several enzymes, including galactosyltransferase. This treatment also induces a heterogeneous retention of secreted proteins by delaying, for example, the post-Golgi transport of albumin, but not of transferrin. Currently, we are working on the effect of chronic alcohol exposure on protein traffic in nervous cells. We have seen in astrocytes in primary culture how alcohol affects the exocytosis of secretory proteins such as the VSV-G protein. Moreover, alcohol affects the morphology of the Golgi in a dose-dependent manner, which displays swollen cisternae with no apparent alteration of other organelles. Alcohol also lowers the numbers of secretory vesicles and induces changes in the levels of several proteins involved in anterograde and retrograde transport. These effects relate with an alcohol-induced alteration of the organization and function of microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton. In fact, alcohol alters the ability of tubulin to polymerize and redistributes cortical actin. Moreover, the study of some microtubule motor proteins has revealed that kinesin and dynein levels significantly lowered in ethanol-treated astrocytes. Finally, we are also studying the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on protein traffic in neurons in primary culture and in PC12 cells. In both cell types, we found that alcohol induces Golgi complex fragmentation. In addition, changes in the expression of some proteins involved in the architecture of this organelle, such a p115 and GRASP65, were observed in PC12 cells. Similar changes in the Golgi complex morphology in neuronal cells have been associated with deficient axonal transport, as previously described in many neurodegenerative diseases. The results that we have obtained in nervous cells support the idea that ethanol affects most of the cell components involved in intracellular transport.

N2  - Vasculogenesis, a process which consists in the formation of new blood vessels from endothelial precursors, plays a crucial role during brain development. Indeed, vasculogenesis is concomitant with neurogenesis and supply nervous cells in oxygen and nutriments. Vasculogenesis is under control of growth factors of the vascular endothelial growth factor family (VEGF). The fact that alcohol affects VEGF expression and angiogenesis in adults prompts us to investigate whether prenatal alcohol exposure may alter brain vascularization in both rodent and human neonates. In vivo, mice foetuses and pups were exposed to different concentrations of alcohol (0.5 to 3 g/kg) from embryonic day 13 to the first day of life (P1). Visualization of the cortical vascular network at P2 revealed that perinatal alcohol exposure induced a dose-dependent reduction of the vascular network. This effect was associated with a clear disorganization of microvessels. In particular, while in control animals vessels preferentially presented a radial orientation, in alcohol-exposed animals they were randomly distributed. This vascular effect of alcohol was associated with a reduction of mRNA as well as protein levels of the endothelium marker PECAM and VEGF receptors quantified by q-RT-PCR and Western blot. Ex vivo, calcimetry and videomicroscopy experiments were performed on cortical slices at P2. Alcohol inhibited glutamate-induced calcium mobilization in endothelial cells and affected microvessel growth and survival. In vitro, visualization of microvessels by using Glut1 immunohistochemistry in cortical human slices from control and 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrom' patients clearly indicated a stage-dependent alteration of the vascular network. In conclusion, the present data strongly support that perinatal alcohol exposure affects vascular development as well the VEGF system. They suggest that alcohol-induced developmental abnormalities of the brain could be the consequence of vascular defects.

N2  - Many children affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy can not be identified using current diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We are investigating whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene and protein expression may provide reliable diagnostic indicators of maternal drinking during pregnancy as well as prognostic indicators of brain damage predictive of adverse behavioral outcomes in offspring. Pregnant Long-Evans rats consumed either saccharin water or 5% ethanol in saccharin water four hours per day throughout gestation, producing a mean maternal peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. At term, placentas were processed for gene and protein expression. Microarray analysis of > 28,000 genes revealed that the expression of 304 known genes was altered two-fold or greater in placenta from ethanol-consuming dams compared to controls. The genes altered encode proteins associated with CNS development, organ morphogenesis, immunologic responses, endocrine function, ion homeostasis and skeletal, cardiovascular and cartilage development. 2D-PAGE analyses and mass spectroscopy were used to separate and identify placental proteins affected by moderate drinking during pregnancy. To date, at least twenty of 1,181 protein spots are altered in placentas from ethanol-consuming dams. Fourteen of the twenty protein spots have been identified. Some of the identified proteins play critical roles in placental and neural development, toxicity or apoptosis. For example, the PDPC10 protein is involved in vascular morphogenesis and remodeling, an effect that may contribute to ethanol-induced changes in vascular remodeling during neurodevelopment. These results suggest that the expression of a sufficiently large number of placental mRNAs and proteins are altered after moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD. Further, these results provide insights on novel mechanisms of how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function and brain development.

N2  - After maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, many neonates affected by less-apparent forms of fetal alcoholic syndrome disorders (FASD) could not receive proper diagnosis and treatments. There is thus a need for laboratory markers for early detection of alcohol exposed neonates. The aim of our study was to assess the efficiency of usual alcohol biomarkers measured in cord blood to identify alcohol exposed neonates immediately after birth. A one-year study was conducted in the labour wards of Central France maternities at the time of term delivery. The patients answered to an anonymous self-completion survey concerning alcohol use (AUDIT) during their pregnancy. We collected 870 maternal-fetal pair samples for classical alcohol biomarkers analysis on maternal and cord blood. Two cases (0.2%) of typical FASD were detected. We report a non-significant correlation between the maternal and cord biomarkers. None of the blood cord biomarkers differed significantly between newborns of alcohol-exposed and - unexposed mothers. We also established that measurement of carbohydrate deficient transferring was impaired using immuno-turbidimetric and capillary electrophoris assays, due probably to un-matured forms of transferring. These biological and clinical data demonstrate that, in most cases, established alcohol biomarkers sampled from cord blood are not effective for detecting alcohol-exposed neonates, reinforcing the necessity to identify more sensitive alcohol biomarkers. This could be assessed by the development of other biomarkers in news borns, as for example fatty acid ethyl esters in hair or meconium to diagnosis FASD at delivery. To be earlier in the diagnosis of fetal consequences of maternal alcoholic consumption, we will also check the hypothesis of the determination of these biomarkers in amniotic fluid.

N2  - Background: Russia has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world and increasingly hazardous drinking in young women. Fetal alcohol exposure, including early in pregnancy when a woman may not know she is pregnant, has adverse outcomes. Data on women's alcohol consumption, contraception use, and risk for alcohol exposed pregnancies (AEP) in Russia are limited. This study was designed to collect data for developing prevention of AEP in Russia. Method: Women were recruited at public women's clinics in St. Petersburg (SPB) and the Nizhniy Novgorod Region (NNR). Six hundred forty-eight childbearing age women completed a face-to-face structured interview that assessed alcohol consumption and contraception use. Results: Among nonpregnant women (N = 347), 89% reported consuming alcohol and 65% reported binge drinking in the last three months, including 47% in NNR and 28% in SPB having binges at least once a month; 70% in NNR and 44% in SPB were at-risk for pregnancy1, including 12% in NNR and 9% in SPB who were trying to conceive. These women consumed alcohol at similar rates and amounts as women who were not at-risk for pregnancy; among trying to conceive women, 61% in SPB and 72% in NNR reported binge drinking. There was a significant decline in drinking after pregnancy identification: among pregnant women (N = 301), 20% reported drinking, including 6% in SBP (none in NNR) who reported current binge drinking. Differences in drinking and risk for AEP were identified between women in SPB and NNR. Conclusions: Although Russian women decrease alcohol consumption after pregnancy identification, high levels of consumption were reported in the preconception period. The high proportion of Russian women at risk for AEP constitutes a substantial risk for fetal alcohol exposure early in pregnancy and indicates the importance of primary prevention of AEP. A preconceptional, dual-focused (alcohol use/pregnancy planning/ contraception) intervention targeting women at risk for AEP has significant potential for preventing FASD in Russia.

N2  - This research project systematically reviewed international studies in antenatal care settings that assessed factors potentially predicting pregnant women's drinking during pregnancy. The aim was to contribute important knowledge for more effective alcohol preventive efforts in antenatal care. To obtain studies, we undertook a computerised literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. The following inclusion criteria were applied: recruitment of study participants took place in an antenatal care environment; data collection took place during the woman's pregnancy or immediately after delivery; data were collected in the last 10 years; predictors of any drinking during pregnancy were investigated; the study had a population-based orientation; the study was published in English in a scientific peer-reviewed journal in the last 10 years. We found 16 studies: 4 studies were carried out in the USA, 2 in Australia, 2 in Japan, 2 in Sweden, and 1 study each in New Zealand, Uganda, England, Ireland, Norway, and Spain. Although the population characteristics and protocols of these studies differed, some predictors were found to be consistent. Previous alcohol problems, i.e. alcohol abuse or dependence, were identified as a predictor in all the studies that examined the association between this factor and drinking during pregnancy. Higher pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption was also consistently identified as a predictor for drinking during pregnancy. Being abused or exposed to violence was positively associated with drinking during pregnancy in the three studies that examined this association. Psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression were found to predict drinking during pregnancy in three of the four studies that investigated this. In conclusion, for improved detection of women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies, antenatal care providers should assess women's pre-pregnancy drinking patterns (i.e. quantity and frequency of typical drinking), potential alcohol-related problems (i.e. abuse or dependence), and exposure to violence. These factors are consistently associated with drinking during pregnancy.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Alcohol (ethanol) consumption during pregnancy is linked to congenital heart defects associated with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Because reports have linked ethanol (EtOH) exposure with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, we defined whether a similar relationship exists between ethanol and modulation of cardiac cell fate determination by Wnt-beta-catenin signaling. Exposure of pregnant mice during gastrulation on ED 6.75 to a binge-drinking dose of EtOH induced atrioventricular and semi-lunar valve defects, as determined noninvasively on ED15.5 by echocardiography. EtOH exposure of avian embryos suppressed Wnt/beta-catenin modulated Hex (a marker of the primary heart field) and Islet-1 (a marker for the second heart field) gene expression within the cardiogenic crescent. Folic acid supplementation was tested for prevention of EtOH induced birth defects. Upon 30% EtOH exposure in the avian model, culture medium supplementation with FA, with and without myoinositol, resulted in normal expression of the cardiac markers. In the mouse after EtOH exposure, Folate supplementation or FA in combination with myo-Inositol resulted in normal valve development (100%) on ED 15.5 as assessed by echocardiography. In conclusion, Folate supplementation at a high dose of 10.5 mg/kg in diet, or in combination with myoinositol, prevented alcohol potentiation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling allowing normal cardiac gene activation and cardio-genesis.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is reported to be associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in some offspring. One of the concerns of pregnancy in diabetic women is a several-fold increase in birth defects in the offspring. Thus both maternal alcohol consumption and pregnancy in diabetes mellitus (DM) constitute independent risk factors for offspring maldevelopment. DM women are reported to not differ from non DM women in the drinking and smoking behavior. We aimed to determine the effects of potential interaction between acute doses of alcohol and maternal DM during gestation on fetal skeletal development. Mice were made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ) on gestation day (GD) 2. Single doses of 25% v/v of absolute alcohol in saline (0.03 ml/g body weight) was administered (IP) to groups of DM and non-DM animals on GD 7 or 8. One group of DM animals was treated with insulin (SC). Skeletons of GD 18 fetuses were stained with Alizarin redS and Alcian blue. Fetuses of both ethanol and DM group of mice were observed to have a low incidence of skull bones hypoplasia and vertebral defects. Ethanol injection of DM mice on GD 7 resulted in accentuation of DM-related skeletal defects. Treatment on GD 8 resulted in defects of axial and appendicular skeletons differentially. Combination treatment induced markedly poor ossification in about 60% of animals. Alcohol also was found to augment the frequency of supernumerary ribs and sternal anomalies and poor ossification of bones of paws. These data suggest that alcohol affects the developmental processes of mesoderm of embryos of diabetic mouse resulting in augmentation of skeletal malformations.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) account for a high frequency of growth deficiency, birth defects, and neurobehavioral impairment in infants. An ongoing study in Ukraine seeks to determine whether maternal nutrient status interacts with alcohol exposure to influence the risk for FASD. 3,736 pregnant women (mean gestational age 20.4 +/- 7.0 wks) were screened between April 2008 and December 2009 in two regions of Ukraine. 46.4% of the women were taking prenatal vitamins and/or folic acid at the time of screening. 10.9% were taking supplemental iodine. 94.8% of the women reported some alcohol consumption, a proportion that exceeds the U.S. 44.7%) reported consuming alcohol in the month around conception, and 33.3%) reported consuming alcohol in the most recent month of pregnancy. 9.0% reported at least one binge episode of 4 or more drinks in the month around conception, and 7.5% reported at least one binge episode of 4 or more drinks in the most recent month of pregnancy. A sample of screened women who reported frequent or binge drinking and low/unexposed comparison women were recruited into a prospective cohort study of maternal risk factors for alcohol-related pregnancy outcomes. Analysis to date of maternal baseline plasma samples shows that alcohol-exposed women (N=63) had lower Zn and Cu concentrations vs. controls (N=53). Ferritin, Fe, Mg, Ca, ceruloplasmin activity, methyl-donor nutrients (choline, betaine, DMG, folate, Vit B12, and homocysteine), Vit A, E, and indices of oxidative stress and inflammation (TBARS, protein carbonyls, hsCRP) were similar between groups. Regression analyses showed that the absolute oz. of alcohol/drinking day (AADD) in the month around conception was associated with lower plasma Total Radical-trapping Antioxidant Potential (TRAP) and Vit A. AADD in the most recent month of pregnancy was associated with lower Vit B12 and higher ferritin (which may indicate higher body stores of Fe). The low Zn and Cu in ethanol-exposed women and the lower TRAP and higher ferritin related with alcohol consumption may increase oxidative stress and contribute to alcohol-induced teratogenesis. The association of alcohol consumption with lower Vit B12 and Vit A may also contribute to adverse fetal development.

N2  - Introduction: There is a need for more effective assessment and primary prevention programs aimed at accurately measuring and reducing alcohol consumption before conception in underserved, high-risk populations. Health Information Technology (HIT) may serve this purpose; however, the effectiveness of such tools is not known. Methods: We conducted a small-scale randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an adapted web- based alcohol assessment and intervention tool among low- income, non-pregnant women of reproductive age who were receiving WIC services in San Diego County and who reported currently drinking in a binge pattern. Results: A total of 150 binge-drinking participants completed a web- based assessment and were randomly assigned to either receive a personalized feedback intervention OR general health information about alcohol consumption and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Follow-Up assessments on reported alcohol consumption were conducted via telephone at 1- and 2-months post baseline. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 44 and were predominately Hispanic/Latina (44%). At baseline, all respondents reported consuming >3 standard drinks on >1 occasion in the previous month. Outcome was available for 131 participants. The main outcome measure was reduction in number of risky drinking occasions, and did not differ significantly between treatment conditions, (OR 1.200, 95% CI 0.567-2.539, p=0.634). However, over 70% of the participants reported a reduction in risky drinking occasions regardless of treatment condition (Control 43/63, 68%; Experimental 49/68, 72%). Furthermore, after controlling for confounding in a multivariate hierarchical logistic regression model, the estimate of treatment effect reached borderline significance (OR 2.922, 95% CI 0.991-8.613, p=0.052). Discussion: The results of the present study demonstrate that web-based assessment of alcohol consumption among low-income women of reproductive age, as represented by WIC clients, is feasible and acceptable. The findings also suggest that detailed and interactive assessments of alcohol consumption may be sufficient for the reduction of risky drinking within this population and personalized feedback may be more effective for a subset of individuals.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol (ethanol) during pregnancy can cause a spectrum of structural, cognitive and behavioural anomalies termed the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, there is evidence suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the teratogenic mechanism. To determine the extent to which ROS are involved in FASD, CD-I dams were dosed on gestational day (GD) 9 (plug = GD 1) and exposed to ethanol (4, 6 g/kg low and high dose, respectively) or its vehicle, with or without pretreatment with phenylbutylnitrone (PBN), a free radical spin trapping agent previously shown to reduce embryonic ROS formation and embryopathies caused by teratogens like phenytoin and thalidomide. Ethanol caused dose-dependent teratogenesis that was reduced by pretreatment with PBN. Exposure to 4 g/kg ethanol alone decreased crown-rump length (p < 0.05), while exposure to 6 g/kg ethanol alone decreased fetal weight and crown-rump length, and increased the incidences of resorptions, microcephaly and nasal defects (p < 0.05). Pretreatment of dams with PBN (40 mg/kg) followed by ethanol (4 or 6 g/kg) was protective, evidenced by increases in fetal weight and crown rump-length, as well as decreases in the incidences of microcephaly and nasal defects (p < 0.01) compared to dams exposed to ethanol alone. The reduction in ethanol teratogenesis by PBN pretreatment in mice suggests that ROS may contribute to the FASD.

N2  - In order to explore effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on functional lateralization, item tasks measuring preferences of hand, foot, eye, and ear were administered to a sample of 23 children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) compared with typically developing (TD) children. In addition, a dichotic listening task was administered to a subsample of 11 children with FAS and a TD group of comparable age, sex and handedness. The children with FAS were characterized by increased nonright-handedness compared with TD children. No differences were evident for preferential use of foot, eye, or ear. Moreover, children with FAS displayed more right ear extinctions during dichotic listening relative to TD children, indicating a lack of right ear advantage. The results add to findings of decreased manual asymmetry and less left-lateralized speech perception in children with developmental disorders, and are further discussed in relation to the high incidence of callosal abnormalities in alcohol-exposed children. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Objectives: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a significant public health issue with lifelong psychological, emotional and financial costs associated with caring for an affected individual. In 2005, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch developed evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We examined the extent to which prenatal records across Canadian provinces and territories currently integrate key recommendations from these guidelines. Methods: A content analysis of prenatal record forms retrieved from each Canadian province and territory (N=12) was conducted to identify all questions or intervention prompts related to prenatal screening, exposure assessment, counseling or referral for maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Findings were reviewed in relation to recommendations extrapolated from the Canadian guidelines and the FASD literature. Results: All the prenatal record forms contained questions to assess maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. However, the dimensions of alcohol consumption assessed and the format, wording and number of items related to each dimension varied markedly across provinces/territories. Only five prenatal record forms included a validated screening tool to identify risky alcohol drinking behaviour. Most of the forms lacked prompts to encourage providers to intervene or refer pregnant clients with high-risk drinking behaviour. Conclusion: Integration of the Canadian recommendations into Canadian prenatal record forms may be an effective public health strategy for helping identify pregnancies at high risk for alcohol exposure, reducing the incidence of a FASD through appropriate prenatal intervention and referral, and facilitating early diagnosis of a FASD. © Canadian Public Health Association, 2009.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and research advancements in the field of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) require accurate and valid identification of FASD clinical subgroups. OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive neuropsychological battery, coupled with magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified across the spectrum, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications within the spectrum. The neuropsychological outcomes of the comprehensive neuroimaging study are presented here. METHODS: The study groups included: 1) FAS/Partial FAS; 2) Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed (SE/AE); 3) Neurobehavioral Disorder/Alcohol Exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed by an interdisciplinary team using the FASD 4-Digit Code; and 4) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol. A standardized neuropsychological battery was administered to each child and their primary caregiver by a psychologist. RESULTS: Use of the 4-Digit Code produced three clinically and statistically distinct FASD clinical subgroups. The three subgroups (ND/AE, SE/AE and FAS/PFAS) reflected a linear continuum of increasing neuropsychological impairment and physical abnormality, representing the full continuum of FASD. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders were comparably prevalent across the three FASD groups, and significantly more prevalent than among the Controls. All three FASD subgroups had comparably high levels of prenatal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although ND/AE, SE/AE, and FAS/PFAS are distinct FASD subgroups, these groups are not distinguishable solely by their neuropsychological profiles. While all children within a group shared the same magnitude of neuropsychological impairment, the patterns of impairment showed considerable individual variability. MRI, MRS and fMRI further distinguished these FASD subgroups.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of dose and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure with early language acquisition. METHODS: We examined language delay in a randomly selected, population-based sample of Western Australian children born in 1995-1996 whose mothers had agreed to participate in a longitudinal study on health-related behaviors and who had completed the 2-year questionnaire (N = 1739). Information on alcohol consumption was collected at 3 months after birth for four periods; the three months pre-pregnancy and for each trimester separately. Prenatal alcohol exposure was grouped into none, low, moderate-heavy and binge (>5) based on the total quantity consumed per week, quantity consumed per occasion, and frequency of consumption. The communication scale from the Ages & Stages Questionnaire was used to evaluate language delay. Logistic regression analysis was used to generate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for confounding factors. RESULTS: There was no association between low levels of alcohol consumption and language delay at any time period, although there was a nonsignificant 30% increase in risk when moderate-to-heavy levels of alcohol were consumed in the third trimester. Children exposed to a binge pattern of maternal alcohol consumption in the second trimester had nonsignificant, three-fold increased odds of language delay, with a similar estimate following third trimester alcohol exposure after controlling for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not detect an association between low levels of prenatal alcohol exposure and language delay when compared with women who abstained from alcohol during pregnancy. A nonsignificant threefold increase in the likelihood of language delay was seen in children whose mothers binged during late pregnancy. However, the small numbers of women with a binge-drinking pattern in late pregnancy limited the power of this study; studies analyzing larger numbers of children exposed to binge drinking in late pregnancy are needed.

N2  - Alcohol use by pregnant women is a significant public health issue despite well-described risks to the fetus including physical and intellectual growth retardation and malformations. Although clinical studies are limited, they suggest that in utero alcohol exposure also results in significant immune deficiencies in naive neonates. However, little is known about fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) effects on adult infections. Therefore, to determine the long-term effects of FAE on disease susceptibility and the adult immune system, we infected FAE adult mice with influenza virus. In this study, we demonstrate that mice exposed to ethanol during gestation and nursing exhibit enhanced disease severity as well as increased and sustained pulmonary viral titers following influenza virus infection. Secondary exposure to alcohol as an adult further exacerbates these effects. Moreover, we demonstrate that FAE mice have impaired adaptive immune responses, including decreased numbers of virus-specific pulmonary CD8 T cells, a decreased size and frequency of pulmonary B cell foci, and reduced production of influenza-specific Ab following influenza infection. Together, our results suggest that FAE induces significant and long-term defects in immunity and susceptibility to influenza virus infection and that FAE individuals could be at increased risk for severe and fatal respiratory infections.

N2  - This paper highlights gender peculiarities in the neuroscience of alcohol effects and draws attention to emerging problems due to simultaneous exposure to alcohol and environmental factors. All the available gender studies on alcohol show greater severity of alcohol-related damage, including brain damage, in females compared with males. The differences are due to physiological peculiarities that make women more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol. Today the trend to start consuming alcohol at a younger age, together with the growing number of women drinking excessively, is increasing the alcohol-related risks to women's health and justifying the need for better, gender-based studies of alcohol use and abuse. A further aspect to consider in this context is the risk of the occurrence of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders and foetal alcohol syndrome in the offspring of women who drink during pregnancy. Several lines of evidence indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure can influence cell proliferation and differentiation in the central nervous system, causing severe neurotoxicity and permanent birth defects.

N2  - Although alcoholic abuse during pregnancy is a dangerous state for the fetus' health, medical doctors nowadays have several problems in making an early diagnosis. This is due, in many cases, to mothers' omission about their situation. As concerns alcoholic abuse, we cannot find just one cause, but we can discuss biological, social and psychological causes. Prenatal alcohol exposure can determine Fetal Alcoholic Syndrome. The approach to mothers consists of psychological support and correction of the metabolic and nutritional unbalance. © Copyright 2009, CIC Edizioni Internazionali.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested gestational weeks 8-14 as a time window of particular importance to the intrauterine development of the male genitalia, and prenatal exposure to alcohol is under suspicion as a risk factor for cryptorchidism. We examined if prenatal exposure to alcohol, and especially binge drinking, during the suggested programming window is associated with an increased risk of cryptorchidism. METHODS: The authors used data on 41 268 live born singleton boys of mothers who were enrolled into the Danish National Birth Cohort in 1996-2002. During early childhood, 1598 cases of cryptorchidism were identified and 398 of these were orchiopexy verified. Maternal alcohol consumption including number and timing of binge drinking episodes was assessed in two computer-assisted telephone interviews around gestational weeks 17 and 32. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of cryptorchidism were estimated by Cox regression. RESULTS: Average weekly alcohol consumption as well as frequency of binge drinking at any time during pregnancy was not associated with risk of cryptorchidism. Binge drinking in gestational weeks 7-15 was associated with a slightly increased risk of cryptorchidism with adjusted HRs between 1.03 and 1.66.CONCLUSIONPrenatal exposure to alcohol-measured as average intake as well as frequency and timing of binge drinking-was not associated with cryptorchidism. Our findings, however, do not rule out that binge drinking during the suggested male programming window may increase the risk of cryptorchidism.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Aims: The study researched alcohol consumption and drinking patterns before and during pregnancy. Method: This was a 1 month self report survey of postnatal women from 21 May-22 June 2006. A multiple choice questionnaire was handed out to them on the first or second postnatal day. Results: There were a total of 117 deliveries. The questionnaire was completed by 100 of the 104 women who received it. Before pregnancy, 80% of women reported drinking alcohol; 66% binge drinking. Twenty-eight percent continued consuming alcohol throughout pregnancy. The majority did reduce or stop their alcohol consumption, 7% however did not. Ten percent were drinking more than 2 units per typical day and more than 7 units per week during pregnancy. Four percent was drinking a lot more than this. Nine percent of the total cohort reported binge drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Just over a quarter of women drink alcohol throughout pregnancy. A significant minority of women drink relatively heavily (more than 4 units per occasion and multiple times per week) during pregnancy. Many women do reduce their alcohol use because of the pregnancy, but often only after they become aware of it. In New Zealand there is a real risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. ©NZMA.

N2  - Background: Chronic prenatal alcohol exposure causes a spectrum of deleterious effects in offspring, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and deficits in executive function are prevalent in FASD. The goal of this research was to test the hypothesis that children with FASD exhibit performance deficits in tasks that assess attention, planning and spatial working memory. Methods: Subjects (8-15 years male and female children) with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and age- and sex-matched controls, completed four tasks selected from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTABResults: Compared with age-matched control children (n = 92), subjects with FASD (n = 89) exhibited longer reaction and decision times (effect size range; Cohen's d = .51 to .73), suggesting deficits in attention. Children with FASD demonstrated deficits in planning and spatial working memory that became more pronounced when task difficulty increased. The largest effect size in this study population (Cohen's d = 1.1) occurred in the spatial working memory task. Only one outcome measure revealed differences across the diagnostic subgroups, although all groups were different from control. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that deficits in multiple executive function domains, including set shifting, planning and strategy use, attention and spatial working memory, can be assessed in children with FASD using an easy to administer, brief battery of computer-based neuropsychological tasks. The tasks appear to be equally sensitive for brain injury resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol, regardless of the presence of facial dysmorphology. © 2008 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been consistently linked to neurocognitive deficits and structural brain abnormalities in affected individuals. Structural brain abnormalities observed in regions supporting spatial working memory (SWM) may contribute to observed deficits in visuospatial functioning in youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in alcohol-exposed individuals during a SWM task. There were 22 young subjects (aged 10-18 years) with documented histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 10), and age- and sex-matched controls (CON, n = 12). Subjects performed a SWM task during fMRI that alternated between 2-back location matching (SWM) and simple attention (vigilance) conditions. Results: Groups did not differ on task accuracy or reaction time to the SWM condition, although CON subjects had faster reaction times during the vigilance condition (617 millisecond vs. 684 millisecond, p = 0.03). Both groups showed similar overall patterns of activation to the SWM condition in expected regions encompassing bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal lobes and parietal areas. However, ALC subjects showed greater BOLD response to the demands of the SWM relative to the vigilance condition in frontal, insular, superior, and middle temporal, occipital, and subcortical regions. CON youth evidenced less increased brain activation to the SWM relative to the vigilance task in these areas (p < 0.05, clusters > 1,664 mul). These differences remained significant after including Full Scale IQ as a covariate. Similar qualitative results were obtained after subjects taking stimulant medication were excluded from the analysis. Conclusions: In the context of equivalent performance to a SWM task, the current results suggest that widespread increases in BOLD response in youth with FASDs could either indicate decreased efficiency of relevant brain networks, or serve as a compensatory mechanism for deficiency at neural and/or cognitive levels. In context of existing fMRI evidence of heightened prefrontal activation in response to verbal working memory and inhibition demands, the present findings may indicate that frontal structures are taxed to a greater degree during cognitive demands in individuals with FASDs. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) reflects a constellation of congenital abnormalities caused by excess maternal consumption of alcohol. It is likely that interference with embryonic development plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Ethanol-induced apoptosis has been suggested as a causal factor in the genesis of FAS. Mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells are pluripotent cells that differentiate in vitro to cell aggregates termed embryoid bodies (EBs), wherein differentiation capacity and gene expression profile are similar to those of the early embryo. Methods: To investigate the effects of ethanol during differentiation, mES cells were cultured on a gelatin surface in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor which maintains adherent undifferentiated cells or in suspension to promote formation of EBs. All cells were treated (1-6 days) with 80 mM ethanol. The pluripotency and differentiation of mES cells were evaluated by western blotting of stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA-1), transcription factors Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Nanog, using alkaline phosphatase staining. Apoptosis (early to late stages) was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using TdT-mediated biotin-dUTP nick-end labelling assay and fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Results: Ethanol increased apoptosis during in vitro differentiation of mES cells to EBs, whereas undifferentiated cells were not affected. Ethanol exposure also interfered with pluripotency marker patterns causing an upregulation of SSEA-1 under self-renewal conditions. In EBs, ethanol delayed the downregulation of SSEA-1 and affected the regulation of transcription factors during differentiation. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that ethanol may contribute to the pathogenesis of FAS by triggering apoptotic pathways during differentiation of embryonic stem cells and deregulating early stages of embryogenesis. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

From conception to parturition, Wistar rat dams were exposed to the following treatments: (1) Rat dams consuming a thiamine-deficient diet; (2) 12% alcoholwater drinking mothers; (3) mothers drinking 12% alcohol/water+thiamine hydrochloride mixture. Appropriate pair-fed controls and ad libitum controls were assessed. Gestation outcome and fetal parameters, including spontaneous abortion, still-born fetuses, litter size and birth weight, were assessed from the dams of each experimental group. Results. Both alcohol and thiamine deficiency during pregnancy increased fetal death (48.26 %vs. 84.47%), reduced litter size (44.54% vs. 72.7%), respectively, and lowered birth weight. Thiamine administration reversed the effects of alcohol-induced fetal death, suggesting that a part of deleterious actions of alcohol on fetal death was mediated by thiamine deficiency. Prenatal thiamine deficiency increased singularly spontaneous abortion with abundant bleeding (40?%), rising the occurrence of stillbirth. Such a pathology was not observed in alcohol group. Conclusions. The results indexed thiamine deficiency as a potent risk factor for stillbirths. The vitamin supply during pregnancy prevents stillbirths related to chronic alcoholism and different facets of malnutrition. ©2009 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a range of disabilities caused by gestational exposure to alcohol. FASD is the leading cause of preventable mental retardation and developmental disability in the United States, with an incidence of 1-10 per 1000 live births. FASD in Israel has yet to be examined systematically. Objectives: To evaluate professionals' experience, awareness and knowledge of FASD in Israel and their awareness of maternal consumption of alcohol, and to collect epidemiological data on the syndrome in Israel. Methods: A short questionnaire was sent to all 43 program directors of genetic institutes (n=14) and child developmental centers in Israel (n=29). Four questions related to their experience and knowledge of FASD. The epidemiological survey included data from all 17 hospitals in Israel and from the two main health management organizations within the public health care system. Results: The response rate was 98% (n=42). A total of 38.1% of respondents reported having diagnosed at least one case of FASD and fewer than 10% of respondents stated that the knowledge regarding FASD among physicians in Israel was adequate. Developmental pediatricians were more likely to have diagnosed at least one case as compared to geneticists. During the period 1998-2007 the diagnosis of FASD appeared in the records of only 4 patients from the total number of 17 hospitals in Israel. During the same period only six patients were diagnosed at the HMO within the public health care system. Conclusions: Despite the accumulated knowledge on FASD in many countries and the increase in alcohol consumption in Israel, professionals' awareness of its potential damage is limited. Educational programs to increase physician awareness should accompany publicity campaigns warning the public of the dangers associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Adaptive behavior, the ability to respond successfully to everyday demands, may be especially sensitive to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Similar adaptive dysfunction is common in other developmental disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is frequently present in alcohol-exposed children and this overlap in clinical presentation makes identification of alcohol-exposed children difficult. Direct comparison of children with prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD may yield distinct patterns of cognitive and behavioral performance and add to growing knowledge of the neuropsychological and behavioral profile of prenatal alcohol exposure. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare adaptive behavior in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC), nonexposed children with ADHD (ADHD), and typically developing controls (CON). Methods: Sixty-five children (ALC = 22, ADHD = 23, CON = 20) were selected from a larger ongoing study of the behavioral teratogenicity of alcohol. Alcohol-exposed and control participants were selected to match the ADHD subjects on age, sex, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. Caregivers were administered the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, a semi-structured interview, and were asked to rate their child's behavior on 3 domains of adaptive function. Data were analyzed using regression techniques. Results: Relative to controls, children in both the ALC and ADHD groups showed adaptive behavior deficits on all 3 domains and children in the ALC group were significantly more impaired than the ADHD group on the daily living skills domain. Within the ALC group, socialization standard scores were lower at older ages. This negative relationship between age and standard scores in the ALC group was also observed on the communication domain, a finding not previously reported. Conclusions: This study suggests that both children with prenatal alcohol exposure and children with ADHD show impairments in adaptive function relative to controls, but that the pattern of impairment differs between these clinical groups. Adaptive ability in children with prenatal alcohol exposure is characterized by an arrest in development, as evidenced by a lack of improvement with age in socialization and communication scores. In contrast, children with ADHD exhibit a developmental delay in adaptive ability as their scores continued to improve with age, albeit not to the level of control children. Continued research focused on elucidating the patterns of deficits that exist in alcohol-exposed children ultimately will lead to improved differential diagnosis and effective interventions. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Both executive function deficits and slower processing speed are characteristic of children with fetal alcohol exposure, but the temporal dynamics of neural activity underlying cognitive processing deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder have rarely been studied. To this end, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to examine the nature of alcohol-related effects on response inhibition by identifying differences in neural activation during task performance. Methods: We recorded ERPs during a Go/No-go response inhibition task in 2 groups of children in Cape Town, South Africa (M age = 11.7 years; range = 10 to 13) - one diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (FAS/PFAS; n = 7); the other, a control group whose mothers abstained or drank only minimally during pregnancy (n = 6). Children were instructed to press a "Go" response button to all letter stimuli presented except for the letter "X," the "No-go" stimulus, which occurred relatively infrequently. Results: Task performance accuracy and reaction time did not differ between groups, but differences emerged for 3 ERP components - P2, N2, and P3. The FAS/PFAS group showed a slower latency to peak P2, suggesting less efficient processing of visual information at a relatively early stage (~200 ms after stimulus onset). Moreover, controls showed a larger P2 amplitude to Go versus No-go, indicating an early discrimination between conditions that was not seen in the FAS/PFAS group. Consistent with previous literature on tasks related to cognitive control, the control group showed a well-defined, larger N2 to No-go versus Go, which was not evident in the FAS/PFAS group. Both groups showed the expected larger P3 amplitude to No-go versus Go, but this condition difference persisted in a late slow wave for the FAS/PFAS group, suggesting increased cognitive effort. Conclusions: The timing and amplitude differences in the ERP measures suggest that slower, less efficient processing characterizes the FAS/PFAS group during initial stimulus identification. Moreover, the exposed children showed less sharply defined components throughout the stimulus and response evaluation processes involved in successful response inhibition. Although both groups were able to inhibit their responses equally well, the level of neural activation in the children with FAS/PFAS was greater, suggesting more cognitive effort. The specific deficits in response inhibition processing at discrete stages of neural activation may have implications for understanding the nature of alcohol-related deficits in other cognitive domains as well. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: While behavioral studies have established that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can result in diminished arithmetic processing capability, the underlying neural correlates of this deficit are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the effect of PAE on neuronal activation during a subtraction task. Methods: Participants were young adults from a low socio-economic status population who were identified prenatally; the sample consisted of healthy unexposed controls (n = 17) and PAE who were subdivided based on the presence (n = 19) or absence of physical dysmorphic signs (n = 18). Multiple regression analysis was used to determine extent of activation and percent signal change during arithmetic processing, using a letter-matching task as the baseline. Region of interest analysis of activation was performed in the native space and normalized for each individual to compensate for the considerable variability in head size observed in the alcohol-exposed population. Results: An exposure-dependent response was observed in task performance and neuronal activation. Dysmorphic PAE individuals showed significantly lower task-related performance and activation in regions known to be associated with arithmetic processing, including left superior and right inferior parietal regions and medial frontal gyrus, while the nondysmorphic PAE group was generally intermediate but not significantly different from the control group in task performance and activation. Conclusions: Results indicate that there is a range of effects of PAE on arithmetic processing and that the severity of this deficit may be dependent on degree of impairment demonstrated by the exposed individual. Evidence of physical dysmorphia may be indicative of functional damage to regions associated with arithmetic calculation, resulting in markedly impaired neuronal recruitment. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Several studies have now shown corpus callosum abnormalities using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in comparison with nonexposed controls. The data suggest that posterior regions of the callosum may be disproportionately affected. The current study builds on previous efforts, including our own work, and moves beyond midline corpus callosum to probe major inter-hemispheric white matter pathways with an improved DTI tractographic method. This study also expands on our prior work by evaluating a larger sample and by incorporating children with a broader range of clinical effects including full-criteria fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Methods: Participants included 33 children with FASD (8 FAS, 23 partial FAS, 2 static encephalopathy) and 19 nonexposed controls between the ages of 10 and 17 years. Participants underwent DTI scans and intelligence testing. Groups (FASD vs. controls) were compared on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in 6 white matter tracts projected through the corpus callosum. Exploratory analyses were also conducted examining the relationships between DTI measures in the corpus callosum and measures of intellectual functioning and facial dysmorphology. Results: In comparison with the control group, the FASD group had significantly lower FA in 3 posterior tracts of the corpus callosum: the posterior mid-body, the isthmus, and the splenium. A trend-level finding also suggested lower FA in the genu. Measures of white matter integrity and cognition were correlated and suggest some regional specificity, in that only posterior regions of the corpus callosum were associated with visual-perceptual skills. Correlations between measures of facial dysmorphology and posterior regions of the corpus callosum were nonsignificant. Conclusions: Consistent with previous DTI studies, these results suggest that microstructural posterior corpus callosum abnormalities are present in children with prenatal alcohol exposure and cognitive impairment. These abnormalities are clinically relevant because they are associated with cognitive deficits and appear to provide evidence of abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure independent of dysmorphic features. As such, they may yield important diagnostic and prognostic information not provided by the traditional facial characteristics. Copyright © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Binge drinking during pregnancy might lead to the development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in the offspring. Latinas are often considered a low-risk group for alcohol abuse, although recent reports indicate that the prevalence of alcohol consumption in this group is increasing due to changing cultural norms. The predictors of alcohol consumption during pregnancy among Latinas are largely unknown. We explored predictors of periconceptional drinking among Latinas (n = 155) recruited into an ongoing cohort study at the University of New Mexico. Women were interviewed by a bilingual trained interviewer about any episodes of binge drinking (>4 drinks/occasion) a month around their last menstrual period (LMP) and were administered a TWEAK questionnaire. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and reproductive health characteristics were also ascertained. Predictors of binge drinking were identified by Chi-square test and logistic regression in univariate and multivariable analyses, respectively. Backward selection procedure was used to identify covariates that were independently associated with binge drinking in the final model. The mean age of participants was 27.0 +/- 5.8 years and 69% were foreign born. In the entire sample, 17.4% of pregnant Latinas admitted at least one binge-drinking episode in the month around their LMP. Results of multivariate analysis indicate that Latinas born in the United States have a much greater risk of binge drinking in the periconceptional period (odds ratio [OR] = 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 8.9) compared with foreign-born Latinas. Similarly, Latinas who primarily speak English at home were at much greater risk (OR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 10.5) compared with primarily Spanish-speaking women. No other variables were identified as significant predictors in multivariable models. Our results indicate that more acculturated Latinas are at much greater risk of binge drinking before conception and in early pregnancy compared with less acculturated Latinas. Culturally sensitive interventions should be developed to address risky alcohol consumption among Latinas of reproductive age. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The role of alcohol in the causation of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) has been firmly established. In most cases events leading to its occurrence have been set into motion prior to conception. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the sole causative agent of FAS, can therefore be prevented even prior to conception by implementation of preconception counseling (PCC). The present review examines the important issues involved in the implementation of PCC for the prevention of FAS which can be of immense help to the affected population.

N2  - Behavioral problems are frequent among post-institutionalized Eastern European adoptees. However, risk factors related to outcomes have not been fully delineated. We evaluated 50 Eastern European adoptees, age 8-10 years, with their adoptive families for more than five years. Cognitive and behavioral outcomes and parenting stress were evaluated in relation to pre-adoptive risk factors, including arrival age, growth, and facial phenotype related to prenatal alcohol exposure. At follow-up, IQ and achievement scores were > average in most children (>74%). Behavioral and school problems were common (externalizing 44%, internalizing 18%, behavioral symptoms 50%, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 46%, learning disabilities 40%, mental health disorders 28%); 38% had multiple problems. Behavioral problems correlated inversely with IQ. Parent stress was high and correlated with child externalizing behaviors and inversely to child full scale IQ. Children with "severe behavioral disturbances" (24%) were more likely to have had smaller head circumferences at arrival. Child's age at adoption related inversely to parent stress, possibly due to the longer duration of time that children resided with their families. "High/intermediate risk" phenotypic facial scores for prenatal alcohol exposure (58%) correlated with head circumference z scores at arrival and follow-up. Otherwise, arrival age, growth, and facial phenotype did not correlate with these specific outcome measures. © 2009 The International Society for the Study of Behavioural Development.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at microscopic levels, provides unprecedented opportunities to aid in defining the full spectrum of ethanol's insult to the developing brain. This is the first in a series of reports that, collectively, will provide an MRM-based atlas of developmental stage-dependent structural brain abnormalities in a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) mouse model. The ethanol exposure time and developmental stage examined for this report is gestational day (GD) 8 in mice, when the embryos are at early neurulation stages; stages present in humans early in the fourth week postfertilization. Methods: For this study, pregnant C57Bl/6J mice were administered an ethanol dosage of 2.8 g/kg intraperitoneally at 8 days, 0 hour and again at 8 days, 4 hours postfertilization. On GD 17, fetuses that were selected for MRM analyses were immersion fixed in a Bouin's/Prohance solution. Control fetuses from vehicle-treated dams were stage-matched to those that were ethanol-exposed. The fetal mice were scanned ex vivo at 7.0 T and 512 x 512 x 1024 image arrays were acquired using 3-D spin warp encoding. The resulting 29 mum (isotropic) resolution images were processed using ITK-SNAP, a 3-D segmentation/ visualization tool. Linear and volume measurements were determined for selected brain, head, and body regions of each specimen. Comparisons were made between control and treated fetuses, with an emphasis on determining (dis)proportionate changes in specific brain regions. Results: As compared with controls, the crown-rump lengths of stage-matched ethanol-exposed GD 17 fetuses were significantly reduced, as were brain and whole body volumes. Volume reductions were notable in every brain region examined, with the exception of the pituitary and septal region, and were accompanied by increased ventricular volumes. Disproportionate regional brain volume reductions were most marked on the right side and were significant for the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum; the latter being the most severely affected. Additionally, the septal region and the pituitary were disproportionately large. Linear measures were consistent with those of volume. Other dysmorphologic features noted in the MR scans were choanal stenosis and optic nerve coloboma. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that exposure to ethanol occurring in mice at stages corresponding to the human fourth week postfertilization results in structural brain abnormalities that are readily identifiable at fetal stages of development. In addition to illustrating the utility of MR microscopy for analysis of an FASD mouse model, this work provides new information that confirms and extends human clinical observations. It also provides a framework for comparison of structural brain abnormalities resulting from ethanol exposure at other developmental stages and dosages. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this pilot study was to explore possible ultrasound parameters for the early detection of alcohol-mediated fetal somatic and central nervous system (CNS) maldevelopment. Maternal alcohol ingestion during pregnancy may lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which encompass a broad range of structural abnormalities including growth impairment, specific craniofacial features and CNS abnormalities. Early detection of fetuses at risk of FASD would support earlier interventions. Methods: We performed a longitudinal prospective pilot study from 2004 to 2006 at two sites in Ukraine. A sample of pregnant women who reported consuming moderate-to-heavy amounts of alcohol participated in a comprehensive maternal interview, and received ultrasound evaluation of fetal growth and specific fetal brain measurements during the second and third trimesters. These measurements were compared with those collected from a group of pregnant women who consumed little-to-no alcohol during pregnancy, and who were recruited and followed in the same manner. Results: From 6745 screened women, 84 moderate-to-heavy alcohol users and 82 comparison women were identified and ultrasound examinations performed. After controlling for maternal smoking, alcohol-exposed fetuses had shorter mean femur length, caval-calvarial distance and frontothalamic measurements in the second trimester (P < 0.05), and alcohol-exposed fetuses also had shorter frontothalamic distance measurements in the third trimester relative to comparison fetuses (P < 0.05). In addition, after controlling for maternal smoking, both mean orbital diameter and biparietal diameter measurements were significantly smaller on average in the alcohol-exposed group in the third trimester relative to comparison fetuses (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Significant differences in selected somatic and brain measurements were noted between alcoholexposed and comparison fetuses, suggesting these markers may be further explored for clinical utility in prenatal identification of affected children. Further study correlating these findings with alcohol-related physical features of the newborn and subsequent comparisons of neurodevelopmental outcomes will help define potential uses of prenatal ultrasound for intervention and prevention of FASD.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), resulting from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, are associated with significant academic and behavior problems. Although affected children are common in clinical practice, information to guide recommendations about interventions with this high risk group is very limited. This study evaluated the persistence of effects of an intervention on the math performance and behavior of 54 children, 3- to 10-years, diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome or FASD. METHODS: Children were randomly assigned to a 6-week Math intervention (n = 28) tailored to this clinical group or to a standard psychoeducational contrast group (n = 26). All caregivers received identical educational interventions to promote learning readiness and improve behavioral outcomes. In a previous study, participants were assessed before interventions and immediately following completion. In this follow-up study, participants were recontacted and reassessed at 6 months post completion to determine if positive results on math functioning and child behavior would persist after treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: Focus was on 2 outcomes: (1) Math performance, assessed using standardized measures of math achievement and (2) Behavior problems as reported by caregivers on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teachers on the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Experimental-group participants demonstrated significantly greater scores on math outcome measures than Contrast group members and CBCL and TRF behavior was improved over pretest scores in both groups. CONCLUSION: This 6-month follow-up confirms that both math skills and behavior of alcohol-affected children are improved significantly by interventions designed to meet their specific learning and behavior needs. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - This study evaluated the neural basis of verbal working memory (WM) function in a group of 20 children and adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) and 20 typically developing comparison participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both groups showed prominent activation in the frontal-parietal-cerebellar network known to be important for verbal WM. Despite equivalent behavioral performance between groups, alcohol-exposed individuals showed increased activation relative to typically developing individuals in left dorsal frontal and left inferior parietal cortices, and bilateral posterior temporal regions during verbal WM. These effects remained even when group differences on IQ were statistically controlled. This pattern of increased activation coupled with equivalent behavioral performance between groups suggests that individuals with FASD recruit a more extensive network of brain regions during verbal WM relative to typically developing individuals. These findings may suggest that frontal-parietal processing during verbal WM is less effi-cient in alcohol-exposed individuals. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance (MR) technology offers noninvasive methods for in vivo assessment of neuroabnormalities. Methods: A comprehensive neuropsychological/psychiatric battery, coupled with MR imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) assessments, were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the spectrum. The 4 study groups included: (i) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (PFAS); (ii) static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed (SE/AE); (iii) neurobehavioral disorder/alcohol exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed with the FASD 4-Digit Code; and (iv) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure. Presented here are the MRI assessments that were used to compare the sizes of brain regions between the 4 groups. The neuropsychological/behavioral, MRS, and fMRI outcomes are reported separately. Results: Progressing across the 4 study groups from Controls to ND/AE to SE/AE to FAS/PFAS, the mean absolute size of the total brain, frontal lobe, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, cerebellar vermis, and corpus callosum length decreased incrementally and significantly. The FAS/PFAS group (the only group with the 4-Digit FAS facial phenotype) had disproportionately smaller frontal lobes relative to all other groups. The FAS/PFAS and SE/AE groups [the 2 groups with the most severe central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction] had disproportionately smaller caudate regions relative to the ND/AE and Control groups. The prevalence of subjects in the FAS/PFAS, SE/AE, and ND/AE groups that had 1 or more brain regions, 2 or more SDs below the mean size observed in the Control group was 78, 58, and 43%, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between size of brain regions and level of prenatal alcohol exposure, magnitude of FAS facial phenotype, and level of CNS dysfunction. Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging provided further validation that ND/AE, SE/AE, and FAS/PFAS as defined by the FASD 4-Digit Code are 3 clinically distinct and increasingly more affected diagnostic subclassifications under the umbrella of FASD. Neurostructural abnormalities are present across the spectrum. MRI could importantly augment diagnosis of conditions under the umbrella of FASD, once population-based norms for structural development of the human brain are established.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Clinical studies and research in animals have established that alcohol consumption during pregnancy produces irreversible developmental anomalies. Deficits in fine motor performance are often noted in infants diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. However, the effects of alcohol on the spinal motoneurons have not been examined. In this study, the morphometric alterations in spinal motoneurons were assessed as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered with 1.0 ml of 20% ethyl alcohol per 100 gm body weight via intraperitoneal injections, and unexposed rats served as controls. Rats were perfused through the left cardiac ventricle and a complete laminectomy was performed. Spinal cord sections from the L4-5 segments were cut serially and stained for cresyl fast violet. Sections were also subjected to TUNEL assay for detection of apoptosis. Observations were made between 1 and 4 weeks after birth. RESULTS: Morphologic characteristics of motoneurons in the alcoholexposed group of rats were altered. Counts and measurements revealed significant reduction in number and size of alcohol-exposed spinal motoneurons at all time points studied. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to alcohol showed cytotoxic effects whereby it adversely affected both motoneuron growth and differentiation in utero. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Despite decades of research, the aetiology of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD) remains largely unknown. Next to a strong genetic component, increasing evidence suggests additional adverse impact of environmental factors, two of which have, although controversially, withstood meta-analysis: gestational exposure to smoking (OR 2.39) and low birth weight (OR 2.64). Several studies have investigated a possible association between prenatal exposure to alcohol and ADHD, although the matter is complicated due to foetal alcohol syndrome disorders (FASD) with ADHD-like symptoms. Questions: Can an estimate of the effect of gestational exposure to alcohol for ADHD be determined? What is the relevance of primary care services in screening and intervention in mild to moderate drinking in pregnant women? Method: MEDLINE, Cinahl, PsychInfo, EMBASE (1995-2008) were searched for articles in English, supplemented by a manual search. Out of 23 reviewed studies, three were included in the meta-analysis; one further study was added to undertake a sub-analysis comparing severe versus mild alcohol consumption. Summary odds ratios (OR) were extracted and fixed/random-effects meta-analysis were used for combining the OR's. Heterogeneity across the studies was formally assessed using Cochran's Q. Results: An OR of 2.33 (95% CI, 1.18-4.61), (z = 2.43, p = 0.02) suggests that exposed children are 2.33 times more likely to have ADHD than non exposed children. Discussion: Our meta-analysis suggests that children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy are at risk for ADHD. However, evidence is sparse and it remains uncertain whether a causal association exists. Further research is needed into dose-response relationship, timing of exposure, influence of genetic factors involved inmaternal alcohol abuse and the role of FASD in ADHD-like symptoms. If a detrimental effect of mild to moderate drinking on the offspring is supported by stronger evidence, primary care services could have a major role in prevention and early intervention. This would be in addition to their already established role in helping heavy drinking mothers. © 2009 Royal College of General Practitioners.

N2  - Background: Studies concerning whether exposure to low levels of maternal alcohol consumption during fetal development is related to child inattention and hyperactivity symptoms have shown conflicting results. We examine the contribution of covariates related to social adversity to resolve some inconsistencies in the extant research by conducting parallel analyses of three cohorts with varying alcohol consumption and attitudes towards alcohol use. Methods: We compare three population-based pregnancy-offspring cohorts within the Nordic Network on ADHD from Denmark and Finland. Prenatal data were gathered via self-report during pregnancy and birth outcomes were abstracted from medical charts. A total of 21,678 reports concerning inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in children were available from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire or the Rutter Scale completed by parents and/or teachers. Results: Drinking patterns differed cross-nationally. Women who had at least some social adversity (young, low education, or being single) were more likely to drink than those better off in the Finnish cohort, but the opposite was true for the Danish cohorts. Prenatal alcohol exposure was not related to risk for a high inattention-hyperactivity symptom score in children across cohorts after adjustment for covariates. In contrast, maternal smoking and social adversity during pregnancy were independently and consistently associated with an increase in risk of child symptoms. Conclusions: Low doses of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were not related to child inattention/hyperactivity symptoms once social adversity and smoking were taken into account. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

N2  - Background: Previous research has demonstrated that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure affects the size and shape of the corpus callosum (CC) and compromises interhemispheric transfer of information. The aim of this study was to confirm the previous reports of poorer performance on a finger localization test (FLT) of interhemispheric transfer in a cohort of heavily exposed children and to extend these findings to a cohort of moderately exposed young adults. Methods: In Study 1, the FLT was administered to 40 heavily exposed and 23 nonexposed children from the Cape Coloured community of Cape Town, South Africa, who were evaluated for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) dysmorphology and growth. Anatomical images of the CC were obtained using structural MRI on a subset of these children. In Study 2, the FLT was administered to a cohort of 85 moderate-to-heavily exposed young adults participating in a 19-year follow-up assessment of the Detroit Prenatal Alcohol Exposure cohort, whose alcohol exposure had been ascertained prospectively during gestation. Results: In Study 1, children with FAS showed more transfer-related errors than controls after adjustment for confounding, and increased transfer-related errors were associated with volume reductions in the isthmus and splenium of the CC. In Study 2, transfer-related errors were associated with quantity of alcohol consumed per occasion during pregnancy. More errors were made if the mother reported binge drinking (>5 standard drinks) during pregnancy than if she drank regularly (M > 1 drink/day) without binge drinking. Conclusions: These findings confirm a previous report of impaired interhemispheric transfer of tactile information in children heavily exposed to alcohol in utero and extend these findings to show that these deficits are also seen in more moderately exposed individuals, particularly those exposed to binge-like pregnancy drinking. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objective: Efforts to understand specific effects of prenatal methamphetamine (MA) exposure on cognitive processing are hampered by high rates of concomitant alcohol use during pregnancy. We examined whether neurocognitive systems differed among children with differing prenatal teratogenic exposures when they engaged in a verbal memory task. Patients and Methods: Participants (7-15 years) engaged in a verbal paired associate learning task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The MA group included 14 children with prenatal MA exposure, 12 of whom had concomitant alcohol exposure. They were compared with 9 children with prenatal alcohol but not MA exposure (alcohol-exposed only) and 20 unexposed controls. Groups did not differ in age, gender, or socioeconomic status. Participants' IQ and verbal learning performance were measured using standardized instruments. Results: The MA group activated more diffuse brain regions, including bilateral medial temporal structures known to be important for memory, than both the alcohol-exposed only and the CON groups. These group differences remained after IQ was covaried. More activation in medial temporal structures by the MA group compared with the alcohol-exposed only group cannot be explained by performance differences because both groups performed at similar levels on the verbal memory task. Conclusions: More diffuse activation in the MA group during verbal memory may reflect recruitment of compensatory systems to support a weak verbal memory network. Differences in activation patterns between the MA and alcohol-exposed only groups suggest that prenatal MA exposure influences the development of the verbal memory system above and beyond effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Intrauterine environment-genome interaction and children's development (1): Ethanol: A teratogen in developing brain
A1  - Fukui Y.
A1  - Sakata-Haga H.
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Exposure to ethanol during prenatal development can have devastating consequences on developing fetuses, the so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disordres (FASD). Among FASD, cases that exhibit all of three criterion; 1) central nervous system dysfunction, 2) prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and 3) characteristic cranial/facial abnormalities, referred as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children born to drinking mothers may suffer from severe brain damage that is expressed by a variety of behavioral alterations. We examined the effects of ethanol exposure during brain development on brain morphogenesis and circadian rhythm using a rat model. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a liquid diet containing 2.5-5.0% (w/v) ethanol during gestational days 10 to 21. Mean daily ethanol consumption by these dams was 11.53 +/- 2.54 g/kg/day. In rats prenatally exposed to ethanol, ectopias on the cerebral cortex, aberrant distribution of hippocampal mossy fibers, and fusion of cerebellar folia were found. Rats exposed to ethanol during the prenatal or postnatal period suffered from a fragile synchronizing system of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Although the prevalence of FAS in Japan is lower than in the United States, the increasing number of Japanese women with the drinking habit are cause for great concern. However, the preventive action of FAS/FASD has been advanced recently, and now alcoholic beverages carry labels warning of the risk of drinking during pregnancy and breastfeeding of babies. Although little is still known about how ethanol affects brain development, the only and most certain way to prevent FAS/FASD is total abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

N2  - Background There is a lack of evidence regarding the effect of dose, pattern and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and behaviour problems in children aged 2 years and older. Methods A 10% random sample of women delivering a live infant in Western Australia (1995-96) were invited to participate in an 8-year longitudinal survey (78% response rate n = 2224); 85% were followed-up at 2 years, 73% at 5 years and 61% at 8 years. Alcohol consumption was classified by combining the overall dose, dose per occasion and frequency to reflect realistic drinking patterns. Longitudinal analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to investigate the association between child behaviour as measured by the Child Behaviour Checklist at 2, 5 and 8 years of age and prenatal alcohol exposure collected 3 months postpartum for each trimester separately, adjusting for a wide range of confounding factors. Results Low levels of prenatal alcohol were not associated with child behaviour problems. There were increased odds of internalizing behaviour problems following heavy alcohol exposure in the first trimester; anxiety/depression [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-7.43] and somatic complaints (aOR 2.74; 95% CI 1.47-5.12) and moderate levels of alcohol exposure increased the odds of anxiety/depression (aOR 2.24; 95% CI 1.16-4.34). Conclusions Prenatal alcohol exposure at moderate and higher levels increased the odds of child behaviour problems with the dose, pattern and timing of exposure affecting the type of behaviour problems expressed. Larger studies with more power are needed to confirm these findings. © 2009 Society for the Study of Addiction.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to smoking and alcohol increases the risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Physiological changes associated with these exposures are not well studied. Full-term infants were tested within the first 3 days of life. We hypothesized that maternal alcohol consumption and/or smoking during pregnancy would alter autonomic nervous system function. Newborns whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had lower beat-to-beat heart rate variability in quiet sleep. Infants whose mothers consumed alcohol had lower global heart rate variability, but only in active sleep. Unexposed infants demonstrated increases in heart rate with head-up tilt and decreases in heart rate with head-down tilt, but smoking and alcohol-exposed infants showed no significant responses. These results indicate that autonomic function is altered by prenatal exposure to alcohol and smoking. Such markers may provide early identification of infants at greatest risk for SIDS. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - The dentate gyrus (DG) is the central input region to the hippocampus and is known to play an important role in learning and memory. Previous studies have shown that prenatal alcohol is associated with hippocampal-dependent learning deficits and a decreased ability to elicit long-term potentiation (LTP) in the DG in adult animals. Given that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling cascade by NMDA receptors is required for various forms of learning and memory, as well as LTP, in hippocampal regions, including the DG, we hypothesized that fetal alcohol-exposed adult animals would have deficits in hippocampal NMDA receptor-dependent ERK1/2 activation. We used immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry techniques to detect NMDA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in acute hippocampal slices prepared from adult fetal alcohol-exposed mice. We present the first evidence linking prenatal alcohol exposure to deficits in NMDA receptor-dependent ERK1/2 activation specifically in the DG of adult offspring. This deficit may account for the LTP deficits previously observed in the DG, as well as the life-long cognitive deficits, associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2009 International Society for Neurochemistry.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. To describe the clinical features of American Indian children born just before and just after a sibling with fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome. METHODS. Two retrospective case-control studies were conducted of Northern Plains American Indian children with fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome identified from 1981 to 1993 by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 760.71. RESULTS. Compared with the controls, the 39 siblings born just before children with fetal alcohol syndrome (study 1) and 30 siblings born just before children with incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome (study 2) had more facial dysmorphology (23.1% and 16.7%, respectively), growth delay (38.5% and 10.0%), and central nervous system impairment (48.7% and 33.3%). The 20 siblings born just after children with fetal alcohol syndrome (study 1) and 22 siblings born just after children with incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome (study 2) had more facial dysmorphology (20.0% and 9.1%, respectively), growth delay (45.0% and 22.7%), and central nervous system impairment (50.0% and 31.8%) than the control siblings.CONCLUSIONS. The "before" siblings had characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome that could have predicted that the next child was at risk for fetal alcohol syndrome. The "after" siblings had better outcomes than the previous siblings with fetal alcohol syndrome, a finding that was associated with a decrease in maternal alcohol consumption during the after-sibling pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of dose and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure with early language acquisition. METHODS. We examined language delay in a randomly selected, population-based sample of Western Australian children born in 1995-1996 whose mothers had agreed to participate in a longitudinal study on health-related behaviors and who had completed the 2-year questionnaire (N = 1739). Information on alcohol consumption was collected at 3 months after birth for four periods;the three months pre-pregnancy and for each trimester separately. Prenatal alcohol exposure was grouped into none, low, moderate-heavy and binge (>5) based on the total quantity consumed per week, quantity consumed per occasion, and frequency of consumption. The communication scale from the Ages & Stages Questionnaire was used to evaluate language delay. Logistic regression analysis was used to generate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for confounding factors. RESULTS.There was no association between low levels of alcohol consumption and language delay at any time period, although there was a nonsignificant 30% increase in risk when moderate-to-heavy levels of alcohol were consumed in the third trimester. Children exposed to a binge pattern of maternal alcohol consumption in the second trimester had nonsignificant, three-fold increased odds of language delay, with a similar estimate following third trimester alcohol exposure after controlling for covariates. CONCLUSIONS. This study did not detect an association between low levels of prenatal alcohol exposure and language delay when compared with women who abstained from alcohol during pregnancy. A nonsignificant threefold increase in the likelihood of language delay was seen in children whose mothers binged during late pregnancy. However, the small numbers of women with a binge-drinking pattern in late pregnancy limited the power of this study;studies analyzing larger numbers of children exposed to binge drinking in late pregnancy are needed.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of fetal alcohol exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability in the first one and a half years of life. Four models describing the interplay of these factors were assessed: A direct effect model, an interaction or threshold model, a mediational model and a transactional model. Method: A sample of initially 458 women was assessed in a prospective 3-wave study across the first 17 months after childbirth. Fetal alcohol exposure was questioned retrospectively six weeks after birth. Infant irritability was reported by the mothers and fathers. Results: Support for the direct effect model and the interaction model could be found: Fetal alcohol exposure and low emotional support from the husband were associated with increased infant irritability at 5 months. The impact of fetal alcohol exposure was moderated by postnatal depressive symptoms. More irritability was reported if both risk factors, prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal depressive symptoms, were present. Infant irritability and maternal depressive symptoms were associated cross-sectionally. At the age of 17 months only a main effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on irritability could be found. Conclusion: Direct effects of fetal alcohol exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability as well as an interaction between fetal alcohol exposure and maternal depressive symptoms were revealed. The interaction can be understood in terms of a diathesis-stress model. However, no longitudinal associations between maternal depressive symptoms and infant irritability could be found. © 2009 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs), including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, continue to be high-incidence developmental disorders. Detection of patterns of maternal drinking that place fetuses at risk for these disorders is critical to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, but is challenging and often insufficient during pregnancy. Various screens and measures have been used to identify maternal risk drinking but their ability to predict child outcome has been inconsistent. This study hypothesized that a metric of fetal "at-risk" alcohol exposure (ARAE) derived from several indicators of maternal self-reported drinking would predict alcohol-related neurobehavioral dysfunctions in children better than individual measures of maternal alcohol consumption alone. Methods: Self-reported peri-conceptional and repeated maternal drinking during pregnancy were assessed with semi-structured interviews and standard screens, i.e., the CAGE, T-ACE, and MAST, in a prospective sample of 75 African-American mothers. Drinking volumes per beverage type were converted to standard quantity and frequency measures. From these individual measures and screening instruments, a simple dichotomous index of prenatal ARAE was defined and used to predict neurobehavioral outcomes in the 4- to 5-year-old offspring of these women. Study outcomes included IQ, attention, memory, visual-motor integration, fine motor skill, and behavior. Statistical analyses controlled for demographic and other potential confounders. Results: The current "at-risk" drinking metric identified over 62% of the mothers as drinking at risk levels - 23% more than the selection criterion identified - and outperformed all individual quantity and frequency consumption measures, including averages of weekly alcohol use and "binge" alcohol exposures (assessed as intake per drinking occasion), as well as an estimate of the Maternal Substance Abuse Checklist (Coles et al., 2000), in predicting prenatal alcohol-related cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in 4- to 5-year-old children. Conclusions: A metric reflecting multiple indices of "at-risk" maternal alcohol drinking in pregnancy had greater utility in predicting various prenatal alcohol-related neurobehavioral dysfunction and deficits in children compared to individual measures of maternal self-reported alcohol consumption or a previous maternal substance abuse index. Assessing fetal risk drinking in pregnant women was improved by including multiple indicators of both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences and, if appropriate practical applications are devised, may facilitate intervention by health care workers during pregnancy and potentially reduce the incidence or severity of FASDs.

N2  - Aim: To identify factors contributing to growth failure in international adoptees (IAs) from Eastern Europe. Study design: 138 IAs from Eastern Europe, 6-59 months old, were evaluated within 3 weeks of US arrival. Complete history, anthropometry, and serum for growth factors were obtained. Facial features were examined for risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. Results: Upon arrival, mean height (-1.23 +/- 1.07), weight (-1.43 +/- 1.29), and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) (-0.63+/-1.10) SDS in las were significantly less than population means for US children. In a multiple regression model, age, low birth weight (LBW), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, and high risk for fetal alcohol syndrome were independent predictors of height SDS. LBW also independently predicted lower weight SDS and smaller OFC SDS. Conclusions: We recommend that IAs undergo screening upon US arrival to identify risk factors for poor growth, particularly evidence of LBW and fetal alcohol exposure. Catch-up growth should be monitored in all children following adoption. © Freund Publishing House Ltd., London.

T1  - Sonic hedgehog ligand partners with caveolin-1 for intracellular transport

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is the most common environmental factor leading to congenital birth defects in the United States. Although significant progress has been made in this field, the detailed molecular pathology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) remains to be determined. Previously, we have shown that alcohol exposure perturbs hedgehog signal transduction in zebrafish embryos by inhibiting the post-translational cholesterol modification of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), leading to decreased levels of mature Shh ligand that is associated with the plasma membrane, and causing transient loss of Hh signaling, resulting in permanent FAS-related morphological abnormalities. In the present study, we further elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the intracellular transportation and secretion of Shh using the hepatic stellate cell line HSC8B. We have found that Shh is associated with caveolin-1 in the Golgi apparatus to form protein complexes and that these complexes are packaged as large punctuate structures (transport vesicles) that are transported to the plasma membrane in lipid raft microdomains. Alcohol exposure does not significantly interrupt translation of shh mRNA in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the trafficking of Shh from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. However, alcohol does prevent the entry of Shh into transport vesicles from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and specifically decreases the amount of caveolin-1/Shh complex found in lipid rafts, causing cytoplasmic accumulation of Shh and leading to a deficiency of Shh ligand secretion into the extracellular matrix. © 2009 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized by physical deformities and learning and memory deficits. The chick hippocampus, whose functions are controlled by interneurons expressing calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR), is involved in learning and memory mechanisms. Effects on growth and development and hippocampal morphology were studied in chick embryos exposed to 5% and 10% ethanol volume/volume (vol/vol) for 2 or 8 days of gestation. There was a significant dose-dependent reduction (P < .05) in body weight and mean number per section of PV and CR expressing hippocampal neurons in ethanol-exposed chicks, without alterations in neuronal nuclear size or hippocampal volume, compared appropriate controls. Moreover, when chicks exposed to 5% ethanol for 2 and 8 days of gestation were compared, no significant differences were found in body parameters or neuronal counts. Similarly, exposure to 10% ethanol did not induce any significant changes in chicks exposed for 2 or 8 gestational days. Thus, these results suggest that gestational ethanol exposure induces a reduction in the mean number per section of PV and CR expressing hippocampal neurons, and could be a possible mechanism responsible for learning and memory disorders in FAS. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Exposure to alcohol during gestation is associated with CNS alterations, cognitive deficits, and behavior problems. This study investigated microstructural aspects of putative white matter abnormalities following prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess white matter microstructure in 27 youth (age range: 8 to 18 years) with (n = 15) and without (n = 12) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Voxelwise analyses, corrected for multiple comparisons, compared fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between groups, throughout the cerebrum. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with low FA in multiple cerebral areas, including the body of the corpus callosum and white matter innervating bilateral medial frontal and occipital lobes. Fewer between-group differences in MD were observed. Conclusions: These data provide an account of cerebral white matter microstructural integrity in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and support extant literature showing that white matter is a target of alcohol teratogenesis. The white matter anomalies characterized in this study may relate to the neurobehavioral sequelae associated with gestational alcohol exposure, especially in areas of executive dysfunction and visual processing deficits. © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: The study examined whether prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with increased motor timing variability when the timing response is partitioned into central clock variability, which indexes information processing at the central nervous system (CNS) level and motor delay variability, which reflects timing processes at the level of the peripheral nervous system. Methods: Eighteen children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and 22 control children were assigned to young (7 to 11 years) or older (12 to 17 years) groups. Children tapped a single response key with the index finger in synchrony with a series of externally generated tones (the paced phase). At the conclusion of these tones, children continued tapping (the continuation phase) while attempting to maintain the same rate of tapping imposed by the paced phase. Two blocks of tapping were completed with inter-tone-intervals set at either 400 or 900 milliseconds. Inter-response interval, central clock variability, and motor delay variability produced during the continuation phase were the dependent variables. Results: Mean inter-response interval for the 4 groups did not differ for either time interval. Central clock variability produced by the young alcohol-exposed group was significantly greater than the two older groups for the 400 millisecond interval and all other groups for the 900 millisecond interval. Motor delay variability produced by the young alcohol-exposed group was significantly greater than the other three groups for both time intervals. Central and motor delay variability in children with and without alcohol exposure was directly related to the duration of the interval to be reproduced. Conclusions: Central and peripheral timing variability was significantly greater for the young alcohol-exposed children. This atypical timing may be related to the teratogenic effects of alcohol, although the negative effects are limited to younger alcohol-exposed children since there were no differences in central and peripheral timing variability between the older alcohol-exposed children and controls. © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Seizures are often found in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, but it is not known whether binge drinking during pregnancy by nonalcoholic women is associated with an increased risk of seizure disorders in children. The authors conducted a population-based cohort study of 80,526 liveborn singletons in the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996-2002). Information on maternal binge drinking (intake of >5 drinks on a single occasion) was collected in 2 computer-assisted telephone interviews during pregnancy. Children were followed for up to 8 years. Information on neonatal seizures, epilepsy, and febrile seizures was retrieved from the Danish National Hospital Register. Results showed that exposure to binge drinking episodes during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of seizure disorders in children, except for those exposed at 11-16 gestational weeks. These children had a 3.15-fold increased risk of neonatal seizures (95% confidence interval: 1.37, 7.25) and a 1.81-fold increased risk of epilepsy (95% confidence interval: 1.13, 2.90). These findings suggest that maternal binge drinking during a specific time period of pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of specific seizure disorders in the offspring. The results are exploratory, however, and need to be replicated. © The Author 2008. Published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Cell death and differentiations are the critical processes in developing fetal brain, where ethanol induces lots of changes in gene expression patterns of fetal nervous system leading to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The objective of the present study was to observe whether maternal ethanol exposure can alter gene expression pattern in mother and in fetus during mid and late prenatal stage. Material/Methods: 10% ethanol was orally applied to female Spraque-Dawley rats and fetuses were sacrificed on gestational day (GD) 19.5 and 21.5. Total mRNA was isolated for differential-display PCR (DD-PCR) and sequence was analyzed to find out the homologous gene(s) using GenBank database of the BLAST program. Finally, the gene expression pattern in different maternal and fetal brain areas of the control and the ethanol treated groups were studied by RNase protection assay (RPA) and in situ hybridization. Results: Out of several differentially expressed genes, apoptosis-related RNA binding protein (RBP), 'Napor-3' mRNA expression was significantly inhibited by ethanol in fetal rat fore-, mid- and hind- brain, and adult rat cortex and hippocampus when compared with the untreated control. The cDNA analysis was further supported our result (accession: AF090697, 95% sequence homology). Conclusions: The age and area dependent suppression of apoptosis-related RBP, Napor-3 gene expression in proliferating fetal brain by maternal ethanol suggesting high susceptibility towards ethanol intake at the time of neuronal cell development and proliferation. Further, ethanol also affects maternal brain tissues that may be one of the reasons for ethanol-induce irreversible damage of the developing brain. The present study for the first time provides the evidence that Napor-3 suppression by ethanol during mid and late stage fetal brain converts natural physiological event apoptosis into pathological process, which may be useful as a novel therapeutic approach towards FAS-associated developmental brain damage as a consequence of maternal drinking behavior. © Med Sci Monit, 2009.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal growth and preterm birth and to estimate the effect of dose and timing of alcohol exposure in pregnancy. Design: A population-based cohort study linked to birth information on the Western Australian Midwives Notification System. Setting: Western Australia. Population: A 10% random sample of births restricted to nonindigenous women who had delivered a singleton infant (n = 4719) in 1995-1997. Methods: The impact of alcohol consumption in pregnancy on fetal growth (small-for-gestational-age [SGA] and large-for-gestational-age infants [LGA]) and preterm birth (<37 weeks of gestation) was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis and adjusting for confounding factors. Main outcome measures: Odds ratios and 95% CI, attributable risk, and population attributable risk were calculated. Results: The percentage of SGA infants and preterm birth increased with higher levels of prenatal alcohol exposure; however, the association between alcohol intake and SGA infants was attenuated after adjustment for maternal smoking. Low levels of prenatal alcohol were not associated with preterm birth; however, binge drinking resulted in a nonsignificant increase in odds. Preterm birth was associated with moderate and higher levels of prenatal alcohol consumption for the group of women who ceased drinking before the second trimester. This group of women was significantly more likely to deliver a preterm infant than women who abstained from alcohol (adjusted OR 1.73 [95% CI 1.01-3.14]). Conclusions: Alcohol intake at higher levels, particularly heavy and binge drinking patterns, is associated with increased risk of preterm birth even when drinking is ceased before the second trimester. This finding, however, is based on small numbers and needs further investigation. Dose and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure appears to affect preterm delivery and should be considered in future research and health education. © 2009 The Authors.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Mediators of susceptibility to alcohol-related toxicity in the prenatal environment are relatively unknown. The placenta has been proposed as a potential source of variability in the fetal environment, primarily through its significant metabolic capabilities. Meconium is a toxicological matrix unique to the developing fetus that offers an opportunity to quantify fetal exposure to alcohol through the analysis of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) [nonoxidative ethanol metabolites]. Objective: To explore the role of the placenta as a potential source of variability in mediating fetal alcohol exposure via meconium analysis of FAEE, by combining a clinical case report involving human dizygotic twins and a series of guinea pig littermates. Methods: Meconium was collected from a pair of dizygotic twins with clinical suspicion of prenatal alcohol exposure and analyzed for FAEE to confirm prenatal alcohol exposure. Meconium was also collected from a series of guinea pig pups prenatally exposed to alcohol at a daily dose of 4 g/kg/day administered to the pregnant dam. FAEE levels were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection following liquid-liquid extraction from meconium. Results: The dizygotic twin pair yielded positive meconium FAEE results (>2.00 nmoL/g) in the female twin (2.21 nmoL/g) and no detectable FAEE in the male twin. A total of 15 meconium samples were collected from 15 pups of five pregnant guinea pig litters. With the exception of one pair of littermates, meconium FAEE concentrations differed substantially within each litter (FAEE expressed in units of nmoL/g): litter 1 (0.996, 4.43, 1.36); litter 2 (5.17, 4.15, 0.00); litter 3 (5.16, 5.27); litter 4 (18.57, 8.26, 7.46); litter 5 (0.00, 4.32, 0.00, 1.27). Conclusions: Identical maternal ethanol exposure levels produced differing levels of fetal exposure in a dizygotic human twin pair and a series of guinea pig littermates as evidenced through FAEE meconium analysis. These data indicate that the placenta may have a previously unappreciated role in mediating ethanol-induced fetal injury. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

N2  - Aims: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing fetus. Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL/6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). Methods: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation, mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD); non-intubated control (NIC) litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 150 days of age. Results: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores. Conclusions: Mice are an excellent organism to studygenetic influences on many phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on behavior in mice. It appears as if the prenatal period in mice, corresponding to organogenesis, is not a sensitive period for producing behavioral deficits following ethanol exposure. It is likely that the first 2 weeks postnatally, corresponding to the brain growth spurt, are more sensitive for producing behavioral effects. © The Author 2008.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)is the leading cause of mental retardation worldwide but is also the foremost preventable cause of neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities. It is equally important to know spectrum of disorders due to maternal alcoholism during pregnancy such as Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD)in order to identify and treat affected child and family effectively. This article aims to create awareness among practising clinicians most of whom are only aware of phenotypical variant of FASD which is FAS.In this article we discuss those aspects of FASD relevant to the clinician such as: terminological ambiguity, assessment, diagnosis and prevention. © 2009 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a major cause of mental retardation in Western countries. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is mainly characterized by pre- and postnatal stunted growth, neurocognitive disorders, and facial dysmorphism. It compromises the intellectual and behavioral prognosis of the child. Prevention tools exist, through better information of health professionals, for optimal care of high-risk women before, during, and after pregnancy, which would decrease the incidence of SAF in the future. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

T1  - GSK3beta in ethanol neurotoxicity
A1  - Luo J.
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health problem and may result in a wide range of adverse outcomes for the child. The developing central nervous system (CNS) is particularly susceptible to ethanol toxicity. Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments. FASD currently represents the leading cause of mental retardation in North America ahead of Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Ethanol exposure during development causes multiple abnormalities in the brain such as permanent loss of neurons, ectopic neurons, and alterations in synaptogenesis and myelinogenesis. These alcohol-induced structural alterations in the developing brain underlie many of the behavioral deficits observed in FASD. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of ethanol neurotoxicity, however, remain unclear. Ethanol elicits cellular stresses, including oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, responds to various cellular stresses. GSK3beta is particularly abundant in the developing CNS, and regulates diverse developmental events in the immature brain, such as neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, migration, and survival. Available evidence indicates that the activity of GSK3beta in the CNS is affected by ethanol. GSK3beta inhibition provides protection against ethanol neurotoxicity, whereas high GSK3beta activity/expression sensitizes neuronal cells to ethanol-induced damages. It appears that GSK3beta is a converging signaling point that mediates some of ethanol's neurotoxic effects. © 2009 Humana Press Inc.

N2  - Alcohol-exposed pregnancy is a leading cause of preventable birth defects in the United States. This paper describes the motivational patterns that relate to risky drinking and ineffective contraception, two behaviors that can result in alcohol-exposed pregnancy. As part of an intervention study aimed at reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancy 124 women were recruited and reported demographic characteristics, readiness to change, stages of change, drinking, contraception, and sexual behavior history. Our results showed the following. Drinking: A significant positive correlation was found between the number of drinks consumed in 90 days and the Importance to reduce drinking (r = .23, p = .008). A significant negative correlation between number of drinks and confidence to reduce drinking (r = -.39, p = .000) was found as well. Significant differences were found in the total number of drinks consumed in 90 days between the five stages of change (F = (4,118), 3.12, p = .01). Women in Preparation reported drinking a significantly higher number of drinks than women in other stages of change. Contraception: There were significant negative correlations between ineffective contraception and Importance (r = -.38, p = .00), confidence (r = -.20, p = .02) and Readiness (r = -.43, p = .00) to use contraception effectively. Significant differences in contraception ineffectiveness were found for women in different stages of change (F = (4,115) 8.58, p = .000). Women in Precontemplation reported significantly higher levels of contraception ineffectiveness compared to women in other stages of change. Results show a clear relationship between higher alcohol consumption and higher levels of motivation to reduce drinking. In contrast, higher levels of ineffective contraception were related to lower levels of motivation to use contraception effectively. This suggests risky drinking may be better targeted with brief skills building interventions and ineffective contraception may require interventions that enhance problem awareness and motivation. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Children prenatally exposed to tobacco have been found to exhibit increased rates of behavior problems related to response inhibition deficits. The present study compared the brain function of tobacco-exposed (n = 7) and unexposed (n = 11) 12-year-olds during a Go/No-Go response inhibition task using an event-related functional MRI (fMRI) design. Prenatal alcohol exposure, neonatal medical problems, environmental risk, IQ, current environmental smoke exposure, and handedness were statistically controlled. Tobacco-exposed children showed greater activation in a relatively large and diverse set of regions, including left frontal, right occipital, and bilateral temporal and parietal regions. In contrast, unexposed but not exposed children showed activation in the cerebellum, which prior research has indicated is important for attention and motor preparation. The diversity of regions showing greater activation among tobacco-exposed children suggests that their brain function is characterized by an inefficient recruitment of regions required for response inhibition. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Two previous studies comparing the Quick Drinking Screen (QDS) with the Timeline Followback (TLFB) found that these two instruments yielded similar reports of alcohol use for clinical and nonclinical populations of problem drinkers. The current study evaluated the correspondence between these two drinking measures with women at risk of an Alcohol-Exposed Pregnancy (AEP). Participants were 355 women who voluntarily participated in a research study during 2005 through 2007 designed to prevent AEPs. All women were screened by phone for eligibility using the QDS and approximately 2 weeks later completed a 3-month TLFB by mail. Results of this study, analyzed in 2008, paralleled previous studies showing that the QDS and the TLFB, two very different drinking measures, collected similar aggregate drinking data for women who drink heavily and are at risk of an AEP. Correspondence between the two drinking measures met acceptable levels of reliability. The present study found that the QDS has demonstrated efficacy for screening women whose level of alcohol use puts them at risk for an AEP. Although the QDS does not yield detailed drinking information, it could be used when it is not possible or necessary to gather daily drinking data. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Genetic and environmental contributions to the observed correlations among DSM-IV ADHD problems [inattentive (INATT) and hyperactive/impulsive (HYP/IMP) behaviors], conduct problems (CDP) and alcohol problems (AlcProb) were examined by fitting multivariate structural equation models to data from the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study [N = 2892 twins (831 monozygotic pairs, 615 dizygotic pairs)]. Based on results of preliminary regression models, we modified the structural model to jointly estimate (i) the regression of each phenotype on significant familial/prenatal predictors, and (ii) genetic and environmental contributions to the residual variance and covariance. Results suggested that (i) parental risk factors, such as parental alcohol dependence and regular smoking, increase risk for externalizing behavior; (ii) prenatal exposures predicted increased symptomatology for HYP/IMP (smoking during pregnancy), INATT and CDP (prenatal alcohol exposure); (iii) after adjusting for measured familial/prenatal risk factors, genetic influences were significant for HYP/IMP, INATT, and CDP; however, similar to earlier reports, genetic effects on alcohol dependence symptoms were negligible; and (iv) in adolescence, correlated liabilities for conduct and alcohol problems are found in environmental factors common to both phenotypes, while covariation among impulsivity, inattention, and conduct problems is primarily due to genetic influences common to these three behaviors. Thus, while a variety of adolescent problem behaviors are significantly correlated, the structure of that association may differ as a function of phenotype (e.g., comorbid HYP/IMP and CDP vs. comorbid CDP and AlcProb), a finding that could inform different approaches to treatment and prevention. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Magnetic resonance (MR) technology offers noninvasive methods for in vivo assessment of neuroabnormalities. A comprehensive neuropsychological/behavioral, MR imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS) and functional MRI (fMRI) assessment was administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine whether global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified and to distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the spectrum. The four study groups included (1) FAS/partial FAS; (2) static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed (SE/AE); (3) neurobehavioral disorder/alcohol exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed with the FASD 4-Digit Code; and (4) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure. Results are presented in four separate reports: MRS (reported here) and neuropsychological/behavioral, MRI and fMRI outcomes (reported separately). MRS was used to compare neurometabolite concentrations [choline (Cho), n-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and creatine (Cre)] in a white matter region and a hippocampal region between the four study groups. Choline concentration in the frontal/parietal white matter region, lateral to the midsection of the corpus callosum, was significantly lower in FAS/PFAS relative to all other study groups. Choline decreased significantly with decreasing frontal white matter volume and corpus callosum length. These outcomes suggest low choline concentrations may reflect white matter deficits among FAS/PFAS. Choline also decreased significantly with increasing severity of the 4-Digit FAS facial phenotype, increasing impairment in psychological performance and increasing alcohol exposure. NAA and Cre concentrations did not vary significantly. This study provides further evidence of the vulnerability of the cholinergic system in FASD. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can damage the fetal brain and lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Despite public warnings discouraging alcohol use during pregnancy, many pregnant women continue to drink intermittently because they do not believe that occasional exposures to alcohol can be harmful to a fetus. However, because of genetic differences, some fetuses are much more susceptible than others to alcohol-induced brain injury. Thus, a relatively low quantity of alcohol that may be innocuous to most fetuses could damage a genetically susceptible fetus. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) can protect developing mouse neurons against alcohol toxicity by synthesizing neuroprotective nitric oxide. This study examined whether a single exposure to alcohol, which causes no evident injury in wild type mice, can damage the brains of mice genetically deficient for nNOS (nNOS-/- mice). Wild type and nNOS-/- mice received intraperitoneal injections of alcohol (0.0, 2.2, or 4.4 mg/g body weight) either as a single dose on postnatal day (PD) 4 or as repeated daily doses over PD4-9. Brain volumes and neuronal numbers within the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were determined on PD10. Alcohol exposure on PD4-9 restricted brain growth and caused neuronal death in both strains of mice, but the severity of microencephaly and neuronal loss were more severe in the nNOS-/- mice than in wild type. The 4.4 mg/g alcohol dose administered on PD4 alone caused significant neuronal loss and microencephaly in the nNOS-/- mice, while this same dose caused no evident injury in the wild type mice. Thus, during development, a single exposure to alcohol can injure a genetically vulnerable brain, while it leaves a wild type brain unaffected. Since the genes that confer alcohol resistance and vulnerability in developing humans are unknown, any particular human fetus is potentially vulnerable. Thus, women should be counseled to consume no alcohol during pregnancy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: As executive dysfunctions frequently accompany alcohol dependence, we suggest that reports of executive dysfunction in alcoholics are actually due, in some case to a maternal history of alcohol misuse (MHA+). A history of maternal alcohol dependence increases the risk for prenatal alcohol exposure to unborn children. These exposures likely contribute to executive dysfunction in adult alcoholics. To assess this problem, we propose a case-comparison study of alcohol-dependent subjects with and without a MHA. Methods: Ten alcohol-dependent subjects, with a maternal history of alcoholism (MHA) and paternal history of alcoholism (PHA), were matched with 10 alcohol-dependent people with only a paternal history of alcoholism (PHA). Executive functions (cancellation, Stroop, and trail-making A and B tests) and the presence of a history of three mental disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, violent behavior while intoxicated, and suicidal behavior) were evaluated in both populations. Results: Alcohol-dependent subjects with MHA showed a significant alteration in executive functions and significantly more disorders related to these functions than PHA subjects. The major measures of executive functioning deficit are duration on task accomplishment in all tests. Rates of ADHD and suicidality were found to be higher in MHA patients compared to the controls. Conclusion: A history of MHA, because of the high risk of PAE (in spite of the potential confounding factors such as environment) must be scrupulously documented when evaluating mental and cognitive disorders in a general population of alcoholics to ensure a better identification of these disorders. It would be helpful to replicate the study with more subjects. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

T1  - Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein-derived peptide, NAP, preventing alcohol-induced apoptosis in fetal brain of C57BL/6 mouse
A1  - Sari Y.
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Possible prevention of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure has been investigated using peptides that were previously shown to be involved in neuroprotection both in vitro and in vivo. I focused in this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects of one of these peptides with regard to the determination of the downstream signaling pathways involved in neuroprotection. This peptide with the sequence NAPVSIPQ, known as NAP, a fragment of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, demonstrated a potent protective effect against oxidative stress associated with alcohol exposure. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched C57BL/6 pregnant females were assigned the following groups: (1) Ethanol liquid diet group (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v) ethano-derived calories, (2) Pair-fed (PF) control group (3) Chow control group, (4) treatment groups with alcohol alongside i.p. injections of d-NAP (ALC/d-NAP, 20 or 30 mug/20 g body weight), (5) PF/d-NAP control group. On E13, fetal brains were collected and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, caspase-3 colorimetric assay and ELISA for cytochrome c detection. My results show that NAP significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of the fetal brain. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP administration significantly prevented alcohol-induced increases in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium cingulate cortex and basal ganglia eminence. The investigation of downstream signaling pathways involving NAP neuroprotection revealed that this peptide significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in the concentrations of caspase-3 in E13 fetal brains. Moreover, ELISA for cytochrome c shows that NAP significantly prevented both alcohol-induced increases in the level of cytosolic cytochrome c and alcohol-induced decreases in the level of mitochondrial cytochrome c. These data provide an understanding of NAP intracellular target, and the downstream mechanisms of action that will pave a path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during prenatal stages. © 2009 IBRO.

N2  - The aims of this study were to evaluate the language abilities of young children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and to determine if these abilities represent a relative strength or weakness for this population. Two matched groups of children (ages 3 to 5) completed the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Preschool version: 25 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) and 26 non-exposed controls (CON). Consistent with previous research, the CON group had significantly higher full scale IQ (FSIQ) scores than the ALC group. Receptive and expressive language skills of the two groups were compared. The ALC group had significantly poorer language skills than the CON group and both groups had better receptive than expressive abilities. Language performance did not significantly deviate from what would be predicted by FSIQ for either group. These results indicate that receptive and expressive language abilities are impaired in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure but not more so than general intellectual functioning. However, these deficits are likely to impact the social interactions and behavioral adjustment of children with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the likelihood that women of different racial and ethnic groups would reduce their alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Methods: Data came from 22 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System from 2001 to 2005. After stratifying the sample by preconception drinking level, logistic regressions were used to predict drinking reduction and cessation by the third trimester by race, controlling for age, education, marital status, Medicaid status, pregnancy intention, smoking status, and state. Results: Overall, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic women were all significantly less likely than White women to reduce their heavy drinking after becoming pregnant. American Indian/Alaskan Native women who were moderate drinkers before conception were over 2 times more likely than White women to reduce drinking after becoming pregnant (OR 2.19, CI 0.71, 6.76), although this difference was non-significant (P = .17). Among those who binge drank in the months before pregnancy, compared to White women, Black (OR 0.26, CI 0.17-0.39), Hispanic (OR 0.19, CI 0.12-0.29), American Indian/Alaskan Native (OR 0.44 CI 0.20, 0.96), and Asian/Pacific Islander women (OR 0.11, CI 0.06-0.22) were all less likely to quit binge drinking while pregnant. Conclusion: Significant racial differences in pregnancy-related drinking reduction are evident, and may help explain racial disparities in FAS. Results suggest that more targeted efforts are needed to meet the national goals of preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can affect brain development, leading to behavioral problems, including overactivity, motor dysfunction and learning deficits. Despite warnings about the effects of drinking during pregnancy, rates of fetal alcohol syndrome remain unchanged and thus, there is an urgent need to identify interventions that reduce the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is neuroprotective against ethanol-related toxicity and promotes white matter production following a number of insults. Given that prenatal alcohol leads to cell death and white matter deficits, the present study examined whether IGF-I could reduce the severity of behavioral deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure. Sprague-Dawley rat pups received ethanol intubations (5.25 g/kg/day) or sham intubations on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester. On PD 10-13, subjects from each treatment received 0 or 10 mug IGF-I intranasally each day. Subjects were then tested on a series of behavioral tasks including open field activity (PD 18-21), parallel bar motor coordination (PD 30-32) and Morris maze spatial learning (PD 45-52). Ethanol exposure produced overactivity, motor coordination impairments, and spatial learning deficits. IGF-I treatment significantly mitigated ethanol's effects on motor coordination, but not on the other two behavioral tasks. These data indicate that IGF-I may be a potential treatment for some of ethanol's damaging effects, a finding that has important implications for children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Results: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 1% to 14% of pregnancies, resulting in adverse maternal and fetal effects. Current evidence suggests that the incidence of GDM increased in the 1990s, concurrent with the rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes in the general population. The purpose of this study was to calculate the percentage of GDM attributable to overweight and obesity. We analyzed data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a population-based surveillance system that collects data on self-reported maternal behaviors throughout pregnancy, in seven states that had implemented the 2003 revised birth certificate by 2006. Logistic regression was used to assess the independent contribution of prepregnancy BMI (kilograms/meters2) to GDM, controlling for potential confounders. We then calculated the sample weighted population attributable fraction (PAF) of GDM due to overweight and/or obesity. Data were weighted to adjust for survey design, noncoverage, and nonresponse. The overall GDM prevalence was 4.0 % (0.2 SE), ranging from 3.1% (0.4) in Florida to 5.0% (0.8) in Ohio. When examined by BMI categories (underweight [13-18.4], normal [18.5-24.9], overweight [25-29.9], obese [30-34.9], and extremely obese [35-64.9]), GDM prevalence was 1.0%, 2.3%, 5.0%, 5.5%, and 10.4%, respectively. The unadjusted relative risks (RR) of developing GDM were 2.2 (95% CI 1.6-2.8), 2.4 (1.8-3.2), 4.5 (3.4-6.0) for overweight, obese, and extremely obese women using normal as a reference group. The RR did not change after adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, marital status, and parity. The fractions of GDM attributable to overweight, obesity, and extreme obesity, were 15.7% (95% CI 9.5-21.9), 9.7% (5.7-13.6), and 18.7% (13.9-23.5), respectively. The overall PAF was 44.0% (35.0-53.1). Our results suggest that if all women with BMI > 25 had a GDM risk equal to that of women in the normal BMI category, 44.0% of GDM could be prevented. Lifestyle interventions to reduce BMI have the potential to lower GDM risk. Therefore, public health efforts to promote physical activity and healthy diets among women of reproductive age should be intensified.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although a relation has been identified between heavy levels of maternal; alcohol consumption during pregnancy and spontaneous abortion, a recent review identified no evidence of effects for low-moderate levels of exposure. We examined the impact of moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure on rate of spontaneous abortion in a prospective cohort. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal pregnancy alcohol consumption was assessed in African American women (n=431). At each prenatal visit, women were queried about alcohol intake during the prior 2 weeks. From this interview, three alcohol-drinking measures were obtained: ounces of absolute alcohol per day (AAD: mean = 0.32; SD=0.6), ounces of absolute alcohol per drinking day (AADD; mean=2.5, SD=2.6), and proportion of drinking days per week (PDD; mean=0.1; SD=0.11). The outcome variable spontaneous abortion was dichotomized (yes/no). Data were analyzed using analyses of variance and logistic regression. RESULTS: On average women began their prenatal care during the 16th week of pregnancy. 3.2% of the women spontaneously aborted during the 1st trimester; while 2.5% aborted after their 13 week of pregnancy. Higher rates of spontaneous abortion were observed in women who drank more on average during pregnancy (AAD: p<0.001) and among women who drank more often during the week (PDD: p<0.001). The quantity of alcohol consumed on those days when a women drank was unrelated to miscarriage rate (AADD: p=0.20). Women who reported drinking 1 day per week were 1.89 times more likely to abort than abstainers; drinking two days per week increased this to rate 3.57 times; 3 days = 6.74 times. CONCLUSION: There was a significant relation between frequency of alcohol consumption and average alcohol intake across pregnancy and increased rates of spontaneous abortion in this urban African American cohort. Contrary to recent reviews, binge drinking during pregnancy was unrelated to spontaneous abortion rates. Although a threshold of 3 drinks per week has been suggested (Henderson et al., 2007), our results suggest the risk level may be much lower.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation.Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that plays an important role in neuronal development and survival as well as in synaptic and morphological plasticity. Our objective was to delineate BDNF expression during embryonic development and evaluate if prenatal alcohol exposure effects BDNF expression in mouse embryos and young-adult mouse brains. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or placebo. Embryos were harvested at 6h(E8), 24h(E9), day 10(E18) and pups at postnatal day 40 (PND40). Each sample included at least 3 embryos or brains, representing at least 3 litters per time point. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time PCR was performed to quantify BDNF with HPRT1 standardization. Statistics included ANOVA and Fisher PLSD. RESULTS: BDNF expression was higher in E8 compared to E9 and E18 in control embryos. At 6h, BDNF expression in the alcohol-exposed embryos was lower than in controls (P<.05); at 24h and E18 BDNF was higher in the alcohol-exposed embryos than the controls (all P<.05). We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults hippocampus and cortex (all P>.05). {Figure presented} CONCLUSION: Prenatal alcohol exposure during development induces a decrease in BDNF expression 6h after the alcohol exposure and an increase after 24h and 10 days, without differences in the young-adult brain. Alterations in BDNF expression during development may underlie some of the of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation; prenatal alcohol exposure affects the development of the nervous system. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that is essential in normal neuronal development and survival as well as synaptic plasticity, an important factor in learning and memory. Previously, we have shown that prenatal treatment with neuroprotective peptides, NAP+SAL, prevented alcohol induced fetal anomalies and learning deficits. Our objective was to evaluate if NAP+SAL's neuroprotective effects are mediated by preventing alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression during embryonic development. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides (20g, 30 min before alcohol). Embryos were harvested at 6h(E8), 24h(E9) and day 10(E18). Each sample included at least 3 embryos, representing at least 3 litters per time point. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time PCR was performed to quantify BDNF with HPRT1 standardization. Statistics included ANOVA and Fisher PLSD. RESULTS: At 6h pretreatment with NAP + SAL did not prevent the alcohol-induced decline in BDNF (P=0.9). However, pretreatment with the peptides NAP+SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P<0.05) at 24h and E18. {Figure presented} CONCLUSION: NAP+SAL prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24h and 10 days after alcohol exposure. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies and learning deficits in fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Introduction: Human victims of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) and rodents treated with alcohol during perinatal period exhibit sleep abnormalities that may extend into adulthood, but the underlying neural substrate(s) are unknown. We investigated whether early AE alters GABAergic system in hypothalamic regions important for the regulation of sleep and motor activity. Methods: Male rats received 5.25 g/kg/day of alcohol via intragastric intubations during postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period equivalent to human brain development during the third trimester of pregnancy (AE group). Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). On PD15-16, total RNA and protein were bilaterally extracted from 700 mu tissue micropunches from the wake-promoting, perifornical (PF) region of the posterior hypo- thalamus and sleep-promoting, ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) region of the anterior hypothalamus. GAD levels (mRNA and protein) and mRNA levels for eleven subunits of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) were quantified using RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively (n=5-7/group). In additional animals (n=9-10/group), motor activity was recorded for 30 min using infrared beam-splitting technique. Results: In the PF region, GAD65/67 immunoreactivity and GAD67 mRNA levels were significantly lower (by 44% and 24%, respectively; p<0.01 for both), and in the VLPO region, GAD65/67 immunoreactivity (but not mRNA) was lower (by 8%; p<0.05) in the AE group. GABAAR alpha4 and sigma subunit mRNA levels were higher in the PF region and alpha3 and ;2 subunit mRNA levels were higher in the VLPO region (p<0.05) in the AE group. The total number of movements was significantly higher in AE than S rats (by 36%; p<0.05). Conclusion: Perinatal AE results in reduced levels of hypothalamic GABA enzymatic precursor, GAD, in both sleep and wake-related hy- pothalamic regions, and opposite changes in expression of mRNA for GABARs, when measured five days after the exposure period. Deficient hypothalamic GABAergic mechanisms may contribute to motor hyperactivity and disrupted sleep in victims of perinatal AE.

N2  - Introduction: Experimental research suggests that certain effects of prenatal alcohol, notably viability, prenatal growth and neuro-motor functions, can be prevented by a concomitant exposure to antioxidants, including omega-3 fatty acids. This supplementation would protect against the oxidative stress and the fluctuations in fatty acid concentrations observed in animals and infants exposed to alcohol during gestation, this hypothesis is of particular interest for Inuit communities where prenatai alcohol consumption is prevalent and the consumption of traditional foods rich in omega-3 fatly acids is declining, To our knowledge, this hypothesis has never been tested in humans. The aim of this study was to assess the role of prenatal omega-3 fatty acid status in the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and development using an epidemiological approach. Methods: Data was collected among Inuit mothers and infants from Nunavik. Quebec. Maternal interviews were conducted during mid-pregnancy and I months postpartum to document prenatal alcohol use and potential confounding variables. Maternal blood was collected in the month following parturition for 112 women. Fatty acid concentrations of plasma phospholipids were expressed as percentages of the total area of all fatty acid peaks from cl4:0 to c24:l (percent weight). Prenatal growth was assessed at delivery, Infants were tested On visual acuity at 6 months. ANCOVAs were performed controlling for potential confounding variables and including the three independent variables: 1) DHA/AA ratio in maternal plasma phospholipids 2) Exposure to binge consumption patterns (> 5 alcoholic beverages per drinking episode) at least once during gestation 3) and the interaction term DHA/AA* binge exposure. Results: The interaction term was significantly associated with visual acuity at 6 months (F = 4.05 p = 0.047) and showed a tendency towards a significant association with birth weight (F = 3.71 p = 0.057). Discussion: The nature of the interactions and the implications of these findings, both for the people of Nunavik and for the general population, will be discussed.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinical manifestations of FASD are highly variable and include physical, mental and growth retardation, and multiple organ defects. The complex and diverse response of fetal cells to ethanol has prompted us to use a bioinformatics approach to study the effect of ethanol on fetal stem cells derived from the amniotic fluid (AFSCs). Large-scale transcriptome analysis of ethanol-treated AFSC showed pathways involved in skeletal development and ossification were up-regulated, suggesting a basis for ethanol-induced skeletal malformations in vivo. We therefore examined ethanol's effect on osteogenic differentiation of AFSC. Ethanol treatment during the first 48 hours of osteogenic differentiation increased calcium deposition, and increased both gene and protein expression of alkaline phosphatase. In contrast, ethanol treatment at a midpoint of differentiation (day 8) had no significant effect on the protein expression of alkaline phosphatase. These results suggest that transient exposure of AFSC to ethanol during early differentiation has long-term effects and enhances osteogenic diffferentiation as indicated by an increase in bone-specific markers and calcium deposition.

N2  - Children exposed prenatally to alcohol may present with a broad range of problems, referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Neurodevelopmental deficits in these children include both primary problems related to central nervous system alterations, and secondary problems including an increased prevalence of depression and addiction. Alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) function are related to depression and addiction, and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters HPA function. Using our model of PAE, key brain regions were investigated in males and females following exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS) in adulthood. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley females were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: 1) Alcohol (ethanol, E)-liquid diet containing 36% ethanolderived calories; 2) Pair-fed (PF)-isocaloric liquid diet with maltose-dextrin substituted for ethanol, g/kg body wt/day of gestation; and 3) Control (C)-lab chow ad libitum. In adulthood, male and female offspring were either left undisturbed or were subjected to a 10 day CMS regimen. All animals were sacrificed on day 11 under basal conditions, and brains were analyzed for mRNA levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Preliminary evidence suggests that CRH mRNA levels did not differ among prenatal groups within the PVN, but were altered in the basolateral amygdala of E male and female rats. Interestingly, sex differences in CRH mRNA levels in response to stress were observed in E animals. In summary, region- and sexspecific alterations in CRH mRNA following CMS were observed, with differential effects among prenatal treatment groups.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure produces developmental abnormalities, including delayed maturation in humans. Similary, rats prenatally exposed to alcohol (PAE) show abnormal reproductive function, potentially driven by altered hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis regulation. Females show delayed puberty onset, reduced preovulatory-like lutenizing hormone (LH) surges, and early acyclicity onset. Similarly, males display reduced perinatal testosterone surges. The mechanism(s) underlying these perturbations has not been identified. Research indicates that an upregulation of Kiss-1 transcription in the hypothalamus occurs just prior to the onset of puberty. Altered expression of kisspeptins, products of the Kiss-1 gene that are essential regulators in the onset of puberty, is one potential mechanism. We tested the hypothesis that PAE-induced dysregualtion of kisspeptin/HPG function prior to the onset of puberty mediates delayed maturation via a downregulation of Kiss-1 mRNA, markedly altering hormonal markers of puberty as well. Offspring from PAE, pair-fed (PF) (nutritional control), and ad lib-fed control (C) dams were assessed at different developmental time points. We found that PAE and PF females have delayed vaginal opening, and inhibited age-related increases in estradiol, progesterone, and uterus/body weight ratio. In contrast, PAE did not affect testosterone levels, or testis weight in males. Interestingly, age-related increases in testosterone levels were inhibited in PF males only. The data suggest sex-specific effects of PAE, with delayed onset of puberty in PAE and PF females. Brains are currently being analyzed to determine if effects of both prenatal alcohol exposure and undernutrition on kisspeptin levels are responsible, at least in part, for the observed effects.

N2  - Nearly half of U.S. pregnancies are "unplanned". Although many women significantly reduce their alcohol use once they know they are pregnant, a large number of women do not realize they are pregnant until they are well into the first trimester. Because the early weeks of pregnancy are considered a critical period of fetal susceptibility to the actions of alcohol, alcohol-related birth defects may become established before a woman is aware she is pregnant. Therefore, to avoid an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP), it is critical to intervene with women prior to conception to help them reduce risky drinking and/or improve contraception. The CDC funded a comprehensive program of research to develop and test a preconception intervention to address risky alcohol use and ineffective contraception in an effort to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Project CHOICES was developed through a series of CDC funded initiatives. Project CHOICES Epidemiology Study (n=2,672): This first study was funded to identify settings with high prevalence of women at risk of AEP (Project CHOICES Research Group, 2002). Six settings were identified including: primary care, university-hospital based OB/GYN practices, an urban jail, substance abuse treatment programs, and a media-recruited sample. Respondents were 6.9 times more likely to be at risk for AEP (12.5%; 95% CI 5.2-9.3) than in the general population (2%). The prevalence of women at risk ranged from 5% in the primary care health centers to 24% in the substance abuse treatment programs. Project CHOICES Feasibility Study (n=190): Having identified settings with high numbers of women at risk, CDC next funded the CHOICES investigators to develop and test the feasibility and impact of an intervention to prevent AEP in a single arm study (Project CHOICES Intervention Research Group, 2003). The CHOICES intervention consisted of four motivational interviewing-based sessions and an OB/GYN visit. At six months postintervention, 68.2% of the women were at reduced risk of AEP. Project CHOICES Randomized Clinical Trial (n=830): Given the success of the feasibility study, the CHOICES investigators were next funded to test the intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT; Floyd, et al., 2007). In the RCT, 69.1% of the women in the CHOICES intervention reduced risk for an AEP at 9-months and the odds of being at reduced risk for AEP were twofold greater (OR 2.11) in the intervention group than the control group (95% CI 1.47-3.03). CHOICES+: The investigators from the Texas site have recently been funded to conduct the next phase of the Project CHOICES comprehensive prevention program. In CHOICES+, the original Project CHOICES intervention will be adapted to a 2-session intervention and modified to include a smoking intervention and referral to an evidence-based smoking cessation program within the Harris County Hospital District, one of the largest public hospital systems in the US. 74% of the women at risk of AEP in the CHOICES Efficacy Trial were current smokers. Smoking is also a potentially modifiable risk factor that frequently co-occurs with alcohol use and increases the risk of maternal and fetal complications. If successful, CHOICES+ could be disseminated throughout hospitals across the country.

N2  - Although fetal alcohol exposure has been associated with deficits in processing speed, relatively little is known about the neurophysiological response patterns that underlie cognitive performance. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in a large sample of Inuit children (M age = 11.3 yr; range = 9.8-12.9 yr) during a visual Go/No-Go task. The task required a button response press to each individually presented letter except the letter "X," which occurred on 30% of the trials. Stimuli were presented on a computer screen for 500 ms, with an offset of 1100 ms and ~200 ms interstimulus interval. Children were classified as either alcohol-exposed (ALC; n = 31) or controls (n = 76), depending on whether the mother reported any binge drinking during pregnancy when interviewed at the time of the ERP assessment. Both groups were more accurate in executing Go responses than in inhibiting No-go, M = 92 vs. 64%, F(1,105) = 522.1, p <.001. Failures to inhibit to No-go occurred more rapidly than correct Go presses, M = 395 vs. 465 ms, F(1,105) = 173.4, p <.001, suggesting that the pace of the task led to some impulsive errors. There were no differences between groups in accuracy or reaction time (ps >.20). ERP analyses focused primarily on Cz over the central scalp region, which revealed a slower P2 latency in ALC vs. controls, M = 269 vs. 252 ms, F(1,105) = 6.2, p <.05. As expected, P3 peak amplitude was larger to No-go vs. Go in all children, M = 14.8 vs. 6.7 muV, F(1,105) = 107.3, p <.001, but the No-go P3 was significantly reduced in the ALC group when compared with controls, M = 12.9 vs. 16.6 muV, F(1,105) = 5.1, p <.05. The finding of a delayed P2 component is consistent with recent findings on a similar visual Go/No-go task in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, suggesting a deficit in stimulus perception and identification processing that is evident at relatively low thresholds of exposure. In the context of the Go/No-go paradigm, the reduced P3 in the alcohol-exposed group may reflect less synchronous neuronal firing or reduced attentional allocation associated with response inhibition. These ERP effects, which were unaltered after accounting for a comprehensive set of potential confounders, indicate high specificity for alcohol. The absence of performance differences on this relatively challenging task suggests that the children with prenatal alcohol exposure may be achieving successful response inhibition through different neural pathways.

N2  - Purpose: Reductions in hippocampal volume are commonly reported in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs); for example, previous work in our lab has shown loss of left hippocampal volume and disturbed age-related volumetric hippocampal growth relative to typically developing controls (Willoughby et al., JINS, 2008). Given the memory impairments in FASDs and hippocampal vulnerability to prenatal alcohol exposure hippocampal abnormalities may be expected, although some authors have reported no volume differences relative to typically developing controls. However, volumetry measures may not reveal the full scope of prenatal alcohol damage and more subtle hippocampal deficits may exist. Thus, the purpose of this research is to extend study of the hippocampus in FASDs beyond volume measures to other indices of hippocampal shape and composition. We hypothesized that the hippocampi in children with a FASD would show (1) reduced linear width, (2) disturbed microstructural diffusion characteristics, and (3) an abnormal metabolic profile. Methods: 24 children with a FASD and 21 controls, aged 10-14 underwent scanning in a 1.5T GE scanner. Structural, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data were collected. For both the left and right hippocampus two raters masked to group status (1) manually traced volume and width, (2) yielded ROI-based measures of mean diffusivity, axial and radial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy, and (3) measured absolute metabolic concentrations. Results: In FASD relative to controls left hippocampal parameters showed an overall thinning and significantly reduced width in the posterior region (p <.05). Mean, axial, and radial diffusivity were reduced in the medial temporal lobe and multiple metabolic differences were observed, with decreases in inositol, Nacetyl-aspartate, and glutamine-glutamate (all ps <.05). There were fewer differences between typically developing children and children with a FASD on right hippocampal parameters, although middle hippocampal width and creatine were reduced suggesting damage occurred (ps<.05). Conclusions: These findings reveal an array of hippocampal abnormalities in children with a FASD. The left hippocampus in particular showed posterior thinning, decreased diffusivity, and aberrant metabolic profiles.

N2  - Gestational alcohol exposure is associated with structural and functional brain alterations, neuropsychological deficits, and increased risk of developing mental illness, including substance use disorders. Cognitive vulnerabilities have been proposed as one potential mechanism contributing to addiction risk, but little research has compared the cognitive abilities of youth with FASD to other populations at risk for problematic substance use. This study compared neuropsychological performance of youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to peers with conduct disorder and/or a familial history of alcoholism, but without prenatal alcohol exposure. Sixty-nine youth (mean age: 13.6 years) underwent neuropsychological assessment, across four demographically-matched groupings: youth with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (n = 17), youth with a high density of non-maternal familial alcoholism (n = 16), youth with conduct disorder (n = 18), and comparison youth without risk factors (n = 18). Neuropsychological outcomes included measures of working memory, planning, processing speed, and academic achievement. Caregivers also completed a behavior checklist. Between-group comparisons revealed that the FASD group showed poorer performance on the majority of neuropsychological outcomes examined and higher rates of behavior problems, compared to the three other groups, which did not differ from each other. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) of observed differences ranged from medium to large. These data show poorer neuropsychological performance and higher rates of caregiver reported behavior problems in adolescents with FASD, in comparison to youth with risk factors for developing substance use problems. Future studies will examine how cognitive impairments may relate to the development of problematic substance use in individuals with FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with behavioral and neurological problems including hyperactivity, attention deficits, and learning and memory functions. Whereas the firing rate of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) decreases in PAE offspring, DA level in nucleus accumbens (NAc) increases after alcohol challenge. We have observed an increase of DA as well as a decrease of serotonin (5-HT) in anticipation and as a consequence of alcohol-heightened aggressive behavior. Since many of the women drink alcohol during pregnancy, we examined the effect of PAE on extracellular levels of neurotransmitters including DA, NE and 5-HT during alcohol-heightened aggressive behavior in rats. Pregnant dams were exposed to 6g/kg of alcohol from gestational day (GD) 8 through GD20. An intubation (IC) and the ad libitum control (C) were used as control groups. After birth, brief maternal separation distress was assessed by the rate of ultrasonic vocalization at postnatal day (PN) 7-8. Play-fighting behavior was followed at PN 26-32, with each pair having been separated 24 h prior to the encounter. On PN60, rats were assessed for social interactions during a 5-min session. Each experimental male rat was then pair-housed with a female to increase the probability to engage in aggressive behavior toward an intruder. Each rat self-administered 1.0 g/kg of alcohol daily, and twice a week of 5-min intruder confrontation was conducted. Once the rats engaged in stable rates of aggressive behavior, they were implanted with a guide cannula unilaterally into the NAc core. Microdialysis probe was inserted thereafter and microdialysates were collected during aggressive confrontations. The levels of DA, NE and 5-HT were determined using HPLC with ECD system. No significant differences were observed with ultrasonic vocalization calls among the groups, while prenatal alcohol group tended to engage in more play fighting behavior relative to the IC and C groups during young adolescence. DA level after alcohol consumption increased in PAE group, compared to the control groups. No trends were observed after sucrose consumption. These results indicate that PAE may affect social behaviors in offspring especially in alcohol-heightened aggressive behavior, which could be due to the neuronal adaptation during development.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) disorders. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, and are unique in their capacity for continuous self-renewal and pluripotential differentiation. When cultured in suspension, without antidifferentiation factors, mouse ES cells differentiate to three-dimensional multicellular aggregates, called embryoid bodies (EBs). A set of transcription factors (Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog) is responsible for maintaining the ES cell state in both humans and mice through activation/repression of target genes. Downregulation of these transcription factors has been shown to occur during cell differentiation. We used the spontaneous, untargeted differentiation of mouse ES cells to EBs as an in vitro model to investigate the effect of ethanol during early embryogenesis. Our previous study using Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates has indicated that ethanol exposure of mouse ES cells during differentiation to EBs interfered with the expression levels of Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog. Here, we used multicolor flow cytometry (FC) for pluripotency marker analysis, simultaneously with measurement of cell viability and apoptosis markers (7-AAD staining and anti-cleaved PARP antibody) to distinguish protein expression levels in live vs. apoptotic/dead cells. Data showed that during differentiation of mES cells to EBs in live cells i) both Sox2 and Nanog protein expression were downregulated, and ii) treatment of ES cells with ethanol for three days accelerated downregulation of Sox2 and Nanog expression. Furthermore, iii) ethanol induced more than two-fold increase in apoptosis during differentiation of ES cells to EBs, as assessed by FC with annexin-V/7-AAD staining. Our findings suggest that ethanol triggers apoptosis and deregulates the pluripotency regulatory network of core transcription factors during early embryogenesis, which may be responsible for abnormalities observed in FAS. This study lays the foundation for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating the differentiated EB state in response to ethanol.

N2  - Chronic prenatal ethanol exposure (CPEE) is associated with long-lasting alterations in synaptic function in the hippocampus and persistent deficits in learning and memory in postnatal offspring. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of moderate prenatal ethanol exposure on synaptic function in early postnatal life, a critical period during which alterations in synaptic activity could have long-term consequences for the structure and plasticity of developing brain circuitry. Two groups of timed pregnant guinea pigs consumed ad libitum either water or 1% (w/v) aqueous ethanol solution beginning at gestational day (GD) 20. The concentration of the aqueous ethanol solution was increased in increments of 0.5% every two days until a final concentration of 5% (w/v) ethanol was achieved. Hippocampal brain slices (350 mum) were prepared from postnatal offspring of the two experimental groups at postnatal days (PD) 0-1, 7-9, 14-16, or 21-23. Extracellular recording of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) were obtained in the CA1 stratum radium of the hippocampus. Paired-pulse facilitation (30 ms interstimulus interval), long-term potentiation (LTP, 1 Hz for 2 s at 75% stimulus intensity), and input-output curves were measured. At PD 0-1, CPEE offspring exhibited decreased body weight compared to control offspring. There was no difference in fEPSP input-output curves between CPEE and control offspring at any of the ages tested. Paired-pulse facilitation, indicative of short-term synaptic plasticity, tended to be lower (p = 06256) in CPEE offspring at PD 7-9. LTP was enhanced in CPEE offspring at PD 0-1 (p < 0.05), but not at any other postnatal age studied. Hippocampal slices from CPEE or control offspring did not exhibit seizure activity or hyperexcitability following tetanic stimulation. These data indicate that moderate CPEE, via maternal volitional ethanol consumption, alters synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus selectively in the neonate, which may have long term neurobehavioural consequences manifesting in later postnatal life.

N2  - Cardinal features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) include varying degrees of central nervous system dysfunction and growth retardation. We previously reported that with each bout of maternal alcohol consumption (1.75 g/kg), the mother and fetus exhibit transient acidemia and reductions in maternal and fetal plasma amino acid levels, the availability of which are critical to fetal growth and development. This study tested the hypothesis that supplementation with glutamine, an amino acid that is important in the regulation of acid base homeostasis, would lessen or eliminate the reduction in fetal plasma amino acid levels in response to alcohol (thus potentially having a protective effect). Pregnant ewes at 130 +/- 7 days gestation were assigned to one of three treatment groups: a saline control group, an alcohol group, and an alcohol plus glutamine supplementation group. The alcohol (1.75 mg/kg) or saline infusions were delivered intravenously over an hour. L-Glutamine (30 mg/kg) was administered as a bolus intravenously at the beginning of the experiment. Changes in fetal arterial pH and amino acid levels (measured by HPLC) were measured over one hour (peak BAC occurs at one hour). The alcohol group displayed a significant reduction in plasma levels of multiple amino acids, including glutamine, arginine, citrulline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, histidine, alanine, phenylalanine, ornithine, glycine, and b-alanine at the 60th minute compared to the baseline values. In contrast, the saline control group exhibited no differences and there were mild elevations or no changes in the alcohol plus glutamine group. Thus, we conclude that the fetal growth retardation caused by alcohol induced alterations in fetal amino acids levels may be ameliorated by glutamine supplementation. Supported by NIAAA 10940 (TAC).

N2  - Previous work demonstrated that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) results in brain defects at different stages of development. The current studies were undertaken to characterize the effects of PAE on the levels of several neurotransmitters at early developmental stages. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed at embryonic day 7 (E7) with either a 25% ethanol derived calorie (ALC) or pair-fed (PF) liquid diet. At E13, fetal brains were collected from dams of both the ALC and PF groups. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to evaluate the levels of neurotransmitters in E13 fetal brains. This approach employed here involves the use of a chiral LC column in conjunction with quantitative mass spectrometric multiple reaction monitoring attained utilizing a triple quadrupole MS. Quantitative chiral analyses of catecholamines, idolamine and amino acids neurotransmitters revealed the reduction in the levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin and glutamate as a result of PAE (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the levels of glutamate in fetal brains at E13 between the ALC and PF groups. These findings demonstrate that PAE reduces the levels of catecholamines, idolamine and amino acids neurotransmitters in E13 fetal brains. This study suggests that alterations of selective neurotransmitters may be the cause of abnormalities in brain functions and behaviors in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

N2  - A cardinal feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is growth deficiency and all models of intrauterine growth restriction demonstrate reductions in uterine blood flow. Pregnancy-induced increases in uterine blood flow (~30 fold) is associated with increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, eNOS phosphorylation, and nitric oxide production at the level of maternal uterine artery endothelial cells (UAECs). We hypothesized that ethanol will reduce eNOS expression and its activity via reduced phosphorylation and the signaling pathways that control eNOS activity in UAECs. Endothelial cells from primary uterine arteries of pregnant ewes (gestational day 120-130; term = 147) were isolated and validated using FACS and maintained in culture to passage 4. Maternal binge drinking patterns were mimicked; i.e. UAECs cultured to 70% confluence were treated with 0 (control), 60, 90, 120, or 150 mg/dl of ethanol in a compensating system for 5 h on 2 consecutive days. Cell lysates were analyzed using Western blotting. Cell viability was maintained among groups; uncleaved caspase 3 was unaltered by ethanol and cleaved caspase 3 was not detectable. Compared to control, total eNOS level was reduced to 70%, 70%, 63%, and 43% at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl ethanol respectively. p635eNOS also decreased substantially to 29%, 21%, 18%, and 15% with increasing ethanol concentrations. Caveolin-1, the caveolar scaffolding protein that is predominantly associated with eNOS was unaltered by ethanol treatment. However, investigation of the ERK1/2 pathway, the major signaling cascade that is coupled to eNOS activation in UAECs revealed that total ERK1 was reduced to 87%, 75%, 55%, and 16% and total ERK2 was reduced to 66%, 55%, 35%, and 21% respectively at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl ethanol. In addition, compared to the control, pERK1 level was reduced to 57%, 32%, 29%, and 24% with increasing ethanol doses. These alterations were specific to ERK1/2 signaling in that pAKT or total AKT were not altered among groups. These data delineate the effects of binge-like ethanol exposure on the abundance and post-translational modification via phosphorylation of eNOS and ERK1/2 enzymes in UAECs. Further, stoichiometrically disproportional levels of eNOS and caveolin-1 may influence eNOS phosphorylation. These results strongly hint that intrauterine environment may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of FASD. Support: NIH HL49210, HD38843 HL89144, AA10940.

N2  - There is increasing evidence that alcohol exposure during the developmental period can leave lasting epigenetic marks consequently perturbing the expression of key genes resulting in physiological and behavioral changes in the offspring of the exposed individual. For example, the expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene in the hypothalamic nuclei of rats exposed to alcohol in utero is significantly diminished as compared to control animals. Long lasting changes in the gene expression of various genes are often caused by alteration in the DNA methylation pattern in the promoter region of the affected gene. In this study we investigated the effect of the prenatal alcohol exposure on the DNA methylation in the hypothalamic POMC promoter by methylation-specific PCR. The rat POMC gene contains a CpG island spanning almost 200 bps in the -59 to -244 region. Nine sets of primers specific for various CpG-rich sites from this region were designed to assess the extent of cytosine methylation in the male offspring of alcohol-fed (AF) mother compared to the pair-fed (PF) and ad libitum-fed (AD) groups. We identified several sites where the cytosine methylation in the AF animals was significantly higher than in the control groups. In particular, in the site spanning the region -81 to -146 the ratio of methylated to unmethylated signals was 6 to 10 times higher in AF animals in comparison to controls. Thus, the POMC promoter hypermethylation in the hypothalami of the AF rats may be a causative factor in the decrease of neuronal POMC gene expression in the affected animals.

N2  - Background: We previously identified a metric of "at-risk" drinking during pregnancy in an urban African-American cohort. The metric included multiple indicators of alcohol consumption and of problem drinking. The metric was validated by demonstrating that it had greater utility than individual measures of alcohol consumption in predicting several neurobehavioral outcomes in preschool children. We hypothesized that our metric of "at-risk" drinking would also improve prediction of birth outcomes. Methods: A measure of "at-risk" prenatal alcohol exposure was constructed using antenatal maternal report of average alcohol per day (AAD) and per drinking day (AADD) at around conception, at the first prenatal visit, and across pregnancy. Scores on the MAST, T-ACE and CAGE screens were also included in computing the "at-risk" metric. Birth size data were used for 224 children from the same cohort and who did not participate in the previous preschool assessment. Ballard maturational score and measures of birth weight, birth length, and head circumference were examined. Data were analyzed using partial correlations between birth data and the "at-risk" metric and the several component measures of prenatal alcohol consumption, controlling for gestational age based on date of last menstrual period. Results: Smaller birth size, including birth-weight and a trend for birth-height, and lower Ballard maturational scores at birth were predicted solely by the metric of "at-risk" alcohol consumption. Conclusion: The current metric of maternal gestational alcohol consumption predicted alcohol-related decreases in birth weight and birth length and gestation age at birth. The results further validated the metric as a more reliable assessment of fetal risk prenatal alcohol exposure than any of the component frequency/quantity measures. Previous research has demonstrated a significant potential for considerable maternal under-reporting and denial of in-pregnancy alcohol consumption. The current or similar metrics may limit under-reporting and be more accurate assessments of exposure, critical to diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) and to research examining neurobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine important predictors of periconceptional risky drinking among pregnant Latinas in New Mexico. Binge drinking patterns during pregnancy, especially in early pregnancy, might lead to development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in the offspring. Pregnant women attending the University of New Mexico prenatal care clinics served as the study population. Consecutively chosen patients who gave consent were recruited into the study. For purposes of this analysis, the sample size was restricted to 155 Latina women. Women were interviewed by a bilingual trained interviewer about any episodes of binge drinking (> 4 drinks/occasion) a month around their last menstrual period (LMP) and were administered a TWEAK screening questionnaire. Socio-demographic (age, education, insurance, place of birth, marital status), lifestyle (smoking), and reproductive health (gravidity, parity, pregnancy planning, history of adverse perinatal outcomes) characteristics were ascertained. The expected date of delivery and gestational age were based on LMP and fetal ultrasound. Predictors of binge drinking were identified by Chi-square tests and logistic regression in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. A backward selection procedure was used to identify those covariates that were independently associated with binge drinking in the final multivariable model. In this sample, 17.4% of Latinas admitted at least one binge drinking episode a month around their LMP. Results of multivariate analysis indicate that Latinas born in the U.S. have much greater risk of binge drinking in periconceptional period (OR=3.2; 95% CI: 1.2; 8.9) compared to foreign-born Latinas. Similarly, Latinas who primarily speak English at home were at much greater risk (OR=3.6; 95% CI: 1.3; 10.5) compared with predominately Spanish-speaking women. No other variables were identified as significant predictors in multivariable models. Even though Latinas are often considered to be at lower risk of alcohol abuse, recent reports indicate that the pre valence of alcohol consumption in this group might be increasing due to changing cultural norms. Our results indicate that higher-acculturated Latinas are at much greater risk of binge drinking before conception and in early pregnancy compared with less-acculturated Latinas. Culturally sensitive interventions should be developed to address risky alcohol consumption among Latinas of reproductive age.

N2  - Purpose: Cigarette smoking and alcohol are alarming behaviors among women at risk for unexpected pregnancy. If such women are engaging in risky drinking and cigarette smoking, they may not know they are pregnant for at least 6 weeks and could do potential harm to a fetus during some of its most vulnerable stages (Lundsberg et al. 1997; Shaw and Lammer, 1999; Sood et al. 2001). This study will examine the relationship between cigarette smoking, drinking, and sexual behaviors found among women participating in Project EARLY. Methods: This study is an analysis of data gathered from the baseline assessment of an ongoing randomized control trial testing a 1-session motivational interviewing counseling intervention aimed at reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) risk. Therapists gathered data concerning patterns of smoking, drinking, and sexual activity in the form of self-reported questionnaires and a 90-day timeline follow back method. To determine the relationship between the variables of interest two-tailed Pearson correlations were calculated and Bonferroni adjustments were made to control for inflated alpha. Results: Cigarette smoking and number of male partners reported in past 90 days were unrelated to each other; however, positive correlations were found between the number of male partners and drinking behaviors (total drinks, r=.218, p=.006; binges, r=.264, p=.001; drinks per week, r=.214, p=.007). Number of smoking days out of 30 and number of cigarettes smoked per smoking day were significantly associated with a younger age at first reported sexual intercourse (r=-.218, p=.006; r=-.232, p=.005) respectively. Cigarette smoking was also significantly associated with risky drinking patterns. Number of smoking days out of 30 was correlated with number of binges (r=.220, p=.006) and number of drinks per week (r=.212, p=.008). Number of cigarettes smoked per smoking day was correlated with number of binges (r=.224, p=.007). Conclusions: These findings suggest a relationship among cigarette smoking, risky drinking, and risky sexual behaviors. Among women at risk for an AEP, it may be beneficial to include interventions targeting smoking behaviors in addition to risky drinking, as both can lead to harmful effects for a fetus.

N2  - Possible prevention of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure has been investigated using peptides that were previously shown to be involved in neuroprotection both in vitro and in vivo. We focused in this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects of two derived peptides with regards to the determination of the signaling pathways involved in neuroprotection. One peptide with the sequence NAPV-SIPQ, known as NAP, a fragment of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, and the other demonstrated a potent protective effect against oxidative stress associated with alcohol exposure. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned the following groups: (1) Ethanol liquid diet group (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v) ethanol derived calories, (2) Pair-fed (PF) control group (3) Chow control group, (4) treatment groups with alcohol alongside i.p. injections of D-NAP (ALC/D-NAP, 20 or 30 mug/20 g body weight), (5) PF/D-NAP control group. On E13, fetal brains were collected and assayed for TUNEL-staining, caspase-3 colorimetric assay and ELISA for cytochrome c and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) detection. Our results show that NAP significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of the fetal brain. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP administration significantly prevented alcohol-induced increases in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium cingulate cortex and basal ganglia eminence. The investigation of downstream signaling pathways involving NAP neuroprotection revealed that this peptide significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in the concentrations of caspase-3 in E13 fetal brains. Moreover, ELISA for cytochrome c shows that NAP significantly prevented both alcohol-induced increases in the level of cytosolic cytochrome c and alcohol-induced decreases in the level of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Importantly, analysis of proteins in the upstream signaling pathway revealed that NAP down-regulated the phosphorylation of JNK These data provide an understanding of NAP intracellular target, and the signaling mechanisms of action that will pave a path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during prenatal stages.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts behavioral development, leading to long-lasting alterations in a number of domains, including cognitive performance. Using a rodent model, we have previously shown that choline supplementation can attenuate adverse effects of developmental alcohol exposure, even when administered weeks later, during postnatal development. The present study examined whether administration of choline at different postnatal ages following ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent neonatal brain growth spurt, can reduce alcohol-related memory impairments. Neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of seven treatment groups. Five groups received ethanol intubations in a binge-like manner from postnatal day (PD) 4-9 at a dose of 5.25 g/kg/day; two groups served as sham intubated controls. All rats were injected s.c. from PD 11-40 with either 100 mg/kg/day choline chloride or saline. One ethanol-exposed group was injected with saline from PD 11-40; the others received choline injections from PD 11-20, PD 21-30, PD 31-40, or PD 11-40. The two sham groups received either choline or saline throughout the PD 11-40 period. At three months of age, subjects were tested on an object recognition task, a simple and sensitive task used to assess long-term memory. On day 1 of the task, all rats spent a substantially higher amount of time exploring an unfamiliar square wood bead than familiar circular wood beads. On day 2, a significant preference for a second novel object, a wooden spindle over the square was observed in all groups, except the ethanol-exposed group not treated with choline. That is, administration of choline supplementation at any of the time points significantly improved object recognition performance among alcohol-exposed, with the greatest improvement among those that received choline from PD 11-40. These findings suggest that choline administration at various postnatal periods can attenuate ethanol's effects on simple memory performance. These results have important implications for the intervention of alcohol's adverse effects on development, indicating that choline may serve as an effective treatment for individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, even when administered later in postnatal life.

N2  - We have recently demonstrated that prenatal exposure to ethanol causes a significant decrease in the number of beta-endorphin (BEP) neurons in the hypothalamus in rats. Although ethanol is known to induce BEP neuronal apoptotic death, it is not known whether it also alters differentiation of BEP neurons from neuronal progenitor cells. Using an early postnatal binge ethanol administration model and bromdeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling method, we show here that ethanol reduced the number of differentiated BEP neurons. Similarly, moderate dose of ethanol inhibited the differentiation and maturation of BEP neurons by cAMP-activating agents in primary cultures of fetal hypothalamic neuronal progenitor cells. Since the cAMP-activating agent increased BEP neuron differentiation in vitro, we tested the effect of nanosphere-delivered cAMP into the 3rd ventricle on endogenous progenitor cell differentiation to BEP neurons in adult male rats. We found, nanosphere-delivered cAMP significantly increased the number of BEP neurons in these rats. Functional studies using NK cell response to lipopolysaccaride in the nanosphere-treated rats verified the histological data of BEP neuronal growth. These data suggest that prenatal ethanol exposure alters progenitor cell differentiation to reduce the number of BEP cells. Furthermore, the data provide first evidence to show the potential of nanosphere's delivered cAMP to generate new BEP neurons to reduce immune and stress problems in fetal alcohol exposed subjects.

N2  - Prevention of alcohol use is difficult, thus therapies that ameliorate alcohol's damage are desirable. The severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) increases with parity, implying the depletion of a protective maternal factor. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in women and causes neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring that parallel FASD. We hypothesized that moderate maternal iron inadequacy (ID) exacerbates alcohol's effects upon the developing brain and tested this in rat pups reared by dams fed iron-sufficient (IS) or ID diets. We exposed pups to 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg alcohol during the brain growth spurt period via gastric gavage (postnatal days 4-9; P4-9). Blood alcohol levels were not altered by iron status and peaks were ~275 or ~420 mg/dl for the 3.5 and 5 g/kg alcohol doses, respectively. Dams of the ID pups had depleted iron stores without anemia, a condition common in American women. At P10, ID pups fed 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg alcohol (ID-0, ID-3.5, ID-5) were smaller and anemic as indicated by decreased hemoglobin. At ~P32 we evaluated the pups' associative learning skills using delay eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC), a cerebellum-dependent task. The frequency and amplitude of conditioned responses (CR) in the ID-0, IS-0, IS-3.5, and IS-5 groups did not differ reflecting the test's simplicity. In contrast, ID-5 pups had a dramatically reduced CR frequency and strength; values were ~63% and 38%, respectively, of control values. ID-3.5 pups had a non-significant trend toward impaired learning. A main effect for alcohol dose and significant iron status x alcohol dose interaction were seen for CR frequency, F[2, 47]=6.44, p < 0.005, and CR amplitude, F[2, 47]=3.23, p < 0.05. Proliferative and apoptotic responses in the P10 cerebellar cortex were evaluated with cleaved caspase-3 and phosphohistone H3 immunostaining. Preliminary results indicate that ID-5 pups have increased cerebellar proliferation and apoptosis when compared to IS-5 pups. Additional behavioral assessments, including trace ECC, are underway to evaluate the extent of the neurodevelopmental damage caused by alcohol and developmental ID. This is the first study to show that maternal iron inadequacy profoundly exacerbates alcohol's effects upon learning in the offspring. We propose that maternal iron status is an important modulator of fetal neurobehavioral outcome following alcohol exposure. (Funded by NIH award T32 ES07015, R32 AA11085 and Palmer fund).

N2  - Introduction: Identifying neurochemical effects specific to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can help define neurobehavioral profiles in the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs). In vivo phosphorus (31P) MR spectroscopy profiles neurochemical development after PAE by measuring components of metabolic pathways of membrane phospholipids (MPLs), including precursors (e.g., phosphoethanolamine [PE] and phosphocholine [PC]) and breakdown products (e.g., glycerophosphoethanolamine [GPE] and and glycerophosphocholine [GPC]). MPL precursor levels are sensitive to early neurodevelopmental changes in cortex. We hypothesized that PAE would alter MPL metabolism, reflecting frontocortical developmental delay. Methods: Participants were 20 African American children - 11 PAE (6 boys, 6.0-7.6 yrs old) and 9 non-PAE (3 boys, 6.0-8.0 yrs old) - from a larger study of interactionsof gestational nutrition and prenatal alcohol. A 3-D whole-brain, multi-voxel 31P spectroscopy measure was done at 4 Tesla. Cortical regions of interest included dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC), orbitofrontal (OFC), ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC), anterior cingulate (ACC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Group differences in levels of PE, PC, GPE, and GPC were tested using the generalized estimating equation method with group, gender, and side (right vs. left) as factors. Results: PE levels were significantly higher bilaterally in the ACC, IFG and vmPFC of PAE children compared to non-PAE children. GPE levels were significantly higher in DLPFC and GPC levels were higher in the OFC in PAE children compared to non-PAE children. Conclusion: In healthy development, PE levels are higher at birth then decrease with age, reflecting high early MPL synthesis critical for neocortical development. In contrast, levels of MPL breakdown products (GPE and GPC) are low early in life and later increase, reflecting greater MPL turnover in older children. The current preliminary results showing higher PE levels and greater breakdown activity of MPLs in several prefrontal areas suggest a possible PAE-related delay in the maturation of cortical development. The implications of possible deviations in developmental trajectories of MPL metabolism and relations to neurobehavioral outcome remain to be determined.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have altered performance in learning and memory tasks and have altered physiological function, including hyperesponsiveness to stressors. In our rat model, parallel changes are observed. The hippocampus is a key modulator of stress, is involved in learning and memory, and is a site for adult neurogenesis. Previously, we found that PAE alters stressinduced suppression in neurogenesis in male rats. Here we investigated patterns of adult hippocampal neurogenesis under basal and stress conditions in PAE female rats. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley females were assigned to 1 of 3 prenatal treatments on day 1 of pregnancy: 1) Alcohol (ethanol, E) - liquid diet containing 36% ethanol-derived calories; 2) Pair-fed (PF) - isocaloric liquid diet with maltosedextrin substituted for ethanol, g/kg body wt/day of gestation; and 3) Control (C) - lab chow ad libitum. In adulthood, female offspring were assigned to either non-stress (undisturbed throughout) or stress (9 days of repeated restraint stress, 1 hr/day) conditions. On day 10, all rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine and perfused either 24hr (cell proliferation) or 3wk (cell survival) later. There was a stressinduced increase in cell proliferation in C (p=.058), but not E or PF females. While there was no effect of stress on cell survival in C and E females, PF females exhibited a stress-induced decrease, which may be due to elevated levels of cell survival under basal conditions (PF>C,E, p <.05). Cell survival was further assessed using NeuN (neuron specific marker) and GFAP (glial cell marker). E females produced fewer new neurons than C and PF females under both basal and stress conditions (p < 05). Intriguingly, E females also had reduced glial cells compared to C and PF animals under both basal and stress conditions (p <.05). These results indicate that alterations in adult neurogenesis occur under both basal and stress conditions in E females. PAE appears to alter the neurogenic stress response differentially in males and females, suggesting a mediating role for the gonadal hormones. It is possible that alterations in neurogenesis following PAE and stress may contribute to learning and memory deficits seen in individuals with FASD. Specific PF effects could be due to the stress/diet restriction that accompanies pair-feeding.

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to establish the clinical value of meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) analysis as a universal screening tool intended for the identification of infants at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). This will be accomplished by assessing the level of voluntary participation in a prenatal alcohol exposure screening program with informed consent, and by determining the logistics and feasibility of implementing meconium testing, the necessary follow-up, and intervention programs, as part of routine care. In addition, this study will determine whether FAEE-positive meconium correlate with standard childhood developmental milestones and Bayley's test for neurodevelopmental screening. Methods: Over the course of 5 years, informed consent will be sought from all women from the region of Grey Bruce, Ontario delivering at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario. Meconium samples will be collected and tested for the presence of FAEE by solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Children who test positive for meconium FAEE will be matched to children who test negative and followed-up for 2 years through an existing Public Health program in the area involving frequent home visits and assessments of developmental milestones by a Public Health nurse. Matched controls will be followed-up by study personnel via regular phone interviews to assess developmental milestones. If a developmental delay is suspected, the child will undergo neurodevelopmental testing with a trained professional, and will be referred to various intervention programs in the area tailored to the child's needs. Furthermore, support services for the mother will be available if needed. This study has been approved by research ethics boards of the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Western Ontario. Results: Enrollment and sample collection has begun in November, 2008. The first positive case has been identified, and the planned follow-up set up with the Public Health department. Discussion: This study will reveal the population's willingness to partake in a neonatal screening program for prenatal ethanol exposure, assess its utility as a standard tool in clinical practice, and enable us to propose a model for service delivery. Furthermore, this study will determine the predictive value of FAEE-positive meconium with regards to neurodevelopment delays frequently observed in FASD-affected individuals.

N2  - Most children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy can not be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We are investigating whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene and protein expression at term may provide a reliable and sensitive diagnostic indicator of maternal drinking during pregnancy as well as a prognostic indicator of the risk of functional brain damage predictive of adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in affected offspring. We previously reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy alters the expression of about two dozen genes coding for proteins associated with nervous, endocrine and immune system development. In the current study, we initiated a combination of two-dimensional PAGE analyses coupled with mass spectroscopy to identify placental proteins altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were assigned to one of two experimental groups. One group consumed a 5% ethanol solution (in 0.066% saccharin water) four hours a day throughout gestation, resulting in a mean maternal peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. A control group consumed a matched volume of saccharin water four hours each day. At term (gestational day 20) placentas were harvested, saline-perfused to remove blood from the tissue, and processed for analysis of protein expression. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis revealed a large number of proteins whose expression is diminished by maternal drinking during pregnancy. To date, preliminary mass spectroscopic analysis of isolated spots has identified eighteen proteins altered by maternal drinking. These proteins are associated with processes in cell differentiation and development, morphogenesis of anatomical structures and regulation of apoptosis. The preliminary results suggest that a sufficiently large enough number of placental proteins are altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD.

To further understand the developmental consequences of alcohol exposure, this study was designed with two objectives: (1) Identify the effect of alcohol exposure on underlying cranial facial bone growth in a mouse model; and (2) Examine the relationship between bone and facial dysmorphology and compare mouse and human morphometries. Methods: Four treatments of C57BL/6J dams (The Jackson Laboratory), CHOW, ALC-PF (pre-pregnancy alcohol exposure and at-pregnancy isocaloric pair-fed), PF-PF (pre- and at-pregnancy pair-fed), and ALC-ALC (pre- and at-pregnancy alcohol exposure) were studied. The pre-pregnancy treatment lasted 7 days prior to mating and the pregnancy treatment between gestational day 7 (E7) and E16, using a 4.8% (v/v) alcohol exposure in a liquid diet. In-vivo three dimensional microCT imagings were performed at p7. Fifteen metric distances were measured on the skulls, which matched to the human studies by Moore et al. (2007). Stepwise discriminant analysis was performed examining the ability of anthropomorphic measures to classify alcohol exposed mice. Results: Measurements of width (minimal frontal and bigonial) correctly classified 90% of the ALC-ALC mice Vs 91 % of the CHOW mice. Results comparing ALC-ALC to ALC-PF used inner canthai and mid face differences and correctly classified 76% and 83% respectively. These results are similar to those based on microvedio facial analysis in mouse (see Anthony et al adjacent poster). Conclusion: These results are similar to those reported in human studies (Moore et al., 2007) in which width and depth measurements successfully classified FAS individuals from controls. This indicates a similar effect of alcohol exposure on dysmorphology across species. Further studies will help delineate effects of quantity and frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure on facial dysmorphology to enable diagnosis of FASD.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), including a wide spectrum of developmental deficits in face and brain. Presence of a set of abnormal facial features (including a smooth Philtrum, short Palpebral fissures, and thin Upper Vermillion) is required for diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, many children with prenatal alcohol exposure sufficient to induce facial deficits do not show cardinal features of facial dysmorphology and diagnosis is not feasible. This study aims to delineate the effect of alcohol on the spectrum of dysmorphic facial features, using mice, C57BL/B6J (B6J, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Ma), and C57BL/6N (B6N, Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN), with common ancestry, separated by > 150 generations. The alcohol treatment consists of 4.8% alcohol liquid diet for 7 days pre-pregnancy, and gestational days 7(E7)to E16. The diet volume, blood alcohol levels, and 14 anthropometric facial measurements for E17 embryos were analyzed. Measurements were used in discriminant analysis to obtain positive predictability of alcohol exposure. We found that B6N demonstrated higher alcohol intake and blood alcohol concentrations than B6J, and embryonic weights are reduced in both lines. Alcohol altered upper and mid facial depths; nasal, nasal bridge and palpebral fissure lengths; and outer canthal width in both B6N and B6J, with B6N having additional facial width changes. Discriminant analysis of facial measurements to classify alcohol exposure for Alc to Chow control demonstrated B6N and B6J required minimal frontal width, with B6N requiring added width features, apposed to B6J requiring width and depth features. (Predictability: B6N, 90%; B6J, 87%). Analysis of Alc to Pair-Fed groups suggested B6N required width classifications with mid facial depth, and B6J required facial depth and height (predictability: B6N, 92%; B6J, 85%). Our data indicates that B6N and B6J mice show dysmorphic facial features, comparable to human facial differences by ethnicity (Moore et al., 2007). Current data shows differences in the severity of facial dysmorphology in mice with common ancestry, possibly attributed to genetic drift.

N2  - Project CHOICES tested a four session, manual-guided intervention targeting risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) and found a small to moderate effect of the intervention on risk drinking and inadequate contraception and a moderate effect on AEP risk among 415 risk-drinking women drawn from 2 high risk samples in each of 3 cities (Project CHOICES Intervention Research Group, 2003). The current study is examining potential mechanisms of action including therapist and client behaviors and interpersonal interactions by coding audiotapes of CHOICES sessions. We developed a one pass rating system derived from the MITI, the MISC, interpersonal ratings, and working alliance measures, and included several novel measures pertinent to our hypotheses. Five raters were trained to reliably rate therapist behaviors. Rater training required approximately 80 hours supplemented by biweekly rater meetings and occasional cross-coding of tapes. Raters coded 256 sessions including 15% that were cross-rated. They achieved intra-class correlations of .51-.96 on all core measures including MITI behavior counts and globals, with most measures achieving over 75% agreement. Once trained, they rated tapes in time-and-a-half, yielding a rich dataset of intervention processes that are being compared to outcomes to yield process-outcome relationships. This one pass rating system is comprehensive and feasible to describe motivational and interpersonal behaviors of therapists and clients in this successful intervention.

N2  - Studies on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure have frequently focused on the CA1 region of the hippocampus; however, the present studies support a role for the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) in the damaging effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain functioning. Given that prenatal alcohol exposure has been associated with hippocampal-dependent learning deficits and decreased ability to elicit long term potentiation (LTP) in the DG in adult animals, and that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling cascade by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is required for various forms of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as LTP, we hypothesized that fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) adult animals have deficits in NMDA receptor-dependent ERK1/2 activation. We used immunoblotting and immunohistochemical techniques to detect NMDA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in acute hippocampal slices prepared from adult FAE mice. We present evidence linking prenatal alcohol exposure to deficits in NMDA receptor-dependent ERK1/2 activation, specifically in the DG of adult offspring. This deficit may account for the LTP deficit in the DG, as well as the life-long cognitive deficits, associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Purpose: Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine trends in current alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant and nonpregnant women of childbearing age between 2001 and 2005 and to examine the prevalence among sociodemographic subgroups based on age, race/ethnicity, education, employment status and marital status. Methods: Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collected from 2001 through 2005 among 14,139 pregnant and 324,668 nonpregnant women aged 18-44 were analyzed. Annual prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking (5 or more drinks on an occasion) in the past 30 days were calculated for pregnant and nonpregnant women. Statistical significance of the relationship between prevalence estimates and time was estimated using chi-square tests. Prevalence estimates among subgroups were also estimated and logistic regression was used to determine the association between alcohol use and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: The findings indicate that while no statistically significant change occurred between 2001 and 2005 among pregnant women, a slight decline occurred in the prevalence of any alcohol use (54.6% to 52.2%; p<.001) and binge drinking (12.3% to 11.5%; p<.001) among nonpregnant women of childbearing age. Among pregnant women, the estimated prevalence of any alcohol use was higher among women aged 35-44 years (17.7%) than women aged 18-24 years (8.6%), college educated women (14.4%) than women with a high school education or less (8.5%), employed women (13.6%) than unemployed women (8.2%), and unmarried women (13.3%) than married women (10.2%). Conclusion: The relatively stable prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking demonstrate that alcohol use among women of childbearing age continues to be a public health concern. The higher prevalence of alcohol use among some sociodemographic subgroups such as higher educated, employed, or unmarried women suggests the need for targeted public health prevention activities.

N2  - This paper describes the motivational patterns that relate to risky drinking and ineffective contraception, two behaviors that can result in Alcohol Exposed Pregnancies (AEP). As part of an intervention study aimed at reducing AEP 124 women were recruited and reported demographic characteristics, readiness to change, stages of change (SOC) and, drinking, contraception and sexual behavior history. For drinking, a significant positive correlation was found between the number of drinks consumed in 90 days and the Importance to reduce drinking (r=.23, p.=.008) also a significant negative correlation between number of drinks and Confidence to reduce drinking (r=-.39, p.=.000) was found. Significant differences were found in the total number of drinks consumed in 90 days between the 5 SOC [F=(4,118),3.12, p=.01]. Women in Preparation reported drinking a significantly higher number of drinks than women in other SOC. For contraception there were significant negative correlations between ineffective contraception and Importance (r=-.38, p.=.00), Confidence (r=-.20, p.=.02) and Readiness (r=-.43, p.=.00) to use contraception effectively. Significant differences in contraception ineffectiveness were found for women in different SOC [F= (4,115) 8.58, p=.000]. Women in Precontemplation reported significantly higher levels of contraception ineffectiveness compared to women in other SOC. Results show a clear relationship between higher alcohol consumption and higher levels of motivation to reduce drinking. In contrast, higher levels of ineffective contraception were related to lower levels of motivation to use contraception effectively. This suggests risky drinking may be better targeted with brief skills building interventions and ineffective contraception may require interventions that enhance problem awareness and motivation.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol results in a range of adverse cognitive-behavioral and morphological outcomes, collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Children with FASD consistently exhibit delayed motor development and deficits in sensory-motor skills, suggesting that the measurement of these skills could be a powerful tool for assessing brain dysfunction in this population. There is a significant overlap between the brain structures affected by the teratogenic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and those that are responsible for the performance of sensory-motor tasks. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the robot exoskeleton known as the Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movements (KINARM) could serve as an objective tool for assessing sensory-motor deficits in children with FASD. Male and female children (9 to 15 years of age) were required to complete two tasks that assess sensory-motor control. Task 1: Visually-guided reaching movements examined the ability of subjects to generate goal-directed motor movements with each limb. The data acquisition system extracted over 20 features of visual-guided reaching including reaction time, movement time, joint motion, torque and power, relative joint power, path length, and movement variability. Task 2: Limb matching task required that the subject perform a bilateral limb matching task without vision: the robot moved one limb to a spatial location and the subject was asked to match this limb geometry with the other limb in the absence of visual cues. The resultant errors (the error in matching the spatial position of one arm with the other arm) were measured. In comparison to controls, children with FASD showed slower reaction times with both hands. Movement time was significantly slower in children with FASD only with the right hand. Moreover, children with FASD exhibited greater distance and direction errors with the right, but not the left, hand. Similarly, children with FASD displayed greater error in matching the spatial position of the right, but not the left, hand. The results of this study suggest that the KINARM is a promising research and diagnostic tool that could be used to assess motor control deficits in children resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - We have completed the first year of a 3-year study evaluating the effects of a strength-based, motor skill development program for children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Our hypothesis is that improvements in the motor domain will extend to other domains, and specifically affect behaviour and adaptive functioning. Moreover, prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, and this may underlie some of the behavioural and adaptive problems in individuals with FASD. Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibit increased basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond infancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the motor skill program on the HPA system (as indicated by salivary cortisol levels) and to compare cortisol levels of children with FASD to that of control children. Ten children (age 7-13 y) participated in an 8-week after-school motor skill development program consisting of 2 x 1.5 hour sessions/week. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 5 of these children (with confirmed diagnosis, FASD group) and compared at 3 time points: before, immediately after, and 2 months after completion of the program. In addition, cortisol levels were compared at each time point to 15 control children (C group, no FASD, similar age and gender to FASD group) to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: wake-up, after school, and just before bedtime. Salivary cortisol levels showed significant (p's < 0.05) diurnal variation in all children. Cortisol levels were elevated at wake-up, compared with after school and bedtime (p's < 0.001), but were not different between after school and bedtime. Cortisol levels did not vary significantly over the time points (before, immediately and 2 months after the program) in the C or FASD groups, indicating that there was no effect of the motor skill program on cortisol levels. When the time points were combined, there was a trend (p=0.059) for cortisol levels to be higher at wake-up in children with FASD, compared with control children. These preliminary results indicate that cortisol levels may be elevated at wake-up in children with FASD, and suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure has long-term effects on HPA dysregulation in humans.

N2  - Purpose: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are among the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Identification of nutritional factors that may confer risk or provide protection is critical as these factors are potentially modifiable. Although nutritional status for various micronutrients is known to be affected by chronic alcohol consumption in non-pregnant adults, nutritional status in pregnant women who drink moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol has not been well characterized. We hypothesize that nutritional inadequacies increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with alcohol consumption. Methods: As part of an international collaborative study on FASD, we screened pregnant women in Ukraine and prospectively recruited those who reported moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in early pregnancy and those who reported no or low amounts of alcohol as a comparison group. A blood sample was collected at the time of enrollment (17-18 wks gestation on average) and analyzed for vitamin, mineral and oxidative stress status. Results: We have completed analysis of blood samples for 35 alcohol-exposed women, and 31 comparison pregnant women. Significantly or marginally significantly lower plasma zinc (Zn; p=0.051) and plasma copper (Cu; p=0.019) levels were noted in the alcohol-exposed group relative to unexposed women. We also noted significantly lower ceruloplasmin (Cp) activity (p= 0.036) and TRAP (Total Antioxidant Capacity of Plasma; p=0.006) in the alcohol-exposed group vs. unexposed. Plasma Zn was negatively correlated with TBARs, a lipid peroxidation index, and Cp was positively correlated with TRAP. Conclusion: The compromised Zn and Cu status observed in alcohol-exposed women is consistent with predictions that susceptibility to alcohol-related fetal effects may be influenced by maternal micronutrient deficiencies. Alcohol toxicity is thought to be due in part to oxidative damage; our initial data also show increased oxidative stress with alcohol exposure. Thus, mid-gestation levels of key measures of oxidative stress or antioxidant reserves could be important risk modifiers for alcohol-related adverse pregnancy outcomes. As sample size requirements are met, this continuing study will evaluate the influence of baseline status on these and other nutritional measures on risk for characteristic physical features of FASD, growth, and neurodevelopment in the offspring.

N2  - Purpose: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is among the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Identification of the risks associated with specific dose and gestational timing of alcohol exposure for the characteristic physical features of FASD is needed to aid in diagnosis, particularly in the newborn period, and to provide accurate counseling to pregnant women. Methods: In 2005-6, we screened pregnant women in two regions in Ukraine and prospectively recruited 84 women who reported moderate to heavy alcohol consumption and 82 women who reported little to no alcohol drinking. Women were interviewed at enrollment regarding alcohol exposure in the month around conception and in the previous two-week period using a time-line follow-back method. Following delivery, specially trained geneticists in Ukraine performed blinded physical examinations of infants using a standard checklist of physical features of FASD. Infants who had the cardinal features of FAS including growth deficiency and facial features were classified as "FAS", infants who had some features but final diagnosis required assessment of neurobehavioral performance were classified as "Deferred", and infants with no features were classified as "No FAS". Level of alcohol consumption was compared across the three groups using ANOVA and ANCOVA in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Results: A total of 141 infants were examined by study geneticists. Five infants (3.5%) met criteria for "FAS", 45 infants (31.9%) were "Deferred", and 91 infants (64.5%) were classified as "No FAS". Average daily consumption of absolute ounces of alcohol in both the periconceptional (p=0.002) and the previous two weeks (p < 0.001) was correlated with physical features of FASD after adjustment for maternal tobacco and vitamin use. Average consumption of absolute ounces of alcohol per drinking day in both time periods was also significantly associated with features of FAS (p=0.015 and p < 0.001, respectively). Infants who were classified as "FAS", "Deferred", and "No FAS" were exposed to adjusted means of ~3 drinks, ~2 drinks, and ~1.5 drinks per drinking day in the periconceptional period; slightly lower levels were reported in the most recent two weeks. Conclusion: There is a strong dose-response relation between number of physical features of FASD and quantity of alcohol consumed in early pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: The spectrum of facial and neurobehavioral abnormalities observed among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure makes identification of these individuals difficult. The objective of this study was to explore if a combination of information from anthropometric measures obtained directly and from 3D images and neurobehavioral variables could be used to accurately identify exposed subjects. Methods: As part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), 3D facial images and data from a broad neurobehavioral protocol were collected from 52 children and adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure and 39 non-exposed controls from Helsinki, Finland (35 exposed, 30 non-exposed) and San Diego, CA (17 exposed, 9 non-exposed). Of the exposed subjects, 37 were diagnosed with FAS using the dysmorphological examination procedures of the CIFASD dysmorphology core. For each subject 16 indirect facial measurements, head circumference (direct measurement), and a subset of 29 neurobehavioral variables which had previously been identified as having high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating children with FASD from controls were analyzed. Stepwise discriminant analysis was performed and the percent correct classifications are reported. Performance of the discriminant function was assessed by cross-validation. Results: The most parsimonious model included 4 craniofacial measurements (outer canthal length, nasal length, nasal bridge length, head circumference) and 4 neurobehavioral elements (Delis Kaplan Executive Functioning System: verbal fluency switching, trail making visual scanning; Progressive Planning test: average total time; CANTAB: spatial span total responses). These 8 variables correctly classified 92% of the prenatally exposed and 92% of the non-exposed. There was not a significant difference in classification rates between the samples by site. Thirteen of the 15 subjects, who were prenatally alcohol exposed, but not diagnosed as FAS, were correctly classified as alcohol-exposed. Conclusion: These preliminary results demonstrate that the combination of facial measurements and neurobehavioral test results can reliably identify both previously diagnosed FAS indvidiuals as well as undiagnosed prenatally alcohol exposed individuals. Further studies will focus on other ethnic groups and a broader series of neurobehavioral measures.

N2  - Adaptive function may be especially sensitive to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Previous reports have demonstrated that in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), social skills are negatively associated with age, suggesting deficits in meeting the increasing demands in social functioning. However, this relationship between adaptive function and age in alcohol-exposed children has not been reported in other adaptive domains. We investigated the relation between adaptive function and age in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) and typically developing controls (CON). Additionally, because a current aim of research in FASDs is to identify a distinctive neurobehavioral profile, a clinical contrast group of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was included to determine if observed patterns of adaptive deficits are specific to alcohol exposure. Sixty-five children (ALC=22, ADHD=23, CON=20) were selected from a larger ongoing study of the behavioral teratogenicity of alcohol. ALC and CON subjects were selected to match the ADHD subjects on age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity. Caregivers were administered the VABS, a semi-structured interview, and were asked to rate their child's behavior on three domains of adaptive function (daily living skills, socialization, communication). Data were analyzed using regression techniques. On all three domains, children in both the ALC and ADHD groups showed deficits in adaptive behavior relative to controls. In addition, children in the ALC group were significantly more impaired than the ADHD group on the daily living skills domain. Within the ALC group, socialization and communication standard scores decreased with increasing age. No relations with age were noted in the ADHD or CON groups. This study adds to the growing body of literature aimed at identifying distinct neurobehavioral profiles of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol and suggests that age may be an important factor for characterizing the differential patterns of deficits seen in children with FASDs. Continued research focused on elucidating the patterns of strengths and weaknesses that exist in alcohol-exposed children ultimately will lead to improved differential diagnosis and effective interventions.

N2  - The main aim of the current research was to investigate strategy application by children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in a multitasking situation. Researchers have obtained evidence that patients with frontal lobe damage and children with ADHD display notable difficulty in multitasking and that this difficulty is associated with their behavioral problems in their daily lives. Given that children with FASD have been shown to have deficits in executive functions, we hypothesized that alcohol-exposed children would show greater difficulty with multitasking than controls and that this difficulty would be associated with parent reported behavior problems. Forty children (20 FASD and 20 typically developing), ages 9 through 17, participated. The two groups were matched with respect to age, sex, and SES. The Six-Part Test (Wilson et al., 1996) was administered to assess multitasking ability as part of a larger test battery that included other tests assessing executive functioning (cognitive planning). In the Six-Part Test, the participants were required to complete, within 5 minutes, three types of tasks, each containing two parts, following specific rules. The Progressive Planning Test was utilized to assess cognitive planning ability. Two parent-rated questionnaires - Dysexecutive Questionnaire for Children (DEX-C) and Social Responsiveness Questionnaire-were employed to obtain information on children's behavior. Contrary to expectation, the groups did not differ on the Six-Part Test, but did differ on the PPT. Furthermore, PPT scores, but not Six-Part Test scores, were associated with parent-rated behavior problems. There is some evidence that the posterior cingulate may be critically involved in multitasking and the dorsolateral frontal cortex, in cognitive planning. Therefore, higher-order cognitive deficits rather than a disinhibitory disorder, like ADHD, seem to underlie behavioral problems in children with FASD.

N2  - Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is a Pavlovian paradigm that involves contingent temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (e.g., pure tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., air puff) that elicits a reflexive blink. In short delay conditioning, a 650-ms delay between the onset of the 750-ms tone and the air puff is presented during the final 100 ms of the tone. EBC was examined in 62 Cape Coloured school-age children in Cape Town, South Africa. Mothers provided pregnancy drinking histories, and dysmorphologists examined the children. 6 children met criteria for full FAS, 3 for PFAS, 25 were heavily exposed nondysmorphic, and 28 were non-exposed controls. Among the 34 children born to heavy drinking mothers, 17.6% met criteria for full FAS, a proportion comparable to that seen in our earlier cohort study. Delay EBC was administered to 62 children at 11.3 yr to assess whether the fetal alcohol-related deficit we reported at 5 yr was seen in a second sample of children at an older age. Two sessions consisting of 50 trials each were administered on the same day. 32 of these children were also administered trace EBC at 12.8 yr. This conditioning procedure is the same as delay except that a 500-ms stimulus-free interval occurs between the offset of the tone and the onset of the air puff. Prenatally exposed children were less likely to meet criterion for delay conditioning than controls, v2 (2) = 8.82, p <.005. Only 33.3% with FAS/PFAS and 44.0% of other heavily exposed met criterion, compared with 78.6% of controls. These data indicate that the EBC impairment seen at 5 yr is also evident in older children. As with delay, the more difficult trace conditioning was also highly sensitive to fetal alcohol exposure. Only 12.5% of the FAS/PFAS and 25% of the heavy exposed met criterion for trace conditioning, compared with 66.7% of the controls. The magnitude of the effect of diagnostic group on trace conditioning was virtually identical to the effect on delay (Cramer's V = .48 vs. .47), suggesting that the impact of fetal alcohol on trace is no greaster than on delay. Recent studies with rats also indicate that delay and trace are equally sensitive to developmental alcohol exposure. These data suggest that alcohol-related impairment in the cerebellar circuitry required for both forms of conditioning is sufficient to account for the alcohol-related deficit in both tasks, although targeting of other brain structures by alcohol cannot be ruled out at this point.

N2  - A sample of 8-11 year old children in Cape Town South Africa, were assessed on the Stewart Extended Continuous Performance Test (E-CPT), which assesses both vigilance and response inhibition. Approximately half of the children were heavily exposed to alcohol in utero; the others were born to women who abstained or drank no more than minimally during pregnancy. In the E-CPT single-digit numbers are displayed sequentially on the screen. The child is instructed to press a button whenever the target number ("9") appears. Trials in which the target appears relatively rarely (e.g., 10% or 30% of the time) assess vigilance; those in which the target appears very frequently (e.g., 70% or 90%) assess response inhibition. In one-third of the trials, the numbers are degraded, making the task more challenging from a perceptual point of view. The fetal alcohol exposed children performed more poorly on the degraded trials, showing poorer vigilance on the 10%, 30%, and 50% trials and poorer response inhibition on the 90% trials. By contrast, the children who were suspect for ADHD based on teacher reports using the Disrupted Behavior Disorders assessment exhibited poorer vigilance and response inhibition on the undegraded trials. The findings that the children who were suspect for ADHD performed more poorly on both the vigilance and response inhibition on the undegraded trials suggests greater sensitivity to deficits in both aspects of attention. By contrast, the children with fetal alcohol exposure showed generally less sensitivity to deficits in both aspects of attention in that their performance was impaired only on the more challenging trials involving the degraded stimuli.

N2  - Academic difficulty has been noted as a secondary disability in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). However, it is unclear if observed school difficulties are disproportionate to the diminished general intellectual function documented in this population. Learning disorders are defined as a significant discrepancy between ability (measured as IQ) and academic achievement. This study conducted two sets of analyses to determine if children with FASDs had increased occurrence of learning disorders in verbal and nonverbal domains. For this study, learning disorder of written expression (verbal domain) was defined as a clinically significant (>1 population standard deviation) difference between verbal (VIQ) and verbal achievement (WRAT-3 Spelling); mathematics learning disorder (nonverbal domain) was similarly defined as a clinically significant difference between nonverbal ability (PIQ) and mathematic achievement (WRAT-3 Arithmetic). In the first analysis, 110 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were compared to 126 non-exposed controls matched on race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status. In the second analysis, 55 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were compared to 55 controls well matched on FSIQ (within 5 points), as well as race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status. In the larger sample, children with FASDs were more likely to have a clinically significant difference between PIQ and WRAT-3 Arithmetic and controls were more likely to have a significant difference between VIQ and WRAT-3 Spelling. However, in the smaller matched sample when IQ was well controlled, a higher occurrence of mathematics learning disorder was observed in children with FASDs but no difference in occurrence of learning disorder of written expression was observed between the groups. These results suggest that children with FASDs may have particular difficulty with nonverbal (arithmetic) academic tasks, while verbal academic ability may be more consistent with overall ability. Nonverbal learning disabilities have been associated with white matter changes in the brain, which also occur following heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Further assessment should be conducted to determine if children with FASDs have additional deficits (e.g. visuospatial) consistent with nonverbal learning disability and whether these neuropsychological deficits relate to changes in white matter.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can alter physical, neurological, and behavioral development, resulting in a range of effects referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The outcome among children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy varies widely and some of this variation may be due to nutritional factors. For example, higher rates of FASD are observed in areas where malnutrition is prevalent. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that many women throughout the world may not consume adequate levels of choline, a nutrient that is critical for brain development, during pregnancy. In this study we examined whether choline deficiency might increase the severity of fetal alcohol effects. Sprague-Dawley female rats were randomly assigned to receive diets containing 40, 70 or 100 percent recommended choline levels from two weeks prior to pregnancy through weaning at postnatal day 21. A group from each diet condition was exposed to alcohol (6.0 g/kg/day) from gestational day 5 to 20 via intragastric intubations. Pair-fed and ad lib lab chow control groups were also included. The offspring were examined for physical development and tested on a range of behavioral tasks. Neither prenatal alcohol exposure nor choline deficient diets by themselves produced robust alterations in development. However, subjects exposed to alcohol prenatally and fed a 40% choline-deficient diet exhibited significant delays in eye opening, impaired hind-limb coordination, and hyperactivity. Outcome measures of subjects exposed to alcohol and fed a 70% choline diet was not significantly different from that of alcohol-exposed subjects fed a 100% recommended choline diet. These data indicate that even moderate suboptimal nutritional status may exacerbate some of ethanol's teratogenic effects, a finding with important implications for the prevention of FASD.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can damage the developing CNS, leading to hyperactivity, motor incoordination, and deficits in cognitive functioning. Prenatal exposure to binge-like ethanol, which is characterized by withdrawal periods, is more damaging than continuous exposure. We have hypothesized that NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity occurs during these withdrawal periods, contributing to ethanol-related neuropathology and behavioral deficits. Consistent with this hypothesis, blocking NMDA receptors during withdrawal with MK-801, a potent NMDA receptor antagonist, reduces the severity of alcohol-related neuropathology in the developing rat. However, when administered at the same time as ethanol, MK-801 exacerbates ethanol's teratogenic effects. The present study examined the effects of administering eliprodil, an NMDAR antagonist that acts on the polyamine modulator site, at various times following an ethanol binge. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of seven treatment groups: five alcohol-exposed (AE) (6 g/kg via intubation on postnatal day (PD) 6) and two sham intubation control (IC) groups. Four AE groups were injected with 5 mg/kg eliprodil at 0, 9, 21, or 33 hrs post-ethanol; the fifth AE group was injected with vehicle 21 hrs postethanol. Each IC group was injected with either eliprodil or vehicle, 21 hrs post-ethanol. Subjects were tested for open field activity (PD18-21) and parallel bar motor coordination (PD30-32). Ethanol exposure produced hyperactivity and motor incoordination. Eliprodil administration at 21 hrs post-ethanol, during ethanol withdrawal, significantly ameliorated ethanol-induced hyperactivity, but was not effective at any other time point. Administering eliprodil did not ameliorate ethanol-induced motor incoordination, indicating that its beneficial effects are task-specific. These data provide further evidence that NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity occurs during periods of withdrawal following developmental alcohol exposure. Furthermore, eliprodil did not exacerbate ethanol's effects when administered at 0 or 9 hrs post-ethanol, therefore unlike MK-801, eliprodil is not toxic when administered during alcohol intoxication. These findings indicate that administration of NMDAR antagonists that act at the polyamine modulatory site, may serve as relatively safe and effective interventions for some fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy produces fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and studies suggest that alterations in the expression brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are involved in its etiology. However, little is known about the role of changes in BDNF function on FASD pathophysiology. Recent studies indicate that BDNF-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity play a role in the development of inhibitory synaptic connections. Activitydependent release of BDNF from CA3 pyramidal neurons activates TrkB receptors causing long-term potentiation (LTP) of GABAergic transmission, expressed as an increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABA-A receptor-dependent spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sGABA-A-sPSCs; Gubellini et al., J Neurosci. 25:5796-802, 2005). This form of synaptic plasticity is restricted to the neonatal period of rat development, which is equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. We hypothesized that this sGABA-A-sPSCs LTP is affected by ethanol exposure during this developmental period. To test this hypothesis, we exposed neonatal rat pups with their mothers to air or ethanol between postnatal days (P) 2 and 8 for 4 hours per day (peak serum ethanol concentrations = 40-50 mM). Immediately after the end of the 4 hr exposure, neonatal rats were euthanized and brain coronal slices were then prepared. After a recovery time of 1.5-6 hrs, sGABA-A-PSCs were recorded from CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in presence of kynurenate (1mM) at a holding potential of -65 mV before and after the application of 20 depolarizing pulses (500 ms each, from -85 to 0) delivered at 0.1 Hz. The pulses induced sGABA-A-PSC LTP in slices from neonates exposed to air but not those exposed to ethanol and this effect was reversible 48 hrs after ethanol withdrawal. Bath application of BDNF induced sGABA-A-PSC LTP to a similar extend in both treatment groups, suggesting that TrkB receptor function is unaffected by ethanol and that it rather acts by inhibiting release of endogenous BDNF. These alterations in BDNF-dependent plasticity may impair normal GABAergic synapse development and be a cellular underpinning of the learning and memory alterations that are associated with FASD.

N2  - Recent studies indicate that how an individual copes with environmental stressors can be influenced by a trajectory laid down in fetal life. The broader issue includes fetal brain plasticity or how the fetal brain my encode information about the environment through changes in organization. We are also interested in how prenatal and postnatal environmental risk factors interact with certain genetic variations to influence neurodevelopment. Monkeys in this study were derived from female breeders that consumed 0.6 g/kg daily during gestational days 0 - 50, 50 - 90, 0 - 135 or a sucrose control solution. Infants underwent 4 brief (20 min) neonatal maternal separations to assess emotion regulation and neuromotor development. At 6 months and 32 months they underwent 3-day social separations; blood samples were collected at baseline and post-separation for assessing plasma CORT and ACTH levels. In addition, at 32 months, CSF concentrations of the serotonin metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and the dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA) were assessed. At 9 years of age, high resolution positron emission tomography (PET) neuroligand imaging was used to investigate in vivo receptor density related to DA system function using [18F]Fallypride, [11C]SCH23390, and [18F]FECNT in separate scans to assess D2R, D1R and DAT binding, respectively. Immediately following PET imaging, monkeys were induced to drink alcohol following the Vivian et al (2001) protocol. The three DA PET scans were repeated immediately after cessation of alcohol consumption to investigate possible changes in the DA system after alcohol drinking. During social separations, monkeys exposed to moderate level alcohol during early or middle-late pregnancy carrying the short allele in the serotonin transporter gene promoter region exhibited higher levels of stress hormones and lower CSF concentration of 5-HIAA compared to prenatal alcohol exposed monkeys homozygous for the long allele and monkeys not prenatal alcohol exposed, regardless of genotype. There was consistency within HVA and 5-HIAA across time points (baseline and 50-hour post-separation) and between HVA and 5-HIAA. There was also high consistency within ACTH for 6 and 32 months separations (baseline, 2-hour and 26-hour post-separation) and significant but weaker relationships for CORT. Work is ongoing to assess relationships among stress responsivity, 5-HT and DA function and alcohol consumption patterns.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal exposure to alcohol has been shown to alter the levels of biogenic amines in several regions of the brain. In vitro studies have revealed damage the serotonin (5-HT) system in the brain during the course of neural development. Early life impairment of this system has been linked to behavioral abnormalities and may be related to behaviors often displayed by individuals born with fetal alcohol (FA) exposure. Positron emission tomography (PET) neuroligand imaging is ideally suited to investigate in vivo changes in the serotonin system caused by fetal alcohol exposure. The goal of this work is to investigate the imaging characteristics of a promising 5-HT1A serotonin neuroligand, [F-18]mefway, for measuring potential neurochemical alterations in subjects receiving prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: High resolution PET scans were acquired in the rhesus monkey using [F-18]mefway and compared to the in vivo kinetics of [F-18]MPPF, another more commonly used 5-HT1A PET ligand. The time course of the radiotracer kinetics were followed over the course of 2 hours and arterial plasma samples were acquired to assay the fraction of parent radiotracer. Results: [F-18]Mefway revealed high uptake in the regions of the hippocampus, raphe nuclei and cingulate gyrus. The specifically bound to free (B/F) ratios in these regions was approximately 2-fold greater with [F-18]mefway (B/F = 8 in hippocampus) and approached a pseudo-equilibrium at approximately 60 minutes, suggesting stable measurements of specific binding will be achievable within a reasonable time period (< 2 hours). Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest [F-18]mefway possesses superior imaging characteristics to [F-18]MPPF and will improve the sensitivity for detecting group differences in 5-HT1A binding. Work is ongoing to investigate a cohort of rhesus monkeys receiving prenatal alcohol exposure. [F-18]Mefway PET imaging holds great promise for studying FA-exposure on the development of the 5-HT1A receptors within the serotonergic network of the brain.

N2  - Emerging information indicates that epigenetic modification regulates maintenance and differentiation of neural stem cells. Alcohol abuse during pregnancy attributable to neurodevelopmental deficits and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is known to link with alteration in methyl and acetyl donors, thus epigenetic processes may have a causal input for FAS. In this study, through monitoring both neural tube and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neural stem cell development, we demonstrated the dynamic nature of epigenetic marks throughout neural differentiation, and that alcohol interferes with these epigenetic and developmental processes. The DNA methylation in the neural tube were found to be increased along the differentiation of the neural tube in spatial and temporal pattern as indicated by the markers, 5 Methyl cytosine (5meC) and DNA methyl transferase (DNMT). Alcohol exposure at the stage of neurulation deterred DNA methylation pattern of the neural tube and concurrently the neural tube development. The DRG stem cells also demonstrated epigenetic change as waking from quiescent into differentiating states. The modification of DNA methylation and histone marks was in parallel with phenotype changes. Alcohol inhibited genome-wide DNA hypermethylation and meanwhile affected migration and differentiation. Alcohol also altered nuclear distribution of DNA methylation and histone methylation marks. In verifying the rule of DNA methylation, inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-Aza-cystidine were found to severely disrupt migration and differentiation of DRG stem cells. These results indicate that alcohol alters epigenetic programming while affecting neural differentiation. The causal relationship of epigenetic changes and neural differentiation by alcohol however requires further investigation (support AA016698).

N2  - Objectives: The PASS (Prenatal Alcohol Stillbirth and SIDS) Network is designed to understand the role of prenatal alcohol exposure on adverse pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth. We designed a novel classification system based upon pathologic findings, the PASS Stillbirth Classification, to provide insight into mechanisms of unexplained stillbirth, since we hypothesize prenatal alcohol and/or smoking increase stillbirth risk via direct effects upon the fetus and/or placenta. Materials and Methods: Our schema is based upon 'site of origin' for cause of stillbirth (fetal, placental, maternal, external/ environmental, or undetermined origin), further subdivided into mechanism subcategories. Each Phase I PASS stillbirth was assigned a proximate cause of death and a status of sporadic versus recurrent. Results: Causes of death were: fetal (n = 5, 24% of stillbirths), placental (n = 11, 52%), and undetermined (n = 5, 24%). Nine cases (43%) had placental causes of death due to underlying maternal disorders that carry an a priori recurrence risk. Conclusions: The PASS Stillbirth Classification incorporates mechanism of demise and etiology to address pathophysiology of stillbirth. In these 21 stillbirths, 25% were due to fetal disorders, 50% to placental etiologies, and 25% were of unknown cause. 43% of cases were due placental perfusion failure with an a priori risk for recurrence. This schema will be applied to stillbirths from Phase II pregnancies (n = 12,000) in the PASS Research Network. We hypothesize effects of prenatal alcohol and smoking exposure on pregnancy may modify case stratification and/or demonstrate a concentrated effect in certain stillbirth subsets.

N2  - Objective. To describe the prevalence, characteristics and risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS among schoolgoing children in Grade 1 in Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Design. A cross-sectional study using a two-tiered method for ascertainment of FAS/partial FAS cases, comprising: screening of growth parameters, diagnostic assessment for screen-positive children using clinical and neurocognitive assessments, and maternal history of drinking during pregnancy. Mothers or caregivers of FAS children and matched controls were interviewed. Setting. Primary schools in De Aar (8) and Upington (15). Subjects. Grade 1 pupils in 2001 (De Aar, N=536) and 2002 (Upington, N=1 299). Outcome measures. FAS or partial FAS. Results. The prevalence of FAS/partial FAS was high: 64/536 (119.4/1 000, 95% CI 93.2 - 149.9) in De Aar, and 97/1 299 (74.7/1 000, 95% CI 61.0 - 90.3) in Upington. Overall, 67.2 per 1 000 children (95% CI 56.2 - 79.7) had full FAS features. Growth retardation was also common in this population: 66.6% (1 181/1 774) were underweight, 48.3% (858/1 776) stunted, and 15.1% had a head circumference <2 SD for age. Mothers of children with FAS were less likely to have fulltime employment or have attended secondary school and had lower body mass index, and about 80% currently smoked. Over two-thirds of all pregnancies had been unplanned. Conclusions. A very high proportion of pupils (nearly 1 in 10) had FAS/ partial FAS, the rate in De Aar being the highest yet described in South Africa. FAS/partial FAS may contribute to the extremely high rate of growth retardation in South Africa as a whole and is a major cause of learning disability. These epidemiological features are important in designing preventive interventions.

N2  - Heavy fetal alcohol exposure is associated with a spectrum of neurological abnormalities, although the mechanism of injury is largely unknown. We previously reported attenuated cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia in fetal and newborn sheep which were exposed to alcohol earlier in pregnancy. One possible mechanism for this effect of alcohol on the developing cerebral vasculature is a decrease in cerebral microvessel density, similar to its effect on developing neurons. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal alcohol exposure decreases cerebral microvessel density. Pregnant ewes received intravenous infusions of ethanol or saline during days 60-84 of gestation (term = 150 days) and at 125 days of gestation we obtained the fetal brains for study. We immunohistochemically labeled vessels of the left cerebral forebrain hemispheres with antibody to endothelial nitric oxide synthase and then obtained unbiased stereological estimates of cerebral microvessel density using a modified optical fractionator method. We studied 20 fetal brains of which 9 were alcohol-exposed, 11 were saline-controls, and all were products of a twin gestation. Although brain and body weights were not different between groups, the alcohol-exposed group had significantly lower brain weight as a percentage of body weight. Estimates of cerebral microvessel density were not significantly different between alcohol-exposed and saline-control groups: 12.7 +/- 8.7 and 9.1 +/- 2.8 microvessels per mm3, respectively (mean +/- SD, p = 0.32). Since there is no change in estimated cerebral microvessel density after prenatal alcohol exposure, we conclude that decreased cerebral microvessel density is not a likely explanation for attenuated cerebral blood flow in response to hypoxia. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: A multi-state consortium was developed in the US to conduct baseline data collection and intervention research on fetal alcohol syndrome. Each state employed support specialists whose job it was to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption in women who were at high risk for drinking alcohol during their pregnancy. The purpose of this paper is to report how support specialists in three primarily rural/frontier states were trained to assess client need and how client need was actually assessed in the field. Methods: A qualitative process evaluation was conducted using semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted with state staff involved in support specialist training and consortium activities and the support specialists themselves. Inductive analyses were conducted with interview data. Results: Need determination varied by state and for one state within the state. How support specialists were trained to assess need and how need was assessed in the field was mostly congruent. Conclusion: Process evaluation is an effective method for providing practical and useful answers to questions that cannot be answered by outcome evaluation alone. © 2007 Christopher et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether fetal alcohol exposure contributes to alcohol use in adolescence. In this study, we examine the association between maternal alcohol use in pregnancy and adolescents' drinking patterns at age 14. METHODS: The association of maternal alcohol exposure with early drinking was examined in 4363 adolescents taking part to the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) and its outcomes, a population based birth cohort study commenced in Brisbane (Australia) in 1981. Mothers and children were followed up at birth, 5 and 14 years after the initial interview. Maternal alcohol use was assessed before and during pregnancy and at the 5 years follow-up. Adolescents' alcohol use was assessed at child age 14. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis those born of mothers who consumed 3+ glasses during pregnancy were at increased risk to report drinking 3+ glasses compared with those whose mothers reported no drinking or drinking up to 2 glasses. Comparisons controlling for drinking before pregnancy and at age 5 found the averaged odds ratio of maternal drinking in pregnancy on risk of reporting alcohol consumption of 3 and more glasses at age 14 was 2.74 (CI 1.70, 4.22). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that they maybe a biological origin of early drinking. Further studies are needed to better disentangle the nature of the association and the role of other possible confounding factors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the most common form of nongenetic birth defect in North America with devastating, long-term consequences. Physicians are the primary providers of medical care for pregnant women and they play an important role in the prevention and diagnosis of FASD. We sought to determine whether differences exist between rural and urban health care providers in knowledge of, attitudes about and awareness of FASD and preconception counselling. METHODS: Surveys were mailed to a national, random sample of Canadian health care providers (n = 5361) between October 2001 and May 2002. Bivariate data analysis was completed using SPSS 14.0. RESULTS: Compared with their urban counterparts, rural providers were more likely to report being prepared to access resources related to alcohol use and dependency, yet they were less likely to agree that it was the physician's role to manage these issues (78.4% v. 82.8%, p < 0.05). Rural providers were more likely than urban providers to use a standardized tool to screen patients for alcohol use, to ask all pregnant women if they were drinking, to have cared for a patient with an FASD (56.7% v. 48.8%), to agree that providers do not make a diagnosis because of lack of time and training, and to recognize legal issues and inappropriate behaviour as secondary outcomes of FASD. Rural and urban providers were similar in their diagnostic knowledge of FASD. CONCLUSION: Few differences between rural and urban providers exist with regard to knowledge and diagnosis of FASD; however, rural providers are more prepared to access resources for women with addiction issues and are more likely to care for patients with an FASD.

T1  - The effectiveness of a multimedia program to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Lachausse R.G.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) continues to be the leading preventable cause of mental retardation in the United States. Because abstaining from alcohol prior to and throughout pregnancy is the only way to prevent FAS, some prevention programs try to target women before they become pregnant. The Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Teaching and Research Awareness Campaign (FASTRAC) is a multimedia, peer-delivered educational presentation designed to reduce the incidence of FAS. Results from an ethnically diverse sample of high school students indicate that the program increased participants' knowledge regarding FAS but had no significant effect on participants' attitudes, beliefs about the dangers of FAS or intention to use alcohol during pregnancy. The FASTRAC program failed partly because of its didactic approach and the lack of health education principles that have been shown to be effective in changing other substance use behaviors. Suggestions for improving FAS prevention education programs are offered.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Preventing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) by encouraging pregnant women to abstain from drinking alcohol competes with commercial alcohol marketing. Two FAS-prevention campaigns using a narrowcast approach among young women of childbearing age in two disadvantaged Southern California communities are compared. The design, implementation process, and degree to which campaigns reached the priority populations are the focus of this article. Formative research shows that young women in disadvantaged communities receive mixed messages about dangers of drinking during pregnancy. A social norms approach using positive role models was the most acceptable message strategy based on materials pretesting. Differences in campaign implementation and distribution strategies between communities were documented through program monitoring. Survey research indicated the more viable messaging and implementation strategies. Findings show that low-cost community campaigns are feasible; however, variations in messaging, distribution strategies, and saturation levels determine whether such campaigns succeed or fail to reach priority populations.

N2  - Disrupted sensory processing, characterized by over- or underresponsiveness to environmental stimuli, has been reported in children with a variety of developmental disabilities. This study examined the effects of prenatal stress and moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure on tactile sensitivity and its relationship to striatal dopamine system function in thirty-eight 5- to 7-year-old rhesus monkeys. The monkeys were from four experimental conditions: (a) prenatal alcohol exposed, (b) prenatal stress, (c) prenatal alcohol exposed + prenatal stress, and (d) sucrose controls. Increased D2 receptor binding in the striatum, evaluated using positron emission tomography neuroimaging, was related to increased withdrawal (aversion) responses to repetitive tactile stimuli and reduced habituation across trials. Moreover, prenatal stress significantly increased overall withdrawal responses to repetitive tactile stimulation compared to no prenatal stress. © 2008 by the Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

N2  - Visual attention problems have been reported in association with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). With related behavioral data documented in literature, further investigation of this PAE effect would benefit from integrating functional and anatomical imaging data to ascertain its neurobiological basis. The current study investigated the possible functional and anatomical bases for the PAE-related visual sustained attention deficit. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected while the subjects performed a sustained visual attention task. High resolution, three dimensional anatomical images were also collected for morphometric evaluation. In the alcohol-affected subjects, we observed a significant white and gray matter volume reduction in the occipital-temporal area. Meanwhile, their fMRI activations in the same region resided more superiorly than that of the controls resulting in reduced activation in the ventral occipital-temporal area. The location of this PAE functional abnormality approximately matches that of the significant structural reduction. In addition to the well documented corpus callosum abnormalities observed in PAE subjects, the present results reveal a teratogenic effect on the occipital-temporal area. Furthermore, as the occipital-temporal area plays an important role in visual attention, the current observation suggests a neurobiological underpinning for the PAE related deficit in sustained visual attention. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

N2  - Light and electron microscopy were used to study the characteristics of the formation of brain vascular structures at the early stages of development in conditions of maternal alcoholization during pregnancy. Computer morphometric methods using the Scion Image system for image analysis showed that fetuses at 11-12 weeks of development in conditions of prenatal alcohol exposure showed a decrease in the mean absolute cross-sectional area of vessels in the intermediate layer of the brain, with an increase in their relative area and an increase per unit area of sections, as compared with the control group. Vessels started to differentiate into arteries and veins from 10 weeks of development. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

N2  - Background: The largest cause of neurological damage to children is prenatal exposure to alcohol and chronic alcohol use in adults is associated with neurodegeneration, dementia and long-term behavioral changes. Microarray analysis identified the DNA damage response (DDR) gene, Fanconi anemia (Fanc) D2, to be robustly upregulated in mouse midbrain following 24-hour in vivo exposure to ethanol. In this study, we investigate the ability of ethanol to generate DNA strand breaks, predicted substrates for the Fanc pathway and the potential role of FANCD2 in the DDR to ethanol in brain. Methods: The effect of ethanol on FANCD2 mRNA levels was measured by quantitative real time PCR using mouse brain and human neuronal cells. FANCD2 protein levels and ubiquitination were measured by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. DNA damage induction by ethanol/acetaldehyde was measured using the Comet assay and H2AX immunocytochemistry. Levels of DNA and RNA synthesis were measured in cell strains using 3H-thymidine or 3H-uri-dine up-take. Results: Chronic exposure to ethanol induced FANCD2 in mouse midbrain in vivo and in the nucleus of human neuronal cells in culture. However, there was no concomitant increase in the amount of ubiquitinated FANCD2. Acetaldehyde also induced nonubiquitinated FANCD2 protein, and we were able to demonstrate the ability of acetaldehyde to generate DNA double strand breaks, lesions which normally induce ubiquitination of FANCD2. Ethanol also inhibited both RNA and DNA synthesis in proliferating cells consistent with effects on transcription and replication. Conclusion: In contrast to other DNA damaging agents, ethanol/acetaldehyde generated DNA strand breaks without inducing ubiquitination of FANCD2, despite increasing protein levels in the nucleus. These data are consistent with recent reports that suggest the Fanconi anemia pathway plays an important role in the adult brain in response to DNA damage. Further work is required to establish what this role is, in particular the potential function of nonubiquitinated FANCD2 and its role in the DNA damage response in postmitotic neurons and neural precursor cells.

N2  - The present study aimed to locate a critical period for ethanol-induced spatial task impairments in the animals exposed to alcohol during the fetal life. Two month old rats born from mothers treated with alcohol (5.7 g kg-1) during the 1st half (FH) and 2nd half (SH) and, the 1st (FQ), 2nd (SQ), 3d (TQ) and 4th quarter (FoQ) of gestational period were subjected to the working memory task. The experiments were carried out on an eight arm radial maze across 16 trials. The data presented here indicate that the animals in the FH group displayed a poor performance while those in the SH group had no problem in performing the maze task. Thus, it was concluded that the FH of pregnancy period is more sensitive to toxic effects of ethanol on the spatial task. Also, the FQ and SQ group's performance indicated that the latter was significantly weak in solving the maze task. The animals related to the TQ and FoQ groups displayed a similar behavior with the control rats. Findings of this study demonstrated that drinking alcohol during pregnancy underlies cognitive phenomena m offspring. Noticeably, the second 5 days of the fetal life in the rats is more susceptible to deleterious effects of alcohol on the spatial tasks. © 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

T1  - Cerebellar disorders in childhood: Cognitive problems
A1  - Steinlin M.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Over the last decade, increasing evidence of cognitive functions of the cerebellum during development and learning processes could be ascertained. Posterior fossa malformations such as cerebellar hypoplasia or Joubert syndrome are known to be related to developmental problems in a marked to moderate extent. More detailed analyses reveal special deficits in attention, processing speed, visuospatial functions, and language. A study about Dandy Walker syndrome states a relationship of abnormalities in vermis lobulation with developmental problems. Further lobulation or volume abnormalities of the cerebellum and/or vermis can be detected in disorders as fragile X syndrome, Downs's syndrome, William's syndrome, and autism. Neuropsychological studies reveal a relation of dyslexia and attention deficit disorder with cerebellar functions. These functional studies are supported by structural abnormalities in neuroimaging in these disorders. Acquired cerebellar or vermis atrophy was found in groups of children with developmental problems such as prenatal alcohol exposure or extreme prematurity. Also, focal lesions during childhood or adolescence such as cerebellar tumor or stroke are related with neuropsychological abnormalities, which are most pronounced in visuospatial, language, and memory functions. In addition, cerebellar atrophy was shown to be a bad prognostic factor considering cognitive outcome in children after brain trauma and leukemia. In ataxia teleangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily the cerebellar cortex, a reduced verbal intelligence quotient and problems of judgment of duration are a hint of the importance of the cerebellum in cognition. In conclusion, the cerebellum seems to play an important role in many higher cognitive functions, especially in learning. There is a suggestion that the earlier the incorrect influence, the more pronounced the problems. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can seriously harm the fetus, dependent on time, duration and frequency of exposure. The variety of outcomes is subsumed under the term <> (FASD). Diagnostic classification by means of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code results from the occurence of four key characteristics: Growth retardation, facial anomalies, CNS abnormalities (microcephaly, mental retardation, functional problems and behavioral problems) and prenatal alcohol exposure. As the facial characteristics are often discrete, the focus lies on the behavioral problems. Foster parents (most of the affected children do not stay with their biological parents) are overstrained by the everyday life with their alcohol affected children. An early diagnosis is necessary to release the foster families and to develop an appropriate concept for supporting the children according to their capabilities. Therefore a supportive network of attending pediatricians, <>, therapists and youth welfare offices with specific support for foster parents. This network aims at avoiding the adverse development and the multiple punishment of the affected children by brain dysfunction, postnatal traumatic experiences in the birth families and the danger of anew breakups of relationships due to the serious behavioral problems. Primary prevention, multigenerational projects and the acceptance of FASD as a disability pose a challenge to the whole society.

N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy leads to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in their children. FASD is characterized by typical facial features, growth retardation, intellectual dysfunction and behavioral problems. Justification: Alcohol is neurotoxic to the brain during the developmental stage. Behavioral problems in children with FASD start at an early age and progress to adulthood. It is an important preventable cause of intellectual dysfunction and behavioral problems. This article reviews current prevalence, clinical features, pathogenesis and differential diagnosis of FASD. It also highlights the need for physicians to be aware of this condition. Search strategy: Articles were searched on the internet using 'fetal alcohol syndrome', 'fetal alcohol spectrum disorders', 'women and alcohol'. Following links were used to locate journals; EBSCO, OVID, Science Direct, PubMed and NIAAA. Main conclusions: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a spectrum of deficits. Though physical features are essential to make the diagnosis of FAS, it is important to note that neurocognitive and behavioural deficits can be present in the absence of physical features (alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder or ARND). Because there is no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, abstinence from alcohol for women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy must be strongly advised.

N2  - Objective: Although the classic features of fetal alcohol syndrome have been recognized since 1968, research on alcohol teratogenesis has only recently demonstrated that the brain is the organ in the body most vulnerable to the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. In this present article, we reviewed the literature focusing mainly on behavioral disturbances related to prenatal ethanol exposure. Sources: We performed a PubMed search on the literature published between 1968 and 2006 using the terms ethanol, pregnancy and behavior. We limited our search to studies on humans. Summary of the findings: The data presented in this review suggested that youths with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are at risk of disruptive social behavior, among other neurobehavioral abnormalities. Conclusions: Although it is still impossible to completely separate brain teratogenesis secondary to alcohol exposure from environmental postnatal influences as the definite cause for these outcomes, the pediatrician should be encouraged to early diagnose children affected by fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This provides proper management and care and avoids long-term consequences on their behavior, besides ensuring better and productive school and social adaptation.

N2  - Ethanol is now considered the most common human teratogen. Educational campaigns have not reduced the incidence of ethanol-mediated teratogenesis, leading to a growing interest in the development of therapeutic prevention or mitigation strategies. On the basis of the observation that maternal ethanol consumption reduces maternal and fetal pH, we hypothesized that a pH-sensitive pathway involving the TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium channels (TASKs) is implicated in ethanol-induced injury to the fetal cerebellum, one of the most sensitive targets of prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant ewes were intravenously infused with ethanol (258 +/- 10 mg/dl peak blood ethanol concentration) or saline in a "3 days/wk binge" pattern throughout the third trimester. Quantitative stereological analysis demonstrated that ethanol resulted in a 45% reduction in the total number of fetal cerebellar Purkinje cells, the cell type most sensitive to developmental ethanol exposure. Extracellular pH manipulation to create the same degree and pattern of pH fall caused by ethanol (manipulations large enough to inhibit TASK 1 channels), resulted in a 24% decrease in Purkinje cell number. We determined immunohistochemically that TASK 1 channels are expressed in Purkinje cells and that the TASK 3 isoform is expressed in granule cells of the ovine fetal cerebellum. Pharmacological blockade of both TASK 1 and TASK 3 channels simultaneous with ethanol effectively prevented any reduction in fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell number. These results demonstrate for the first time functional significance of fetal cerebellar two-pore domain pH-sensitive channels and establishes them as a potential therapeutic target for prevention of ethanol teratogenesis.

N2  - Background: Although a large body of literature exists on cognitive functioning in alcohol-exposed children, it is unclear if there is a signature neuropsychological profile in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study assesses cognitive functioning in children with FASD from several American Indian reservations in the Northern Plains States, and it applies a hierarchical model of simple versus complex information processing to further examine cognitive function. We hypothesized that complex tests would discriminate between children with FASD and culturally similar controls, while children with FASD would perform similar to controls on relatively simple tests. Methods: Our sample includes 32 control children and 24 children with a form of FASD [fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) = 10, partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) = 14]. The test battery measures general cognitive ability, verbal fluency, executive functioning, memory, and fine-motor skills. Results: Many of the neuropsychological tests produced results consistent with a hierarchical model of simple versus complex processing. The complexity of the tests was determined "a priori" based on the number of cognitive processes involved in them. Multidimensional scaling was used to statistically analyze the accuracy of classifying the neurocognitive tests into a simple versus complex dichotomy. Hierarchical logistic regression models were then used to define the contribution made by complex versus simple tests in predicting the significant differences between children with FASD and controls. Complex test items discriminated better than simple test items. The tests that conformed well to the model were the Verbal Fluency, Progressive Planning Test (PPT), the Lhermitte memory tasks, and the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT). The FASD-grouped children, when compared with controls, demonstrated impaired performance on letter fluency, while their performance was similar on category fluency. On the more complex PPT trials (problems 5 to 8), as well as the Lhermitte logical tasks, the FASD group performed the worst. Conclusions: The differential performance between children with FASD and controls was evident across various neuropsychological measures. The children with FASD performed significantly more poorly on the complex tasks than did the controls. The identification of a neurobehavioral profile in children with prenatal alcohol exposure will help clinicians identify and diagnose children with FASD. © Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Hepatic insulin resistance induced by prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with reduced PTEN and TRB3 acetylation in adult rat offspring
A1  - Yao X.-H.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (EtOH) results in insulin resistance in rats of both sexes with increased expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes and glucose production. To investigate whether hepatic insulin signaling is defective, we studied 3-mo-old female offspring of dams that were given EtOH during pregnancy compared with those from pair-fed and control dams. We performed an intraperitoneal pyruvate tolerance test, determined the phosphorylation status of hepatic phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), Akt, and PKC before and after intravenous insulin bolus, and measured mRNA and in vivo acetylation of TRB3 (tribbles 3) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) as well as the expression of the histone acetylase (HAT) PCAF (p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor), histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), and HAT and HDAC activities. In EtOH compared with pair-fed and control offspring, basal and pyruvate-induced blood glucose was increased, insulin-induced PDK1, Akt, and PKC phosphorylation was reduced, and expression of PTEN and TRB3 was increased while their acetylation status was decreased in association with increased HDAC and decreased HAT activities. Thus female adult rats prenatally exposed to EtOH have increased gluconeogenesis, reduced insulin signaling, and increased PTEN and TRB3 expression in the liver. In addition, PTEN and TRB3 are hypoacetylated, which can contribute to Akt-inhibiting activity. These results suggest that hepatic insulin resistance in rats prenatally exposed to EtOH is explained, at least in part, by increased PTEN and TRB3 activity due to both increased gene expression and reduced acetylation.

N2  - Adult rats and mice born to dams exposed to alcohol (fetal alcohol-exposed 'FAE') exhibit enhanced activity of their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis when exposed to stressors. However, the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain incompletely understood. Here two possibilities are reviewed: one that pertains to nitric oxide (NO), an unstable gas that stimulates the HPA axis; and one that focuses on catecholamines, which also stimulate this axis. Significant alterations were not observed in levels of NO synthase, the enzyme responsible for NO formation, in the paraventricula nucleus (PVN) of FAE rats. However, the stimulatory influence of this gas on the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis was enhanced in these animals, thereby providing a mechanism likely to participate in the neuroendocrine hyperactivity that is the hallmark of this model. It was also recently shown that, while the ability of catecholamines to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was comparable in control rats and rats exposed to alcohol during embryonic development, there was a significant upregulation of the C1 brain-stem region when these latter animals were exposed to mild footshocks. Since this region sends prominent projections to the PVN, its increased activity may participate in the HPA axis hyperactivity observed in FAE offspring. Finally, microarray technology was used to search for potential differences in genes present in the brains of control and FAE mice. When these brains were collected on day 17.5 of embryonic development, several genes were upregulated, while others were downregulated, which may provide potential new candidates that mediate the influence of prenatal alcohol on the HPA axis of adult offspring. © 2008 New York Academy of Sciences.

T1  - Chronic binge ethanol-mediated acidemia reduces availability of glutamine and related amino acids in maternal plasma of pregnant sheep

N2  - Heavy drinking during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), of which, fetal and postnatal growth retardation and central nervous system deficits are cardinal features. Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed, none fully account for these deficiencies. We have previously reported that maternal ethanol exposure (1.75 g/kg) results in transient acidemia in the mother and fetus. Alterations in pH are known to regulate glutamine homeostasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that chronic binge ethanol-mediated acidosis reduces glutamine concentrations in maternal plasma that result in decreases in the circulating levels of amino acids related to glutamine metabolism. Pregnant ewes were divided into three groups: ethanol (1.75 g/kg), saline control, and acidemia (inspired fractional carbon dioxide [CO2] was manipulated to mimic the maternal arterial pH pattern created by ethanol). The experiment was conducted on three consecutive days followed by four days without treatment beginning on gestational day (GD) 109, continuing to GD 132. Plasma samples were analyzed for nutrients and metabolites using HPLC and spectrophotometric methods. Maternal plasma concentrations of glutamate increased (58%), whereas glutamine, citrulline, and arginine decreased (between 14 and 53%) in response to an acute challenge after the chronic exposure in ethanol-treated ewes. No differences in these amino acid concentrations were noted between the ethanol and acidemic group subjects. Maternal plasma lactate levels increased by ~100% in response to ethanol, whereas glucose and urea levels did not change in any group. We conclude that maternal chronic binge ethanol consumption results in acidosis-mediated reductions in circulating levels of glutamine and related amino acids that could be responsible for neuronal deficits, altered fetal growth, development, and programming. We also speculate that the consequent increase in fetal glutamate during critical periods of brain development may contribute to the pathogenesis of FAS. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Cell proliferation and differentiation are critical processes in a developing fetal rat brain, during which programmed cell death (PCD) also plays an important role. One of the decisive factors for PCD is Bcl-2 family proteins, where Bax induces cell death, whereas Bcl-2 acts as an inhibitor of PCD. As maternal drinking is known to cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or malformation of the fetal brain during pregnancy, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether maternal ethanol exposure alters the PCD-related Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression during fetal brain development. Pregnant female rats were orally treated with 10% ethanol and the subsequent expressions of the Bax and Bcl-2 proteins examined in the fetal brain, including the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, from gestational day (GD) 15.5 to GD 19.5, using Western blots, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. With regard to the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax proteins (Bcl-2/Bax), the Bax protein was dominant in the forebrain and midbrain of the control GD 15.5 fetuses, except for the hindbrain, when compared with the respective ethanol-treated groups. Moreover, Bcl-2 became dominant in the midbrain of the control GD 17.5 fetuses when compared with the ethanol-treated group, representing an alternation of the natural PCD process by ethanol. Furthermore, a differential expression of the Bcl-2 and Bax proteins was found in the differentiating and migrating zones of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Thus, when taken together, the present results suggest that ethanol affects PCD in the cell differentiation and migration zones of the prenatal rat brain by modulating Bax and Bcl-2 expression in an age- and area-dependent manner. Therefore, this is the first evidence that ethanol may alter FAS-associated embryonic brain development through the alteration of Bax and Bcl-2 expression. © The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

N2  - Introduction: The present review describes the different variants of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) as a consequence of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. According to international findings, some 3 000 to 4 000 affected newborns may be expected annually in Germany. Detection of these individuals in clinical practise is insufficient. Method: Selective review of the literature and report of own findings based on long-term outcome studies. Results: Key features of FASD are short stature, microcephaly, various dysmorphic features, in severe cases amongst others consisting of congenital heart disease and dysplasias of the skeleton and urogenital system, varying degrees of developmental delay including mental retardation, and a positive history of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. Long-term outcome studies in young adulthood show that independent of the severity of FASD the key features remain associated with limitations of an independent life-style. Discussion: Pathogenesis of FASD is not sufficiently clear and there is no causal treatment. Thus, besides prevention and information, early diagnosis, installation of fostering or adoption, and intensive psychosocial care including selection of appropriate schooling, occupational counselling and supportive care in adulthood are mandatory. © Deutscher Arzte-Verlag; entwickelt von L.N.

N2  - Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) show deficits in verbal learning and spatial memory, as well as abnormal hippocampal development. The relationship between their memory and neuroanatomic impairments, however, has not been directly explored. Given that the hippocampus is integral for the synthesis and retrieval of learned information and is particularly vulnerable to the teratogenic effects of alcohol, we assessed whether reduced learning and recall abilities in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are associated with abnormal hippocampal volumes. Nineteen children with FASDs and 18 typically developing controls aged 9 to 15 years were assessed for verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall and underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Images were analyzed for total intracranial volume and for right and left hippocampal volumes. Results revealed smaller left hippocampi and poorer verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall performance in children with FASDs than controls, as well as positive correlations between selective memory indices and hippocampal volumes only in the FASD group. Additionally, hippocampal volumes increased significantly with age in controls only, suggesting that PAE may be associated with long-term abnormalities in hippocampal development that may contribute to impaired verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall. © 2008 INS.

N2  - Background: The precise pathway by which alcohol causes the characteristic features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is unknown. Proposed mechanisms for fetal injury from maternal alcohol use include cellular damage from oxidative stress and impaired fetal oxygenation related to maternal systemic vasoconstriction. Our objective was to compare the levels of urinary markers of oxidative stress and systemic vasoconstriction between women consuming large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy and women who did not drink alcohol during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women consuming >48 g alcohol per day (n = 29) on average and pregnant women who abstained from alcohol use (n = 39) were identified using detailed interviews and home visits. Random maternal urine specimens were collected. Urinary levels of the oxidative stress marker, 8-isoprostane F2alpha, and of the vasoactive prostaglandin metabolites, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (a vasodilator) and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (a vasoconstrictor), were measured using mass spectrometric methods. All analyte levels were corrected for urinary creatinine. Results: In crude analyses, there was no significant difference in 8-isoprostane F2alpha between pregnant drinkers and nondrinkers (2.16 vs. 2.08 ng/mg creatinine, respectively, p = 0.87). There were no significant differences between the drinking and nondrinking groups in levels of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (1.03 vs. 1.17 ng/mg creatinine, repectively, p = 0.50), 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (0.72 vs. 0.59 ng/mg creatinine, respectively, p = 0.21), or the ratio of vasodilatory metabolite to vasoconstrictive metabolite (1.73 vs. 2.72, respectively, p = 0.14). Adjusting for maternal age, marital status, smoking, and gestational age at sampling did not substantially alter the results. Conclusion: Our results show no difference in levels of urinary eicosanoid markers of oxidative stress and systemic vasoconstriction between pregnant women who drink heavily and pregnant women who abstain. These findings speak against a role for maternal oxidative stress or systemic vasoconstriction in the pathogenesis of alcohol damage to the fetus.

N2  - Introduction: Characteristics of Northern Plains American Indian maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or incomplete FAS are described to more effectively prevent fetal FAS and alcohol use during pregnancy. Methods: Study 1 had 27 maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with FAS and Study 2 had 18 grandmothers with grandchildren who had incomplete FAS (cases) which were compared with 119 maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren without FAS (controls). The grandchildren were born between 1981 and 1993 on the Northern Plains. Medical records were manually reviewed for each case and control grandmother. Data were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel chi square. Results: Study 1 case grandmothers were more likely to experience medical problems (70.4%) including trauma (48.1%) and injuries (51.9%) than the controls. Most of the Study 1 and 2 case grandmothers (92.6% and 77.8%, respectively) had alcohol use documented in their medical records compared to less than half of the control grandmothers. Seven (15.6%) of the case grandmothers had more than one grandchild in either Study 1 or Study 2. Conclusion: Maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with FAS had significantly higher rates of alcohol use and alcohol-related medical problems than control grandmothers. Antenatal care providers should screen pregnant women for alcohol use at their first visit. The provider needs to ask the women who are using alcohol about their mothers' use of alcohol to provide appropriate care and counseling for the women and prevent FAS. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Women giving birth to children with fetal alcohol syndrome have a higher risk of early mortality. However, the risk of increased mortality associated with drinking at lower levels during pregnancy has not been evaluated previously. Accordingly, mortality at 20 years post recruitment was examined in a sample (N = 570) of women recruited between 1980 and 1986, who drank more than 1 ounce of absolute alcohol per week (oz AA/wk) during pregnancy and compared to that in abstainers from the same low socioeconomic, African-American population. Using data from archival information and state mortality records, Cox proportional hazards survival models were constructed to determine whether alcohol use, cigarette use, infant birth weight, infant dysmorphia, and alcohol use and abuse by the woman's own mother (family history positive) were associated with increased risk for mortality. At follow-up (in 2003), 9.5% of the sample had died, with the rate for controls being 3.6%, for those alcohol users who stopped during pregnancy, 12.7%, and for the alcohol users who continued drinking throughout pregnancy, 12.5%. Thus, women using alcohol in pregnancy, whether they stopped or continued to use, were significantly (chi2 (2) = 12.1, P < .01) more likely than abstainers to have died before follow-up. Nondrinkers' mortality rate was lower than that of other women from this low-income, high-risk population, whereas the drinkers' rate was 2.7 times higher. In a multivariate analysis, factors contributing to mortality risk included alcohol use and cigarette smoking, but not infant birth weight. Drinking at any level during pregnancy should be regarded as a risk factor for the mother as well as for offspring. Health care professionals working with such women should provide counseling and support for abstinence. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure causes abnormal brain development, leading to behavioral deficits, some of which can be ameliorated by environmental enrichment. As both environmental enrichment and prenatal alcohol exposure can individually alter neurotrophin expression, we studied the interaction of prenatal alcohol and postweaning environmental enrichment on brain neurotrophin levels in rats. Methods: Pregnant rats received alcohol by gavage, 0, 4, or 6 g/kg/d (Zero, Low, or High groups), or no treatment (Naive group), on gestational days 8 to 20. After weaning on postnatal day 21, offspring were housed for 6 weeks in Isolated, Social, or Enriched conditions. Levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) were then measured in frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar vermis. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure increased NGF levels in frontal cortex (High-dose group) and cerebellar vermis (High- and Low-dose groups); increased BDNF in frontal cortex, occipital cortex and hippocampus (Low-dose groups), and increased NT-3 in hippocampus and cerebellar vermis (High-dose). Environmental enrichment resulted in lower NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 levels in occipital cortex and lower NGF in frontal cortex. The only significant interaction between prenatal alcohol treatment and environment was in cerebellar vermis where NT-3 levels were higher for enriched animals after prenatal alcohol exposure, but not for animals housed under Isolated or Social conditions. Conclusions: Both prenatal alcohol exposure and postweaning housing conditions alter brain neurotrophin levels, but the effects appear to be largely independent. Although environmental enrichment can improve functional outcomes, these results do not provide strong support for the hypothesis that rearing in a complex environment ameliorates prenatal alcohol effects on brain neurotrophin levels in rats.

N2  - Background: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments, including structural brain damage. Despite the importance of white matter connections for proper brain function, little is known about how these connections, and the deep gray matter structures that act as relay stations, are affected in children with FASD. The purpose of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging, an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique, to examine microstructural differences of white and deep gray matter in children with FASD. Methods: Subjects were 24 children aged 5-13 years previously diagnosed with FASD and 95 healthy children over the same age range. Diffusion tractography was used to delineate 10 major white matter tracts in each individual, and region-of-interest analysis was used to assess 4 deep gray matter structures. Fractional anisotropy, an indicator of white matter integrity, and mean diffusivity, a measure of the average water diffusion, were assessed in all 14 brain structures. Results: Diffusion tensor imaging revealed significant differences of diffusion parameters in several areas of the brain, including the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, cingulum, corticospinal tracts, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, globus pallidus, putamen, and thalamus. Reduced white and gray matter volumes, as well as total brain volume, were observed in the FASD group. Conclusions: These results demonstrate diffusion abnormalities in FASD beyond the corpus callosum and suggest that several specific white matter regions, particularly commissural and temporal connections, and deep gray matter areas of the brain are sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Maternal drinking during pregnancy can lead to a range of deleterious outcomes in the developing offspring that have been collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). There is interest and recognized value in using non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to characterize, respectively, structural and biochemical alterations in individuals with FASDs. To date, however, results with MRS have been inconsistent regarding the degree and/or nature of abnormalities. Methods: High-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) proton (1H) MRS is an ex vivo neuroimaging technique that can acquire spectra in small punches of intact tissue, providing clinically relevant neurochemical information about discrete brain regions. In this study, HR-MAS 1H MRS was used to examine regional neurochemistry in frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum of young rats previously exposed to ethanol as neonates. Key neurochemicals of interest included N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glutamate, GABA, glutamine, creatine, choline and myo-inositol. Results: Daily neonatal alcohol exposure from postnatal day 4 (PN4) through PN9 significantly reduced levels of NAA and taurine in the cerebellum and striatum, and induced sex-dependent reductions in cerebellar glutamate when measured on PN16. In addition, myo-inositol was significantly increased in cerebellum. The frontal cortex and hippocampus were virtually unaffected by this neonatal alcohol exposure. Conclusion: Results of this research may have implications for understanding the underlying neurobiology associated with FASDs and aid in testing treatments in the future. Ongoing studies are assessing the developmental persistence of and/or maturational recovery from these changes. Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - A diagnostically promising technique for tallying nominal reference errors in the narratives of school-aged children with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)
A1  - Thorne J.C.
A1  - Coggins T.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background: Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) include the range of disabilities that occur in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy, with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) on the severe end of the spectrum. Clinical research has documented a range of cognitive, social, and communication deficits in FASD and it indicates the need for diagnostic tools that can identify children with diminished communicative capacities resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Previous research indicates that analysis of nominal reference errors within narrative discourse may provide such a tool. Aims: To demonstrate the potential diagnostic utility of a new tool for tallying nominal reference errors in the oral narratives of school-aged children with FASD by presenting quantitative measurement data that address interrater agreement and predictive accuracy. Methods and Procedures: Retrospective analysis was conducted on spontaneously produced oral narratives from 32 school-aged children (8;5-11;7) with a range of socio-economic and ethnic profiles. Sixteen of the children had been previously diagnosis with an FASD, including five with full or partial FAS (pFAS). The remaining 16 children were considered typically developing (TD). A range of methods for calculating the rate of nominal reference errors (rNRE) were used to predict which narratives were produced by children from each group. Accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) for two predictions (FASD versus TD, and FAS/pFAS versus all others) was quantified using receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses. Pairwise statistical comparisons were made between methods to determine which had the most diagnostic potential. Outcomes and Results: The proposed system for calculating the rNRE was highly accurate at predicting which narratives were produced by children with FASD (versus TD, 88% overall accuracy), and which were produced by children with FAS/pFAS (versus all others, 97% overall accuracy), and outperformed all other methods tested. Agreement on coding decisions between independent judges was high (kappa=0.90). Conclusions: The strong predictive accuracy demonstrated in this study provides empirical evidence that the system proposed in this feasibility study has sufficient sensitivity and diagnostic utility to warrant further development for use with children suspected of prenatal alcohol exposure. It also points to the potential for the tool to be used with other clinical populations that, even in the absence of a confirmed alcohol exposure, share many of the communication challenges of this complex clinical population. © 2008 Royal College of Speech & Language Therapists.

T1  - Peptidergic agonists of activity-dependent neurotrophic factor protect against prenatal alcohol-induced neural tube defects and serotonin neuron loss

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure via maternal liquid diet consumption by C57BL/6 (B6) mice causes conspicuous midline neural tube deficit (dysraphia) and disruption of genesis and development of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the raphe nuclei, together with brain growth retardation. The current study tested the hypothesis that concurrent treatment with either an activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) agonist peptide [SALLRSIPA, (SAL)] or an activity-dependent neurotrophic protein (ADNP) agonist peptide [NAPVSIPQ, (NAP)] would protect against these alcohol-induced deficits in brain development. Methods: Timed-pregnant B6 dams consumed alcohol from embryonic day 7 (E7, before the onset of neurulation) until E15. Fetuses were obtained on E15 and brain sections processed for 5-HT immunocytochemistry, for evaluation of morphologic development of the brainstem raphe and its 5-HT neurons. Additional groups were treated either with SAL or NAP daily from E7 to E15 to assess the potential protective effects of these peptides. Measures of incomplete occlusion of the ventral canal and the frequency and extent of the openings in the rhombencephalon were obtained to assess fetal dysraphia. Counts of 5-HT-immunostained neurons were also obtained in the rostral and caudal raphe. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in abnormal openings along the midline and delayed closure of ventral canal in the brainstem. This dysraphia was associated with reductions in the number of 5-HT neurons both in the rostral raphe nuclei (that gives rise to ascending 5-HT projections) and in the caudal raphe (that gives rise to the descending 5-HT projections). Concurrent treatment of the alcohol-consuming dams with SAL prevented dysraphia and protected against the alcohol-induced reductions in 5-HT neurons in both the rostral and caudal raphe. NAP was less effective in protecting against dysraphia and did not protect against 5-HT loss in the rostral raphe, but did protect against loss in the caudal raphe. Conclusions: These findings further support the potential usefulness of these peptides for therapeutic interventions in pregnancies at risk for alcohol-induced developmental deficits. Notably, the ascending 5-HT projections of the rostral raphe have profound effects in regulating forebrain development and function, and the descending 5-HT projections of the caudal raphe are critical for regulating respiration. Protection of the rostral 5-HT-system may help prevent structural and functional deficits linked to abnormal forebrain development, and protection of the caudal systems may also reduce the increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have documented impairments in executive functioning (EF). One component of EF, concept formation, has not been well studied in this group. Methods: Children (8 to 18 years) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with and without fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), were compared to typically developing controls on 2 measures of concept formation and conceptual set shifting: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the Card Sorting Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System. In addition to between-group comparisons, performance relative to overall intellectual functioning was examined. Results: Children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure showed impairment on both tests of concept formation compared to non-exposed controls. These deficits included difficulty generating and verbalizing concepts, increased error rates and perseverative responses, and poorer response to feedback. However, in comparison to controls, alcohol-exposed children performed better on measures of concept formation than predicted by their overall IQ scores. Exploratory analyses suggest that this may be due to differences in how the measures relate at different IQ levels and may not be specific to prenatal alcohol exposure. Conclusions: Deficits in concept formation and conceptual set shifting were observed in alcohol-exposed children with or without the diagnosis of FAS and in the absence of mental retardation. These deficits likely impact problem solving skills and adaptive functioning and have implications for therapeutic interventions in this population.

T1  - Biomarkers for detection of prenatal alcohol exposure: A critical review of fatty acid ethyl esters in meconium
A1  - Burd L.
A1  - Hofer R.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was a review of published studies utilizing measurement of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) in meconium as biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: We completed a literature search of PubMed using the terms meconium, fatty acid ethyl esters, biomarkers, and prenatal alcohol exposure. We included only peer reviewed studies utilizing analysis of meconium for the presence of FAEE in humans through the year 2007. RESULTS: We found 10 articles reporting on original research examining the relationship of FAEE from meconium and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The 10 articles used six different PAE assessment strategies and four different analytical techniques for determining FAEE endpoints. The articles included 2,221 subjects (range 4 to 725) with 455 (20.5%) subjects identified as exposed using the methods stated in the articles. FAEE levels above the studies' respective cutoffs were reported for 502 (22.6%) subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The accurate identification of alcohol-exposed pregnancies represents a significant challenge in the development of FAEE detection cutoffs to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the test. We present several options for the improvement of exposure assessment in future studies of FAEE as biomarkers for PAE. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - The aim of this study was to describe the 'lived' experiences of New Zealand birth mothers, from pregnancy onwards, of a child/ren diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Method: A qualitative paradigm was utilized so that the participants could tell their stories through words and text rather than collecting statistical data which is the domain of quantitative research. The adoption of a feminist standpoint theory bridged a communication gap, adjusted the balance of power within society and gave visibility and voice to the women. Eight New Zealand-resident multipara biological mothers ages 18 and over, who had nurtured or were still living with their affected offspring, were studied. Their ages ranged from 29 to 64. The mothers were interviewed in depth, face-to-face, using unstructured, open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Results: The mothers described a range of issues of concern for their disabled offspring and themselves (as advocates) relating to health, social, educational, judicial systems, lack of knowledge by professionals and problems in diagnosis, to being oppressed and stigmatized. Cognitive concerns for the offspring included attention-deficit, absence of fear, diminished memory and comprehension and inability to acknowledge and understand consequences. Behavioural issues included excessive crying or no crying as a baby, lying, stealing, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, destructiveness, sexual promiscuity and few friends. Other issues of concern were delayed milestones and numerous health problems. All mothers stated that the pregnancy, labour and delivery of their child with FASD were different from their other non-compromised pregnancies/labours/deliveries. Most mothers said that the doctors used medical language which they did not understand, thus giving power to the former. Seven mothers were either married to or partners of alcoholics when they conceived their offspring with FASD. All mothers had been drinking alcohol before becoming pregnant. Six mothers came from drinking families. Most mothers continued to consume alcohol because they did not know that they had conceived. All mothers were unaware of FASD and its effects on the unborn child. Eight babies had low Apgar scores with an average of 6 (out of 10) and low birth weight (average 6lb 2oz). An Apgar score is a numerical expression of an infant's condition, usually determined at 60 seconds after birth, based on heart rate, respiratory efforts, muscle tone, reflex irritability and colour. All women were of middle to high socio-economic status. Seven mothers experienced family breakdown as a result of alcohol consumption by the biological father of the child with FASD. All women feared for their child's future. Conclusion: Health, social, educational, judicial professionals, policy-makers and agencies, need to understand and be educated in the daily realities and complex problems that children with FASD and their families face. Only then will the correct diagnosis be made so that these individuals can receive the nurturing, needs, education, funding and support they require in order to live full and meaningful lives and have the quality of life they deserve. ©2008 Canadian Society for Clinical Pharmacology.

N2  - New draft alcohol guidelines for Australia state that, for pregnant women and women planning pregnancy, 'no drinking is the safest option'. One of the best known adverse effects of alcohol exposure on the fetus is the fetal alcohol syndrome. Others include alcohol-related birth defects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders and increased risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth and low birthweight. Over half of Australian women consume alcohol during pregnancy. Obstetricians have a pivotal role in advising women of the effects of alcohol on the fetus and reducing fetal exposure. © 2008 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been identified as a major cause of impairment to normal physical and intellectual development among Indigenous children in Far North Queensland; however, little is known of the pregnancy characteristics of mothers of those children diagnosed with FAS or of interventions that might assist in lowering the prevalence of the syndrome. Aim: To review the pregnancy records of women whose infants were subsequently diagnosed with FAS by the Paediatric Outreach Service (POS) of the Cairns Base Hospital, and to determine how such women might be identified prospectively in pregnancy and offered intervention to reduce alcohol consumption. Methods: A retrospective case-control study involving all children diagnosed with FAS by the POS between 1994 and 2006; maternal pregnancy records were accessed and details obtained. Results: Mothers of cases were older, of higher parity, smoked more cigarettes, attended fewer antenatal visits and experienced more antenatal and delivery complications than mothers of controls. The average gestational age at booking was not statistically significant between the two groups. There was a significant difference between the two groups in self-reported alcohol consumption both before and during pregnancy and in numbers of women who decreased alcohol consumption once the diagnosis of pregnancy was known to them. Conclusions: There is the potential to identify prospectively women presenting for antenatal care who are heavy drinkers and risk FAS in their infants, using the self-reported information about alcohol intake already being collected by our service; such women may then be offered specific interventions to try to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnancy. © 2008 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), a severe consequence of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, is associated with craniofacial defects, mental retardation, and stunted growth. Previous studies in C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice provide evidence that alcohol-induced pathogenesis follows early changes in gene expression within specific molecular pathways in the embryonic headfold. Whereas the former (B6J) pregnancies carry a high-risk for dysmorphogenesis following maternal exposure to 2.9 g/kg alcohol (two injections spaced 4.0 h apart on gestation day 8), the latter (B6N) pregnancies carry a low-risk for malformations. The present study used this murine model to screen amniotic fluid for biomarkers that could potentially discriminate between FAS-positive and FAS-negative pregnancies. METHODS: B6J and B6N litters were treated with alcohol (exposed) or saline (control) on day 8 of gestation. Amniotic fluid aspirated on day 17 (n = 6 replicate litters per group) was subjected to trypsin digestion for analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry with the aid of denoising algorithms, statistical testing, and classification methods. RESULTS: We identified several peaks in the proteomics screen that were reduced consistently and specifically in exposed B6J litters. Preliminary characterization by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and multidimensional protein identification mapped the reduced peaks to alpha fetoprotein (AFP). The predictive strength of AFP deficiency as a biomarker for FAS-positive litters was confirmed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSIONS: These findings in genetically susceptible mice support clinical observations in maternal serum that implicate a decrease in AFP levels following prenatal alcohol damage. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is one of the most common preventable causes of developmental disability and is currently one of the most pressing public health concerns in Canada. FASD refers to the range of physical, mental, behavioural and learning disabilities that an individual may acquire as a result of maternal alcohol consumption. Prenatal exposure to alcohol leads to numerous primary and secondary disabilities in affected children, which can result in poot long-term outcomes. The present paper reviews previous research on the neurobehavioural outcomes of children with FASD, particularly in terms of behavioural, mental health and adaptive outcomes. The role of risk and protective factors on these outcomes and the impact of FASD on the family are also examined. Finally, future directions and implications regarding outcomes research among children with FASD, particularly within a Canadian context, are discussed. ©2008 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing kidneys
A1  - Assadi F.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Objective: Clinical and experimental studies strongly suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with zinc deficiency and impaired renal tubular function. Whether material alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes renal tubular cell injury is unknown. Material & Methods: Renal function was studied in 8 infants with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 8 healthy age-matched infants. Renal function and structure were also examined in 11 offspring of rats exposed to alcohol during gestation. Findings: Infants with FAS had limited ability to concentrate urine after water restriction (P<0.001) and impaired acidification after acute acid loading (P<0.001) compared to control group. Plasma zinc levels were lower (P<0.001) and urinary zinc excretion was higher (P<0.001) in infants with FAS compared to control infants. Scanning electron microscopic studies revealed cytoplasmic mitochondrial hypertrophy and vacuolar structures of the epithelial cells of the cortical collecting ducts in the rat kidney following fetal exposure to alcohol. Conclusion: These findings suggest that offspring of rats exposed to alcohol during fetal life have renal functional and structure abnormalities that may be responsible in the genesis of renal functional abnormalities as described in infacts with FAS.

N2  - Objective: To determine the association of maternal CYP17 gene polymorphisms and prenatal alcohol consumption with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Study design: A case-control study in singleton livebirths was conducted at the Liverpool Women's Hospital between 2004 and 2005. Cases (n = 90) were mothers with an IUGR baby and controls (n = 180) those with a normal birthweight infant. Maternal genomic DNA was extracted from buccal smears and PCR (RFLP) was used for genotyping. Results: Amongst cases, the prevalence of the maternal CYP17 homozygous wild type "A1A1", heterozygous "A1A2" and homozygous "A2A2" variants was 36.7%, 47.7% and 15.6%, which did not differ significantly from their prevalence amongst controls (p = 0.6). The proportion with prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly higher in cases than controls (45.6% versus 30.6%, p = 0.01). Mean birthweight was significantly lower in mothers with the CYP17 A1A1 genotype compared to those with variant genotypes (A1A2/A2A2) in both the alcohol-exposed (p = 0.03) and non-exposed groups (p = 0.01). In all women regardless of genotype, IUGR risk increased in mothers exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (OR, 2.9, 95% CI; 1.8-4.2, p = 0.01). There was a significant interaction between the CYP17 A1A1 genotype and prenatal alcohol consumption for fetal growth restriction (adjusted OR, 1.4, 95% CI; 1.1-1.9, p = 0.04). Conclusion: The association between prenatal alcohol exposure and intrauterine fetal growth restriction was modulated by the maternal CYP17 A1A1 genotype. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: Although it is well known that France has a cultural history of alcohol use, no recent French data on alcohol consumption during pregnancy in a large sample are available. Methods: To determine the alcohol consumption patterns among pregnant women in France, we analyzed data from a 1-year multicenter self-survey. Sociodemographic profile, obstetrical history, neonatal data, and a self-report for assessing drinking patterns during pregnancy including AUDIT were recorded from women who delivered recently. Cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were also reported. Results: A total of 837 pregnant women have described all parameters. The mean age at delivery of our sample was 29.7 years (SD = 4.8 years). A total of 52.2% of women indicated that they had consumed alcohol at least once during their pregnancy, and among abstainers 54.5% had a positive AUDIT score. Of the pregnant women who consumed alcohol, 13.7% reported at least one binge drinking episode (5 or more drinks on 1 occasion) during pregnancy. Binge drinking is significantly more frequent than regular alcohol consumption (at least 1 drink more than 1 time per week) during pregnancy. A prevalence rate of FAS of 1.8 per 1,000 live births was observed. Conclusions: There is a large population of women who still drink alcohol during pregnancy, particularly in binge drinking episodes. This underlines the need to clearly inform women of childbearing age about the dangers of alcohol during pregnancy as related to all types of consumption. Moreover, acting to prevent alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy may also greatly influence prenatal drinking. Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objectives: This is a third exploration of risk factors for the two most severe forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and Partial FAS (PFAS), in a South African community with the highest reported prevalence of FAS in the world. Methods: In a case control design, interview and collateral data concerning mothers of 72 first grade children with FAS or PFAS are compared with 134 randomly selected maternal controls of children from the same schools. Results: Significant differences were found between the mothers of FASD children and controls in socio-economic status, educational attainment, and a higher prevalence of FASD among rural residents. The birth order of the index children, gravidity, and still birth were significantly higher among mothers of FASD children. Mothers of children with a FASD are less likely to be married and more likely to have a male partner who drank during the index pregnancy. Current and gestational alcohol use by mothers of FASD children is bingeing on weekends, with no reduction in drinking reported in any trimester in 75 to 90% of the pregnancies that resulted in an FAS child or during 50 to 87% of PFAS-producing pregnancies. There was significantly less drinking among the controls in the second and third trimesters (11 to 14%). Estimated peak blood alcohol concentrations (BAC)s of the mothers of PFAS children range from 0.155 in the first trimester to 0.102 in the third, and for mothers of FAS children the range is from 0.197 to 0.200 to 0.191 in the first, second, and third. Smoking percentage during pregnancy was significantly higher for mothers of FASD children (82 to 84%) than controls (35%); but average quantity smoked is low in the 3 groups at 30 to 41 cigarettes per week. A relatively young average age of the mother at the time of FAS and PFAS births (28.8 and 24.8 years respectively) is not explained by early onset of regular drinking (mean = 20.3 to 20.5 years of age). But the mean years of alcohol consumption is different between groups, 16.3, 10.7, and 12.1 years respectively for mothers of FAS, FASD, and drinking controls. Mothers of FAS and PFAS children were significantly smaller in height and weight than controls at time of interview. The child's total dysmorphology score correlates significantly with mother's weight (-0.46) and BMI (-0.39). Bivariate correlations are significant between the child's dysmorphology and known independent demographic and behavioral maternal risk factors for FASD: higher gravidity and parity; lower education and income; rural residence; drinks consumed daily, weekly, and bingeing during pregnancy; drinking in all trimesters; partner's alcohol consumption during pregnancy; and use of tobacco during pregnancy. Similar significant correlations were also found for most of the above independent maternal risk variables and the child's verbal IQ, non-verbal IQ and behavioral problems. Conclusions: Maternal data in this population are generally consistent with a spectrum of effects exhibited in the children. Variation within the spectrum links greater alcohol doses with a greater severity of effects among children of older and smaller mothers of lower socio economic status in their later pregnancies. Prevention is needed to address known maternal risk factors for FASD in this population. Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Determination of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair: A promising way for retrospective detection of alcohol abuse during pregnancy?

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The retrospective detection of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is an important part of the diagnosis of the fetal alcohol syndrome. A promising way to solve this problem can be the determination of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) or/and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair of the mothers. In this article, the present state in analytical determination and interpretation of FAEE and EtG concentrations in hair are reviewed. Both FAEE and EtG are minor metabolites of ethanol and as direct alcohol markers very specific for alcohol. They are durably deposited in hair, which enables taking advantage of the long diagnostic time window of this sample material. In the last years, specific and sensitive methods for determination of both alcohol markers in hair were developed. Headspace solid phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy after hair extraction with an n-heptane/dimethylsulfoxide mixture proved to be a favorable technique for determination of four characteristic FAEE (ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate). EtG is extracted from hair by water and analyzed either by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy with negative chemical ionization after cleanup with solid phase extraction and derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride or by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy. The detection limits of the single FAEE as well as of EtG are in the range of 1 to 10 pg/mg. FAEE as well as EtG were determined in a larger number of hair samples of teetotalers, social drinkers, patients in alcohol withdrawal treatment, and death cases with previous known heavy drinking. From the results, the following criteria were derived: strict abstinence is excluded or improbable at CFAEE >0.2 ng/mg or CEtG >7 pg/mg. Moderate social drinkers should have CFAEE <0.5 ng/mg and CEtG <25 pg/mg; above these values, alcohol abuse is probable. Until now, there has been no evaluation in context of FAS diagnosis; however, a successful application for this purpose can be expected from the good experience in driving ability examination. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol has adverse effects on offspring neuroendocrine and behavioural functions. Alcohol readily crosses the placenta, thus directly affecting developing foetal endocrine organs. In addition, alcohol-induced changes in maternal endocrine function can disrupt the normal hormonal interactions between the pregnant female and foetal systems, altering the normal hormone balance and, indirectly, affecting the development of foetal metabolic, physiological and endocrine functions. The present review focuses on the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on offspring neuroendocrine function, with particular emphasis on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a key player in the stress response. The HPA axis is highly susceptible to programming during foetal and neonatal development. Here, we review data demonstrating that alcohol exposure in utero programmes the foetal HPA axis such that HPA tone is increased throughout life. Importantly, we show that, although alterations in HPA responsiveness and regulation are robust phenomena, occurring in both male and female offspring, sexually dimorphic effects of alcohol are frequently observed. We present updated findings on possible mechanisms underlying differential effects of alcohol on male and female offspring, with special emphasis on effects at different levels of the HPA axis, and on modulatory influences of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormones and serotonin. Finally, possible mechanisms underlying foetal programming of the HPA axis, and the long-term implications of increased exposure to endogenous glucocorticoids for offspring vulnerability to illnesses or disorders later in life are discussed. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.

N2  - Background: Although epidemiological data indicate that White women are more likely to drink and binge drink before pregnancy, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is more common in the Black population than among Whites in the United States. Differences in drinking cessation between Black and White women who become pregnant may help explain the disparity in FAS rates. Methods: The study sample was comprised of 280,126 non-Hispanic Black and White women, ages 18 to 44, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2001 to 2005 data sets. Predictors of reduction in alcohol consumption (in drinks per month) and binge drinking (>4 drinks on one occasion) by pregnant and non-pregnant women were identified with logistic regression. The effect of interactions of pregnancy status with age, education, and Black or White race on drinks per month and binge occasions were explored using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Pregnant White women averaged 79.5% fewer drinks per month than non-pregnant White women (F = 1250.1, p < 0.001), and 85.4% fewer binge drinking occasions (F = 376, p < 0.001). Pregnant Black women averaged 58.2% fewer drinks per month than non-pregnant Black women (F = 31.8, p < 0.001) and 64.0% fewer binge occasions (F = 13.8, p < 0.001). Compared to Black women, White women appear to make a 38% greater reduction in drinks per month, and a 33% greater reduction in binge occasions. Conclusions: Non-Hispanic White women appear more likely to reduce drinks per month and binge drinking occasions than non-Hispanic Black women during pregnancy. These findings may help explain disparities in FAS in the United States, though this cross-sectional sample does not permit claims of causation. To better describe the impact of differential drinking reduction on FAS rates, future studies of longitudinal data should be done. © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Brain structural abnormalities and neurocognitive dysfunction have been observed in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Little is known about how white matter integrity is related to these functional and morphological deficits. We used a combination of diffusion tensor and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate white matter integrity in individuals with FASDs and related these findings to neurocognitive deficits. Seventeen children and adolescents with FASDs were compared with 19 typically developing age-and gender-matched controls. Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) was observed in individuals with FASDs relative to controls in the right lateral temporal lobe and bilaterally in the lateral aspects of the splenium of the corpus callosum. White matter density was also lower in some, but not all regions in which FA was lower. FA abnormalities were confirmed to be in areas of white matter in post hoc region of interest analyses, further supporting that less myelin or disorganized fiber tracts are associated with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Significant correlations between performance on a test of visuomotor integration and FA in bilateral splenium, but not temporal regions were observed within the FASD group. Correlations between the visuomotor task and FA within the splenium were not significant within the control group, and were not significant for measures of reading ability. This suggests that this region of white matter is particularly susceptible to damage from prenatal alcohol exposure and that disruption of splenial fibers in this group is associated with poorer visuomotor integration.

N2  - Background: Ethanol (ETOH) consumption by pregnant women can result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). To date, the cellular targets and mechanisms responsible for FASD are not fully characterized. Our aim was to determine if ETOH can affect fetal human brain-derived neural progenitor cells (NPC). Methods: Neural progenitor cells were isolated by positive selection from normal second trimester fetal human brains (n = 4) and cultured, for up to 72 hours, in mitogenic media containing 0, 1, 10, or 100 mM ETOH. From 48 to 72 hours in culture, neurospheres generated in these conditions were filmed using time-lapse video microscopy. At the end of 72 hours, neurosphere diameter and roundness were measured using videographic software. Mitotic phase analysis of cell-cycle activity and apoptotic cell count were also performed at this time, by flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Real-time PCR was used to estimate expression of genes associated with cell adhesion pathways. Results: Neurosphere diameter correlated positively (r = 0.87) with increasing ETOH concentrations. There was no significant difference in cell-cycle activity and no significant increase in apoptosis with increasing ETOH concentrations. Time-lapse video microscopy showed that ETOH (100 mM) reduced the time for neurosphere coalescence. Real-time PCR analysis showed that ETOH significantly altered the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion. There was an increase in the expression of alpha and beta Laminins 1, beta Integrins 3 and 5, Secreted phosphoprotein1 and Sarcoglycan . No change in the expression of beta Actin was observed while the expression of beta Integrin 2 was significantly suppressed. Conclusions: ETOH had no effect on NPC apoptosis but, resulted in more rapid coalescence and increased volume of neurospheres. Additionally, the expression of genes associated with cell adhesion was significantly altered. ETOH induced changes in NPC surface adhesion interactions may underlie aspects of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in FASD. © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: A length polymorphism in the serotonin (5-HT) transporter gene promoter region in humans and rhesus monkeys affects functional characteristics of the brain 5-HT system. Prenatal alcohol exposure (FA-exposure) can have an impact on brain and psychosocial development that could interact with genetic endowment. This study determined whether moderate FA-exposure interacts with polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter gene to increase the incidence or severity of fetal alcohol effects in rhesus monkeys. Methods: The offspring of monkeys who did or did not consume moderate amounts of alcohol during pregnancy were assessed for temperament as neonates and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) in response to mother-infant separation at 6 months of age. Serotonin promoter region genotypes (homozygous s/s or heterozygous s/l versus homozygous l/l) were determined. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposed carriers of the s allele exhibited increased neonatal irritability and increased ACTH and CORT compared with FA-exposed monkeys homozygous for the l allele and monkeys that were not FA-exposed regardless of genotype. Conclusions: The s allele of the 5-HT transporter increases the probability of neonatal irritability and increased stress responsiveness in FA-exposed monkeys, and this gene-environment interaction may affect psychosocial development. It is probable that FA-exposure contributes to 5-HT transporter gene-environment interactions in humans. © 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Children with either fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) display deficits in attention and executive function (EF) and differential diagnosis of these two clinical groups may be difficult, especially when information about prenatal alcohol exposure is unavailable. The current study compared EF performance of three groups: children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC); nonexposed children with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); and typically developing controls (CON). Both clinical groups met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The EF tasks used were the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Results indicated different patterns of deficit; both clinical groups displayed deficits on the WCST and a relative weakness on letter versus category fluency. Only the ALC group displayed overall deficits on letter fluency and a relative weakness on TMT-B versus TMT-A. In addition, WCST performance was significantly lower than expected based on IQ in the ADHD group and significantly higher than expected in the ALC group. These results, which indicate that, although EF deficits occurred in both clinical groups, the degree and pattern of deficit differed between the ALC and ADHD groups, may improve differential diagnosis. © 2008 The International Neuropsychological Society.

T1  - Novel role of adrenergic neurons in the brain stem in mediating the hypothalamic-pituitary axis hyperactivity caused by prenatal alcohol exposure

N2  - Exposure to alcohol during embryonic development leads to changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis such that adult offspring release more adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) than controls when exposed to stress. In the present work, we tested the hypothesis that changes in the activity of the catecholaminergic system modulate, at least in part, this upregulation of the HPA axis. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to alcohol 6 h daily during gestation days 7-18 using the vapor chamber model, which generated mean blood alcohol levels of 188.6+/-10 mg/dl. All experiments were performed on 2 to 3-month-old offspring. We first measured the ACTH response to i.c.v. injection of adrenergic receptor agonists. In rats exposed to footshocks, we then investigated the activity of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) as well as indexes of catecholamine ir, namely tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunopositive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), TH immunopositive neurons in the locus coeruleus, and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) immunopositive neurons in the brain stem. While adult females exposed to alcohol during fetal development (FAE) displayed the expected enhanced ACTH response to stress, there were no significant differences in response to adrenergic receptor agonists or in shock-induced CRF/TH ir and neuronal activity, as determined by c-fos colocalization. In contrast, FAE female offspring exposed to footshocks showed a significant increase in the activity of adrenergic neurons in the C1 region of the brain stem, a population of cells that project to the PVN. Collectively, these results suggest that while FAE-induced hyperactivity of the HPA axis is not accompanied by significant changes in PVN CRF or TH-ir neurons, it is characterized by an upregulation of C1 adrenergic neurons of the brain stem. This novel finding should lead to the functional characterization of this brain region in the FAE model. © 2008 IBRO.

T1  - Perinatal alcohol exposure leads to prolonged upregulation of hypothalamic GABAA receptors and increases behavioral sensitivity to gaboxadol
A1  - Volgin D.V.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) is associated with lasting abnormalities of sleep and motor development, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that AE alters development of GABAergic signaling in the hypothalamic regions important for the control of sleep and motor activity. Alcohol (5.25 g/(kg day)) was administered intragastrically to male rats on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to the human third trimester (AE group). Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). Motor activity was monitored on PD27 and 28. On PD29 and 30, GABAA receptor subunit mRNA levels and alpha4 and delta subunit proteins were quantified by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively, in the wake- and motor activity-promoting perifornical (PF) region of the posterior hypothalamus and the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) region of the anterior hypothalamus. Then, in 47-52-day-old rats, motor activity was quantified following administration of GABAA receptor agonist, gaboxadol (5 mg/kg s.c.). In the PF region, mRNA and protein levels for the alpha4 and delta subunits were significantly higher and beta3 and 2 subunit mRNAs were also increased in the AE group. In the VLPO region, only the delta subunit mRNA was increased. Spontaneous motor activity was lower and suppressed more by gaboxadol in the AE than S group, and the latency to a transient total loss of activity after gaboxadol was shorter in the AE group. Thus, perinatal AE leads to GABAA receptor overexpression in the vigilance- and motor activity-promoting hypothalamic PF region, with the neurochemical and functional outcomes lasting long beyond the period of the insult. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Alcohol exposure during the first two trimesters-equivalent alters the development of corpus callosum projection neurons in the rat

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Children exposed prenatally to alcohol can display a variety of neural deficits, including an altered development of the corpus callosum (CC), the largest interhemispheric axon pathway in the brain. Furthermore, these children show functional abnormalities that are related to brain regions with significant numbers of CC connections. Little is known about how alcohol imparts influence on CC development, but one possible mechanism is by affecting the corpus callosum projection neurons (CCpn) directly. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the number, size, and distribution of CCpn within the visual cortex. The visual cortex was selected specifically due to the many vision-related deficits noted in fetal alcohol exposed children and because the critical role of the CC in visual cortex development is well documented. Sprague-Dawley rat pups received one of four alcohol dosages during gestational days (G) 1-20, or reared as nutritional or untreated control animals. Each litter was categorized according to the peak blood alcohol concentration experienced. Pups were removed from each litter on days equivalent to G29, G36, G43, and G50, for histology and measurement. Callosal axons were labeled retrogradely to their CCpn using 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) and the CCpn were then examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Differences between alcohol-exposed and control animals were observed in CCpn cell body size, number, and location with the cortex. This was particularly true of animals exposed to high doses of alcohol. In addition, some trends of CCpn development were found to be unchanged as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure. The results demonstrate clear differences in the development of CCpn in the visual cortex between alcohol-exposed and control animals and suggest that this development is particularly affected in those animals exposed to high doses of alcohol. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Infants exposed prenatally to alcohol are at increased risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Aim: To examine the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure, sleep, arousal and sleep-related spontaneous motor movements in early infancy. Study design: Low-income women (N = 13) were interviewed regarding pre- and pregnancy rates of alcohol, cigarette smoking and other substance use in the perinatal period. Infants were examined in a laboratory nap study using EEG, videography and actigraphy at 6-8 weeks of age. Estimates of maternal pre- and pregnancy alcohol use were used to divide infants into high vs. low maternal alcohol use groups. Subjects: Mother-infant dyads recruited from a family practice clinic. Outcome measures: Sleep-related spontaneous movements, behavioral state, and maternal assessments of infant alertness and irritability. Results: Pre-pregnancy rates of alcohol consumption including binge drinking correlated with maternal report of poor infant alertness, and increased irritability. High maternal exposure groups showed increased sleep fragmentation, e.g. frequency and duration of wakefulness following sleep onset and decreased active sleep. Bout analysis of the temporal structure of sleep-related spontaneous movements showed significantly reduced bout duration associated with high maternal alcohol use. Conclusion: These results present evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts postnatal sleep organization and suppresses spontaneous movements during sleep, and increased sleep fragmentation promotes sleep deprivation. Results are consistent with the SIDS model of chronic sleep debt and suggest that attenuated sleep-related movements should be examined as an important modulator of cardiorespiratory functions during sleep in high-risk groups. © 2008.

N2  - Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) have shown regional patterns of dysmorphology, most prominent in parietal and posterior temporal cortices. Various methods of image analysis have been employed in these studies, but abnormalities in cortical thickness have not yet been mapped over the entire cortical surface in individuals with FASD. Further, relationships between cognitive dysfunction and cortical thickness measures have not yet been explored. We applied cortical pattern matching algorithms and techniques for measuring cortical thickness in millimeters to the structural brain MRI images of 21 subjects with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (8-22 years, mean age 12.6 years), and 21 normally developing control subjects (8-25 years, mean age 13.5 years). Dissociable cognitive measures, of verbal recall and visuospatial functioning, were correlated with cortical thickness, and group by test score interactions were evaluated for predicting cortical thickness. Significant cortical thickness excesses of up to 1.2 mm were observed in the FASD subjects in large areas of bilateral temporal, bilateral inferior parietal, and right frontal regions. Significant group by test score interactions were found in right dorsal frontal regions for the verbal recall measure and in left occipital regions for the visuospatial measure. These results are consistent with earlier analyses from our own and other research groups, but for the first time, we show that cortical thickness is also increased in right lateral frontal regions in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Further, the significant interactions show for the first time that brain-behavior relationships are altered as a function of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. © The Author 2007.
