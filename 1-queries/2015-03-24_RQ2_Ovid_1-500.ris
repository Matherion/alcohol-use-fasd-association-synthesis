N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a complex malformative condition due to the teratogenic effect of alcohol consumed during pregnancy. Several epidemiological studies have shown that maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is the most common preventable cause of mental retardation in childhood. The effects of alcohol on the fetus range from abortion to a spectrum of clinical manifestations called FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders) that include partial FAS (PFAS), neonatal alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (ARND) up to the most severe disease defined as FAS.

N2  - Objectives Classical eyeblink conditioning (EBC), an elemental form of learning, is among the most sensitive indicators of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The cerebellum plays a key role in maintaining timed movements with millisecond accuracy required for EBC. Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to identify cerebellar regions that mediate timing in healthy controls and the degree to which these areas are also recruited in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Experimental design fMRI data were acquired during an auditory rhythmic/non-rhythmic finger tapping task. We present results for 17 children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS, 17 heavily exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children and 16 non- or minimally exposed controls. Principal observations Controls showed greater cerebellar blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation in right crus I, vermis IV-VI, and right lobule VI during rhythmic than non-rhythmic finger tapping. The alcohol-exposed children showed smaller activation increases during rhythmic tapping in right crus I than the control children and the most severely affected children with either FAS or PFAS showed smaller increases in vermis IV-V. Higher levels of maternal alcohol intake per occasion during pregnancy were associated with reduced activation increases during rhythmic tapping in all four regions associated with rhythmic tapping in controls. Conclusions The four cerebellar areas activated by the controls more during rhythmic than non-rhythmic tapping have been implicated in the production of timed responses in several previous studies. These data provide evidence linking binge-like drinking during pregnancy to poorer function in cerebellar regions involved in timing and somatosensory processing needed for complex tasks requiring precise timing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Risky drinking among Russian women constitutes a significant risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP). Russian women report that obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physicians are the most important source of information about alcohol consumption during pregnancy and developing effective prevention interventions by OB/GYNs is indicated. This is the first study focused on implementation of an AEP prevention intervention at women's clinics in Russia., METHOD: The paper describes the intervention protocol and addresses questions about the feasibility of a brief FASD prevention intervention delivered by OB/GYNs at women's clinics in Russia. Brief physician intervention guidelines and two evidence-based FASD prevention interventions were utilized to design a brief dual-focused physician intervention (DFBPI) appropriate to Russian OB/GYN care. The questions answered were whether trained OB/GYN physicians could deliver DFBPI during women's routine clinic visits, whether they maintained skills over time in clinical settings, and which specific intervention components were better maintained. Data were collected as part of a larger study aimed at evaluating effectiveness of DFBPI in reducing AEP risk in non-pregnant women. Methods of monitoring the intervention delivery included fidelity check lists (FCL) with the key components of the intervention completed by physicians and patients and live and audio taped observations of intervention sessions. Physicians (N = 23) and women (N = 372) independently completed FCL, and 78 audiotapes were coded., RESULTS: The differences between women's and physicians' reports on individual items were not significant. Although the majority of physician and patient reports were consistent (N = 305), a discrepancy existed between the reports in 57 cases. Women reported more intervention components missing compared to physicians (p < 0.001). Discussing barriers was the most difficult component for physicians to implement, and OB/GYN demonstrated difficulties in discussing contraception methods., CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the feasibility of the DFBPI in Russia. OB/GYN physicians trained in the DFBPI, monitored, and supported were able to implement and maintain skills during the study. In addition to the alcohol focus, DFBPI training needs to have a sufficient component to improve physicians' skills in discussing contraception use.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and associated behavioral impairments that may be linked to disruptions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Social and physical enrichment has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach toward reversing behavioral deficits associated with FASD and is also a potent stimulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In the present study, we utilized a genetic fate mapping approach in nestin-CreER(T2)/YFP bitransgenic mice to identify the stage-specific impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on the stepwise maturation of adult hippocampal progenitors. Using a limited alcohol access "drinking-in-the-dark" model of FASD, we confirm previous findings that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure has no effect on adult neurogenesis under standard housing conditions, but abolishes the neurogenic response to enriched environment (EE). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this effect is primarily due to failed EE-mediated survival of postmitotic neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that the neurogenic deficit is associated with impaired spatial pattern recognition, as demonstrated by delayed learning of FASD-EE mice in an A-B contextual discrimination task. These results identify a potential maturational stage-specific mechanism(s) underlying impaired neurogenic function in a preclinical model of FASD, and provide a basis for testing regulatory pathways in this model through conditional and inducible manipulation of gene expression in the adult hippocampal progenitor population.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study assesses factors that contribute to alcohol consumption during pregnancy and identifies potential intervention strategies to reduce consumption., METHODS: The study sample includes 142 pregnant women who attended a public hospital for prenatal health care in Perth, Western Australia. All participants returned a self-completion survey., RESULTS: Women who discontinued drinking during pregnancy were significantly more likely to be engaged in full time home duties and had completed less formal education. Women who continued to drink were more likely to have drunk in previous pregnancies and during the preconception period. Nearly 40% of high risk women reported a negative comment in response to their drinking. One-third of women in the risky group were advised by a health professional not to drink alcohol. Women were most likely to drink in their own home or at the home of a friend., CONCLUSIONS: Participatory research with women who drink while pregnant can assist in identifying potential intervention strategies that have resonance with this group and therefore more potential for creating behaviour change. Implications. The World Health Organization recognises, and has done for over 10 years, that alcohol use during pregnancy which results in Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is the leading cause of environmental-related birth defects and mental retardation in the Western world.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to assess the rate of misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among a population of foster and adopted youth referred to a children's mental health center. METHODS: Data were collected from a sample of 547 children who underwent a comprehensive multidisciplinary diagnostic evaluation. Utilizing current diagnostic criteria, children were diagnosed, as appropriate, with fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, or alcohol-related birth defects. Changes in rates of alcohol exposure-related diagnoses and cooccurring mental health disorders pre- and postassessment were analyzed by using McNemar's test for dependent proportions. RESULTS: Among 156 children and adolescents who met criteria for a diagnosis within the fetal alcohol spectrum, 125 had never been diagnosed as affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, a missed diagnosis rate of 80.1%. Of the 31 who had been recognized before referral as affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, 10 children's FASD diagnoses were changed within the spectrum, representing a misdiagnosis rate of 6.4%. The remaining 21 (13.5%) children's diagnoses stayed the same. There also were significant changes in the rate of mental health diagnosis, and learning disorders, communication disorders, and intellectual disability, objective signs of neurocognitive damage, were not recognized in a significant number of children with FASD. CONCLUSIONS: Within this clinical sample, 86.5% of youth with FASD had never been previously diagnosed or had been misdiagnosed. These high rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis have significant implications for intervention and therapeutic services.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which may underlie some of the behavioral and adaptive problems seen in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol show altered basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond 2 years of age. It is also unknown if cortisol levels can be normalized through intervention programs. In this study, we investigated the effects of a physical activity program for children with FASD to determine: 1) if HPA dysregulation persists in school-age children with FASD, and 2) the effect of our program on cortisol levels. Twenty six children (ages 6-14 years) with FASD participated in an 8 week motor skill development program. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 24 children and compared at 4 time points: before, immediately after, 3 months, and 1 year after program completion. Cortisol levels were also compared to 32 control children to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: awakening, after school, and just before bedtime. Cortisol levels were significantly higher in the afternoon and at bedtime in children with FASD with confirmed prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol (alcohol exposure rank 4), compared with Control children or children with FASD with exposure to low or unknown levels of alcohol (alcohol exposure rank 3). The program did not significantly affect cortisol levels in children with FASD as a group. These results provide support for long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the HPA system in humans, which could increase vulnerability to mental health issues and diseases later in life.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the number one cause of preventable mental retardation. An estimated 2-5% of children are diagnosed as having a FASD. While it is known that children prenatally exposed to alcohol experience cognitive deficits and a higher incidence of psychiatric illness later in life, the pathways underlying these abnormalities remain uncertain. GSK3beta and CDK5 are protein kinases that are converging points for a vast number of signaling cascades, including those controlling cellular processes critical to learning and memory. We investigated whether levels of GSK3beta and CDK5 are affected by moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), specifically in the hippocampus and medial frontal cortex of the adolescent mouse. In the present work we utilized immunoblotting techniques to demonstrate that moderate PAE increased hippocampal p35 and beta-catenin, and decreased total levels of GSK3beta, while increasing GSK3beta Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation. Interestingly, different alterations were seen in the medial frontal cortex where p35 and CDK5 were decreased and increased total GSK3beta was accompanied by reduced Tyr216 of the enzyme. These results suggest that kinase dysregulation during adolescence might be an important contributing factor to the effects of PAE on hippocampal and medial frontal cortical functioning; and by extension, that global modulation of these kinases may produce differing effects depending on brain region.

N2  - The significant consequences of ethanol use during pregnancy are neurobehavioral abnormalities involving hippocampal and neocortex malfunctions that cause learning and memory deficits collectively named fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are still poorly understood and therefore warrant systematic research. Here, we document novel epigenetic abnormalities in the mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Ethanol treatment of P7 mice, which induces activation of caspase 3, impaired DNA methylation through reduced DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3A) levels. Inhibition of caspase 3 activity, before ethanol treatment, rescued DNMT1, DNMT3A proteins as well as DNA methylation levels. Blockade of histone methyltransferase (G9a) activity or cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1R), prior to ethanol treatment, which, respectively, inhibits or prevents activation of caspase 3, rescued the DNMT1 and DNMT3A proteins and DNA methylation. No reduction of DNMT1 and DNMT3A proteins and DNA methylation was found in P7 CB1R null mice, which exhibit no ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3. Together, these data demonstrate that ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3 impairs DNA methylation through DNMT1 and DNMT3A in the neonatal mouse brain, and such impairments are absent in CB1R null mice. Epigenetic events mediated by DNA methylation may be one of the essential mechanisms of ethanol teratogenesis.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: An overview for pediatric and adolescent care providers
A1  - Senturias Y.S.N.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a term used to describe the spectrum of conditions associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. These are characterized by facial dysmorphia, growth deficits and central nervous system abnormalities. FASDs are the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability in the United States and have high financial costs. Therefore, efforts at prevention are paramount. When an individual with an FASD goes undiagnosed and when appropriate interventions are not instituted, secondary disabilities such as substance abuse, school dropout, and criminal involvement are common with corresponding suffering endured by both the affected individual and the family. The diagnostic process opens up access to existing tools and resources, including the new American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) FASD algorithm for the evaluation of FASDs, the new AAP FASD toolkit and evidence-based interventions specific to FASDs. Pediatric and adolescent clinicians are challenged to participate in the continuum of care from FASD prevention to identification, diagnosis, and management, including provision of supportive services for families in order for clinicians to make a difference in this 100% preventable disorder. © 2014 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Background: Detection of in-pregnancy maternal risk alcohol drinking is an essential first step in preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and the widely used T-ACE screen was developed for that purpose. We recently reported that increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point from 2 to 3 doubled specificity of detecting risk drinking in pregnancy and identified 4-year-old children with neurobehavioral effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: In this study, the TACER-3 was further validated in another prospectively identified high-risk urban cohort. Women were categorized as follows: (i) Not At-Risk Group (negative on T-ACE and TACER-3); (ii) At-Risk Group (positive on T-ACE and TACER-3); and (iii) Change Risk Group (positive on T-ACE but negative on TACER-3). Results: The TACER-3 total score cut-point of 3 yielded fewer "false positives" than the T-ACE cut-point of 2. Based on relative risk scores, women in the TACER-3-positive At-Risk Group were more likely to drink alcohol during pregnancy than women in the Change Risk Group. In contrast, women in the Not At-Risk Group were largely not different in their drinking from women in the Change Risk Group. The largest increases in relative risk of the At-Risk Group compared to the Change Risk Group were for the amount of drinking per day across pregnancy (RR = 11.4) and for the amount of drinking per drinking day at the first prenatal visit (RR = 12.7). For both of these measures, the relative risk of at-risk alcohol consumption in the At-Risk Group was over >10 times that of the Change Risk Group. Conclusions: Thus, the TACER-3 was more effective at selectively identifying women drinking at fetal risk levels than the original T-ACE. The TACER-3 allows for more efficient use of healthcare provider time in directing targeted clinical interventions with pregnant women identified as drinking at fetal risk levels. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Plasma or circulating miRNAs (cirmiRNAs) have potential diagnostic value as biomarkers for a range of diseases. Based on observations that ethanol (EtOH) altered intracellular miRNAs during development, we tested the hypothesis that plasma miRNAs were biomarkers for maternal alcohol exposure, and for past in utero exposure, in the neonate. Methods: Pregnant sheep were exposed to a binge model of EtOH consumption resulting in an average peak blood alcohol content of 243 mg/dl, for a third-trimester-equivalent period from gestational day 4 (GD4) to GD132. MiRNA profiles were assessed by quantitative PCR analysis in plasma, erythrocyte, and leukocytes obtained from nonpregnant ewes, and plasma from pregnant ewes 24 hours following the last binge EtOH episode, and from newborn lambs, at birth on ~GD147. Results: Pregnant ewe and newborn lamb cirmiRNA profiles were similar to each other and different from nonpregnant female plasma, erythrocyte, or leukocyte miRNAs. Significant changes in cirmiRNA profiles were observed in the EtOH-exposed ewe and, at birth, in the in utero, EtOH-exposed lamb. CirmiRNAs including miR-9, -15b, -19b, and -20a were sensitive and specific measures of EtOH exposure in both pregnant ewe and newborn lamb. Additionally, EtOH exposure altered guide-to-passenger strand cirmiRNA ratios in the pregnant ewe, but not in the lamb. Conclusions: Shared profiles between pregnant dam and neonate suggest possible maternal-fetal miRNA transfer. CirmiRNAs are biomarkers for alcohol exposure during pregnancy, in both mother and neonate, and may constitute an important shared endocrine biomarker that is vulnerable to the maternal environment. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Identifying maternal risk factors associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: a systematic review
A1  - Esper L.H.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - To identify the demographic, psychological, and social maternal risk factors associated with the development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). A bibliographic search was conducted in PubMed, SciELO, Lilacs, Web of Knowledge, and PsycINFO. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the studies with case-control design. Articles were selected based on their relevance and presentation of data related to statistical comparisons of at least one or more demographic, psychological, or social maternal risk factors for FASD. 738 references were identified, of which 15 met the criteria to be included in the present review. Mothers of FASD children tend to: be older at the time of birth of the affected child, present lower educational level, have other family relatives with alcohol abuse, have other children with FASD, present a pattern of little prenatal care and a distinguishing pattern of alcohol consumption (alcohol use before and during pregnancy, failure to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy, and frequent episodes of binge drinking). Application of the NOS scale of methodological quality indicated that 8 studies (53 %) met the criterion for selection, 4 (27 %) were suitable for the criterion for comparability and only 4 studies were suitable for the exposition criterion. Mothers of FASD children have a distinctive pattern of drinking and accumulate several social risk factors. Maternal age at birth of the child seems to accentuate the risk. There are, however, few controlled studies that are adequate according to the NOS requirements for methodological quality. Fewer are based on the verification of a theoretical model. Clinicians should be aware of the relevance of preventive assessment of FASD risk mothers.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is responsible for a broad range of brain structural malformations, which can be studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Advanced MRI methods have emerged to characterize brain abnormalities, but the teratogenic effects of alcohol on cortical morphology have received little attention to date. Twenty-four 9-year-old children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (9 with fetal alcohol syndrome, 15 heavy exposed nonsyndromal children) and 16 age-matched controls were studied to assess the effect of alcohol consumption during pregnancy on cortical morphology. An automated method was applied to 3D T1-weighted images to assess cortical gyrification using global and regional sulcal indices and two region-based morphological measurements, mean sulcal depth and fold opening. Increasing levels of alcohol exposure were related to reduced cortical folding complexity, even among children with normal brain size, indicating a reduction of buried cortical surface. Fold opening was the strongest anatomical correlate of prenatal alcohol intake, indicating a widening of sulci in all regions that were examined. These data identify cortical morphology as a suitable marker for further investigation of brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - South Africa has the highest rate of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the world. While efforts have been made to curb the high rate of FAS, little is known about situational factors that may contribute to alcohol use during pregnancy. In the current paper, we focus on the role of food insecurity and its relationship to alcohol use among pregnant women. Women completed computer-assisted interviews. Generalized linear modeling was used in all analyses. Women attending alcohol-serving establishments in a township in Cape Town, South Africa were recruited for the study. Five hundred sixty women were sampled and 95 women reported being pregnant. High levels of alcohol use were reported among pregnant women: 65 % of women consumed alcohol at least every month and 29 % consumed alcohol as often as two to three times per week. Thirty-four percent of the women reported having six or more drinks per occasion on at least a weekly basis. The majority (87 %) of pregnant women reported experiencing some form of food insecurity (e.g., food unavailable, eating less) in the past month. Alcohol use was significantly associated with food insecurity, even when controlling for relevant demographic variables. Intervention with pregnant women who consume alcohol is urgently needed. Future research should focus on understanding the intersection of food insecurity and alcohol, and how the experience of food insecurity may contribute to greater rates of alcohol use and abuse among pregnant women.

T1  - Autophagy and ethanol neurotoxicity
A1  - Luo J.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Excessive ethanol exposure is detrimental to the brain. The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to ethanol such that prenatal ethanol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Neuronal loss in the brain is the most devastating consequence and is associated with mental retardation and other behavioral deficits observed in FASD. Since alcohol consumption during pregnancy has not declined, it is imperative to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop effective therapeutic strategies. One cellular mechanism that acts as a protective response for the central nervous system (CNS) is autophagy. Autophagy regulates lysosomal turnover of organelles and proteins within cells, and is involved in cell differentiation, survival, metabolism, and immunity. We have recently shown that ethanol activates autophagy in the developing brain. The autophagic preconditioning alleviates ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis, whereas inhibition of autophagy potentiates ethanol-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exacerbates ethanol-induced neuroapoptosis. The expression of genes encoding proteins required for autophagy in the CNS is developmentally regulated; their levels are much lower during an ethanol-sensitive period than during an ethanol-resistant period. Ethanol may stimulate autophagy through multiple mechanisms; these include induction of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, modulation of MTOR and AMPK signaling, alterations in BCL2 family proteins, and disruption of intracellular calcium (Ca2C) homeostasis. This review discusses the most recent evidence regarding the involvement of autophagy in ethanolmediated neurotoxicity as well as the potential therapeutic approach of targeting autophagic pathways.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a prenatal disease characterized by fetal morphological and neurological abnormalities originating from exposure to alcohol. Although FAS is a well-described pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying its progression are virtually unknown. Moreover, alcohol abuse can affect vitamin metabolism and absorption, although how alcohol impairs such biochemical pathways remains to be elucidated. We employed a variety of systems chemo-biology tools to understand the interplay between ethanol metabolism and vitamins during mouse neurodevelopment. For this purpose, we designed interactomes and employed transcriptomic data analysis approaches to study the neural tissue of Mus musculus exposed to ethanol prenatally and postnatally, simulating conditions that could lead to FAS development at different life stages. Our results showed that FAS can promote early changes in neurotransmitter release and glutamate equilibrium, as well as an abnormal calcium influx that can lead to neuroinflammation and impaired neurodifferentiation, both extensively connected with vitamin action and metabolism. Genes related to retinoic acid, niacin, vitamin D, and folate metabolism were underexpressed during neurodevelopment and appear to contribute to neuroinflammation progression and impaired synapsis. Our results also indicate that genes coding for tubulin, tubulin-associated proteins, synapse plasticity proteins, and proteins related to neurodifferentiation are extensively affected by ethanol exposure. Finally, we developed a molecular model of how ethanol can affect vitamin metabolism and impair neurodevelopment.

N2  - CONCLUSIONS: The lower NAA levels seen in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure may reflect impaired neuronal integrity in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Our finding of lower Cho points to disrupted Cho metabolism of membrane phospholipids, reflecting altered neuropil development with potentially reduced content of dendrites and synapses. The alcohol-related alterations in Glx may suggest a disruption of the glutamate-glutamine cycling involved in glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission., BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to impairment in cerebellar structure and function, including eyeblink conditioning. The deep cerebellar nuclei, which play a critical role in cerebellar-mediated learning, receive extensive inputs from brain stem and cerebellar cortex and provide the point of origin for most of the output fibers to other regions of the brain. We used in vivo (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurochemistry in this important cerebellar region., METHODS: MRS data from the deep cerebellar nuclei were acquired from 37 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 17 non- or minimally exposed controls from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa., RESULTS: Increased maternal alcohol consumption around time of conception was associated with lower N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the deep nuclei (r = -0.33, p < 0.05). Higher levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to lower levels of the choline-containing metabolites (r = -0.37, p < 0.01), glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine (Cho). Alcohol consumption levels both at conception (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and during pregnancy (r = 0.38, p < 0.01) were related to higher levels of glutamate plus glutamine (Glx). All these effects continued to be significant after controlling for potential confounders.

N2  - Background: Maternal risk factors for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in Italy and Mediterranean cultures need clarification, as there are few studies and most are plagued by inaccurate reporting of antenatal alcohol use. Methods: Maternal interviews (n= 905) were carried out in a population-based study of the prevalence and characteristics of FASD in the Lazio region of Italy which provided data for multivariate case control comparisons and multiple correlation models. Results: Case control findings from interviews seven years post-partum indicate that mothers of children with FASD are significantly more likely than randomly-selected controls or community mothers to: be shorter; have higher body mass indexes (BMI); be married to a man with legal problems; report more drinking three months pre-pregnancy; engage in more current drinking and drinking alone and have alcohol problems in her family. Logistic regression analysis of multiple candidate predictors of a FASD diagnosis indicates that alcohol problems in the child's family is the most significant risk factor, making a diagnosis within the continuum of FASD 9 times more likely (95%. C.I.= 1.6 to 50.7). Sequential multiple regression analysis of the child's neuropsychological performance also identifies alcohol problems in the child's family as the only significant maternal risk variable (p< .001) when controlling for other potential risk factors. Conclusions: Underreporting of prenatal alcohol use has been demonstrated among Italian and other Mediterranean antenatal samples, and it was suspected in this sample. Nevertheless, several significant maternal risk factors for FASD have been identified.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) and believed to be the leading known cause of developmental disabilities in the United States. Our objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) intervention may reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women in Southern California. Methods: Southern California AIAN women of childbearing age who completed a survey including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use were randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former group completed an online SBIRT intervention, and were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. Results: Of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, one-third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior (drinks per week, p < 0.001; frequency of heavy episodic [binge] drinking episodes per 2 weeks, p = 0.017 and risk of AEP p < 0.001 at 6 months postintervention) in the follow-up period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Baseline factors associated with decreased risk of an AEP at follow-up included the perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per week, having reported a greater number of binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, and depression/impaired functionality. Conclusions: Participation in assessment alone may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the web-based SBIRT intervention. Randomization to the SBIRT did not result in a significantly different change in risky drinking behaviors. The importance of perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/functionality may have implications for future interventions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This is the first national study worldwide that objectively measures the rate of heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Meconium analysis of the established biomarker of in utero alcohol exposure, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) is used as an objective measure of heavy alcohol exposure. METHODS: In collaboration with the MIREC study, 2,000 pregnant women were recruited across Canada, with 1,537 consenting to meconium analysis. Meconium samples were analyzed for 4 FAEEs via GC-MS analysis. A positive sample has a total [FAEE] greater than 2 nmol/g. Alcohol self-report was collected via questionnaire and compared to analytical results. The rate of false-positive results increases in a predictable manner with delayed sample collection and is accounted for in incidence rate calculation. RESULTS: Thus far, 690 samples have been processed with 609 eligible for analysis. Analysis results with maternal alcohol consumption self-report data are summarized in the table. The incidence rate of heavy fetal alcohol exposure in Canada was 2.55%. CONCLUSION: This study is the first of its kind to objectively measure the rate of heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Canada. Because 40% of heavily exposed fetuses develop FASD, our study predicts a rate of at least 1% of FASD in Canada, corresponding to 3,750 new cases yearly. (Table Presented).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are thought to be a leading cause of developmental disabilities worldwide. However, data are lacking on alcohol use among pregnant women in many countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of alcohol consumption by pregnant women in Ukraine., METHODS: Cross-sectional screening of pregnant women was conducted in 2 regions of Ukraine during the recruitment phase of an ongoing clinical study that is part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. Women attending a routine prenatal visit at 1 of 2 participating regional centers were asked about alcohol consumption. Quantity and frequency of alcoholic beverages consumed in the month around conception and in the most recent month of pregnancy were measured using a standard interview instrument., RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2012, 11,909 pregnant women were screened on average in the second trimester of pregnancy. Of these, 92.7% reported being ever-drinkers. Among ever-drinkers, 54.8% reported drinking alcohol in the month around conception and 12.9% consumed at least 3 drinks on at least 1 day in that time period. In the most recent month of pregnancy, 46.3% continued to report alcohol use and 9.2% consumed at least 3 drinks per day. Significant predictors of average number of drinks or heavier drinking per day in either time period in pregnancy included lower gravidity, being single, unmarried/living with a partner, or separated, lower maternal education, smoking, younger age at initiation of drinking, and higher score on the TWEAK screening test for harmful drinking., CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the need for education/intervention in women of childbearing age in Ukraine and can help inform targeted interventions for women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The initiation of a standard screening protocol in pregnancy is a step in the right direction.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol significantly alters the developmental trajectory of progenitor cells and fundamentally compromises tissue formation (i.e., histogenesis). Emerging research suggests that ethanol can impair mammalian development by interfering with the execution of molecular programs governing differentiation. For example, ethanol exposure disrupts cellular migration, changes cell-cell interactions, and alters growth factor signaling pathways. Additionally, ethanol can alter epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression. Normally, lineage-specific regulatory factors (i.e., transcription factors) establish the transcriptional networks of each new cell type; the cell's identity then is maintained through epigenetic alterations in the way in which the DNA encoding each gene becomes packaged within the chromatin. Ethanol exposure can induce epigenetic changes that do not induce genetic mutations but nonetheless alter the course of fetal development and result in a large array of patterning defects. Two crucial enzyme complexes-the Polycomb and Trithorax proteins-are central to the epigenetic programs controlling the intricate balance between self-renewal and the execution of cellular differentiation, with diametrically opposed functions. Prenatal ethanol exposure may disrupt the functions of these two enzyme complexes, altering a crucial aspect of mammalian differentiation. Characterizing the involvement of Polycomb and Trithorax group complexes in the etiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders will undoubtedly enhance understanding of the role that epigenetic programming plays in this complex disorder.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) is embedded in a matrix of biological, social and ethical processes, making it an important topic for crossdisciplinary social and ethical research. This article reviews different branches of research relevant to understanding how FASD is identified and defined and outlines a framework for future social and ethical research in this area. We outline the character of scientific research into FASD, epidemiological discrepancies between reported patterns of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the incidence of FASD, and the social and ethical considerations that may impact on who is, and is not, diagnosed. We highlight what further research investigating FASD diagnostic processes, as well as the multi-generational impacts of FASD, is needed. Important research priorities are to: 1) enumerate the variety of stakeholders involved in seeking FASD diagnoses; 2) understand the experiences and perspectives of mothers from different backgrounds who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy and their affected children; and 3) collect health histories of maternal alcohol consumption in families to determine the effect of FASD at sub-cultural and cultural levels.

N2  - Background: There is an emerging literature suggesting that structural abnormalities exist in offspring from families selected to have multiple members with alcohol dependence. Structures previously identified by manual tracing techniques include the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, regions involved in emotional processing. Deficits in social cognition have been reported in alcoholic patients with a suggestion that these deficits may be linked to prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. It is possible that the prefrontal cortex may be more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol experienced from either personal or prenatal exposure, or both. Alternatively, familial risk for alcohol dependence may predispose individuals to PFC structural abnormalities. Voxel based morphometry (VBM) is well suited to uncovering whole brain differences between ultra high risk offspring and controls. While most studies have selected families through an alcohol dependent father, understanding the contribution that familial maternal alcoholism has on offspring that is independent of any fetal alcohol exposure effects that the offspring experience provides an opportunity to identify pathophysiologic mechanisms that may be unique to each. With this information targeted interventions could be developed. We hypothesized that decreased gray matter volumes might be seen in the high risk offspring relative to controls in cortical structures and include those associated with facial recognition and social cognition. Also, we hypothesized that comparison of high risk offspring with and without prenatal exposure would reveal new regions unique to exposure. Methods: Structural MRI scans at 3.0 Tesla were obtained from 43 high risk offspring (Mean age 27.4+3.6 years) and 45 low-risk controls (Mean age 24.5+4.1 years). Substance use during pregnancy was obtained from mothers at a time when the young adult participants were studied as children as part of a longitudinal study. Within the high-risk group 16 offspring were exposed to alcohol and 25 were not providing an opportunity to determine which regions differed by familial risk and those due to alcohol exposure. Structural data preprocessing and analysis for this study was performed with the VBM8 toolbox (http://dbm.neuro. uni-jena.de/vbm/) within the SPM8 software (http:// www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) running on MATLAB R2014a (Mathworks). Preprocessing steps in VBM8 toolbox involves bias correction, tissue segmentation, affine registration, normalization, and modulation. Finally, modulated images were smoothed with a full-width half-maximum kernel of 12 mm. Statistical analyses were performed on these smooth images. The resulting maps were thresholded with p<0.001 with a cluster size of 50 voxels. Additionally, regional volumes were calculated using the MarsBaR ROI toolbox (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net) to compare the volume of the specified regions of interests (ROIs) which were further compared in SPSS (version 20). Results: Whole brain analysis revealed clusters in the middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and insula, regions associated with face processing in which high-risk offspring had lesser gray matter than low-risk controls. Also, found were areas of reduced gray matter in the uncus, cuneus, precuneous, claustrum, and caudate. Whole brain analysis was performed within the high risk group to assess the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on gray matter volumes. In this comparison, clusters were identified within the middle frontal, and middle temporal gyri along with the precuneus and anterior cingulate in which exposed offspring had reduced gray matter compared to those that were not exposed. One area showed greater gray matter volume in the exposed offspring, the culmen portion of the right anterior lobe of cerebellum. Region of interest analysis revealed four areas associated with facial processing with lesser gray matter in association with familial risk: the fusiform gyrus (p=0.001), middle temporal gyrus (p=0.024), insula (p=0.042) in the left hemisphere and the orbitofrontal cortex in the right hemisphere (0.040). Analyses using prenatal exposure to alcohol or cigarettes continued to show risk group differences as did analyses in which presence of SUD before the scans was used as a covariate. Correlational analysis between these regions shows highly related structural connectivity with all intercorrelations significant at< 0.001. Conclusions: The fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, insula and orbitofrontal cortex have previously been linked to facial affect perception and social cognition. The present results indicate lesser gray matter volumes in these regions in individuals at ultra high risk for developing alcohol dependence and other substance use disorders. Moreover, the results suggest that the neural underpinnings of social cognitive impairment may be present before these individuals' development substance use disorders.

N2  - Background: Repeated exposure to environmental adversity during development can cause treatment resistant, refractory depression. Although genetic research has revealed that the vulnerability to depression is partially heritable, there is also strong support for the pathogenic role of early environmental adversity in the development and expression of this disorder. Prenatal alcohol exposure has been identified as a potential risk factor for refractory depression and a high rate of comorbid depression has been reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) patients. Stem cell-based regenerative therapy is considered a promising cellular therapeutic approach for some patients with incurable brain diseases. Previously, we found that intravenous neural stem cell (NSC) treatment reversed impaired memory/cognitive function and social interaction behaviors in rats tested using a fetal alcohol exposure-induced psychiatric disorder model. Methods: In this study, we tested this approach to treat the refractory type of depression model rats caused by the combined stress exposures to prenatal ethanol and adolescent corticosterone treatments. Results: We showed that aspects of depressive-like behavior resulting from a forced swim test were reversed by the combined treatment of an antidepressant and the intravenous administration of fetal rat brain derived NSCs with atelocollagen which was used for reducing immune rejection and for potentiate effective migration of administrated cells into the brain. In addition, we showed that alterations of PV-containing GABAergic interneurons and synaptic density protein levels resulting from the combined treatment of antidepressant and NSCs in this model. Conclusions: Our results established a new role for PVcontaining GABAergic interneurons associated with treatment resistant, refractory depression-like behavior in rats and suggested possible new therapeutic options of stem cell therapies for treating refractory types of psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a birth defect due to maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the main somatic stem cells in adults and may contribute to tissue homeostasis and repair in adulthood, we investigated whether early life ethanol exposure affects MSCs and contributes to the propensity for disease onset in later life. Using a rodent model of FAS, we found that ethanol exposure (5.25 g/kg/day) from postnatal days 4 to 9 in rat pups (mimic of human third trimester) caused long-term anomalies in bone marrow-derived MSCs. MSCs isolated from ethanol-exposed animals were prone to neural induction but resistant to osteogenic and adipogenic inductions compared to their age-matched controls. The altered differentiation may contribute to the severe trabecular bone loss seen in ethanol-exposed animals at 3 months of age as well as overt growth retardation. Expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, aP2, and PPAR were substantially inhibited, but BDNF was up-regulated in MSCs isolated from ethanol-exposed 3 month-old animals. Several signaling pathways were distorted in ethanol-exposed MSCs via altered trimethylation at histone 3 lysine 27. These results demonstrate that early life ethanol exposure can have long-term impacts in rat MSCs by both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.

T1  - Embryo transfers between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice: Examination of a maternal effect on ethanol teratogenesis
A1  - Gilliam D.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Genetic factors influence fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) in both humans and animals. Experiments using inbred and selectively bred mouse stocks that controlled for (1) ethanol dose, (2) maternal and fetal blood ethanol levels, and (3) fetal developmental exposure stage, show genotype can affect teratogenic outcome. Other experiments distinguish the teratogenic effects mediated by maternal genotype from those mediated by fetal genotype. One technique to distinguish maternal versus fetal genotype effect is to utilize embryo transfers. This study is the first to examine ethanol teratogenesis - fetal weight deficits and mortality, and digit, kidney, and vertebral malformations - in C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) fetuses that were transferred as blastocysts into B6 and D2 dams. We hypothesized that, following maternal alcohol exposure, B6 and D2 fetuses gestating within B6 mothers, as compared to D2 mothers, will exhibit a higher frequency of malformations. On day 9 of pregnancy, females were intubated (IG) with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or maltose-dextrin (MD). Other females were mated within strain and treated with either ethanol or maltose, or were not exposed to either treatment. Implantation rates were affected by genotype. Results show more B6 embryos implanted into D2 females than B6 females (p < 0.05; 47% vs. 23%, respectively). There was no difference in the percentage of D2 embryos implanting into B6 and D2 females (14 and 16%, respectfully). Litter mortality averaged 24% across all experimental groups. Overall, in utero ethanol exposure reduced mean litter weight compared to maltose treatment (E = 1.01 g; MD = 1.19 g; p < 0.05); but maltose exposed litters with transferred embryos weighed more than similarly treated natural litters (1.30 g vs. 1.11 g; p < 0.05). Approximately 50% of all ethanol exposed B6 fetuses exhibited some malformation (digit, vertebral, and/or kidney) regardless of whether they were transferred into a B6 or D2 female, or were naturally conceived. This suggests the D2 maternal uterine environment did not offer any protection against ethanol teratogenesis for B6 fetuses. One of the questions remaining is the how the B6 uterine environment affects D2 teratogenesis. No definitive conclusions can be drawn because too few viable D2 litters were produced.

N2  - Objectives To estimate incidence and prevalence of FASD by sex and age in Alberta, Canada., Methods We included all patients recorded in the Alberta provincial health databases of inpatients, outpatients, and practitioner claims from 2003 to 2012. The number of people with FASD were calculated from available data on FAS (ICD-9 code 760.71; ICD-10 codes Q86.0 and P04.3) and estimated prevalence of FASD among individuals diagnosed with 21 FASD-related conditions (identified by a literature review) for which there are ICD codes, such as learning disability, mental retardation, and nervous system defects (Table 1). Fractions of FASD-related diagnoses that can be attributed to alcohol use during pregnancy were estimated by a systematic review. The incidence was measured as the number of new cases per 1000 births. The prevalence was measured as the number of cases per 1000 population in 2012., Results Annually, 739 to 1884 people were born with FASD in Alberta establishing an incidence of 14.2 to 43.8 per 1000 births, depending on the length of follow-up. There were about 46,000 people living with FASD in Alberta 2012, including 6,000 FAS cases and 40,000 FASD-related cases. The prevalence of FASD was 11.7 (range 8.2 to 15.1) per 1000 population. The incidence and prevalence varied greatly by sex and age group. Generally, male and younger outnumbered female and older., Conclusion This study suggests new incidence and prevalence of FASD, which are higher than what has been commonly used (1%), and its variations among sex and age groups.

N2  - Reductions in brain volumes represent a neurobiological signature of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Less clear is how regional brain tissue reductions differ after normalizing for brain size differences linked with FASD and whether these profiles can predict the degree of prenatal exposure to alcohol. To examine associations of regional brain tissue excesses/deficits with degree of prenatal alcohol exposure and diagnosis with and without correction for overall brain volume, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) methods were applied to structural imaging data from a well-characterized, demographically homogeneous sample of children diagnosed with FASD (n = 39, 9.6-11.0 years) and controls (n = 16, 9.5-11.0 years). Degree of prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated with regionally pervasive brain tissue reductions in: (1) the thalamus, midbrain, and ventromedial frontal lobe, (2) the superior cerebellum and inferior occipital lobe, (3) the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and (4) the precuneus and superior parietal lobule. When overall brain size was factored out of the analysis on a subject-by-subject basis, no regions showed significant associations with alcohol exposure. FASD diagnosis was associated with a similar deformation pattern, but few of the regions survived FDR correction. In data-driven independent component analyses (ICA) regional brain tissue deformations successfully distinguished individuals based on extent of prenatal alcohol exposure and to a lesser degree, diagnosis. The greater sensitivity of the continuous measure of alcohol exposure compared with the categorical diagnosis across diverse brain regions underscores the dose dependence of these effects. The ICA results illustrate that profiles of brain tissue alterations may be a useful indicator of prenatal alcohol exposure when reliable historical data are not available and facial features are not apparent.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a wide range of deficits in executive function that persist throughout life, but little is known about how changes in brain structure relate to cognition in affected individuals. In the current study, we predicted that the rate of white matter volumetric development would be atypical in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) when compared to typically developing children, and that the rate of change in cognitive function would relate to differential white matter development between groups. Data were available for 103 subjects [49 with FASD, 54 controls, age range 6-17, mean age = 11.83] with 153 total observations. Groups were age-matched. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an executive function (EF) battery. Using white matter volumes measured bilaterally for frontal and parietal regions and the corpus callosum, change was predicted by modeling the effects of age, intracranial volume, sex, and interactions with exposure status and EF measures. While both groups showed regional increases in white matter volumes and improvement in cognitive performance over time, there were significant effects of exposure status on age-related relationships between white matter increases and EF measures. Specifically, individuals with FASD consistently showed a positive relationship between improved cognitive function and increased white matter volume over time, while no such relationships were seen in controls. These novel results relating improved cognitive function with increased white matter volume in FASD suggest that better cognitive outcomes could be possible for FASD subjects through interventions that enhance white matter plasticity.

N2  - Background and aims Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with several adverse outcomes for the developing child, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most well-known. In The Netherlands it is recommended not to drink any alcohol while pregnant. Our objective was to describe the prevalence and pattern of alcohol consumption during pregnancy in the Netherlands. Methods In 2007 and 2010 we undertook two nation-wide surveys amongst mothers who brought their infant aged <6 months to a well-baby clinic. Survey-data were weighted for educational attainments to represent national figures. Results In 2007 data were obtained from 2768 and in 2010 from 1448 women. Between 2007 and 2010, the frequency of drinking did not increase, but the amount per occasion did. Overall, 21% of women reported that they had drunk alcohol during pregnancy. Of women who drank alcohol during the first 3 months, 25% reported 1-3 drinking occasions per month; 7% reported weekly intake, and 0.5% reported daily intake of alcohol. Binge drinking (>6 drinks/occasion) while pregnant was reported by 8%. In 2007, 53% had <1, 40% had 1-3, and 7% had >3 drinks/occasion. In 2010 this was respectively 4%, 83%, and 13%. As compared to the first three months, in the last six months of pregnancy alcohol intake was somewhat less. Alcohol consumption in pregnancy was more prevalent amongst older (>35 years of age), higher educated women, and amongst women who reported that they had smoked tobacco products while pregnant (adj. OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.51-2.73). Conclusions Despite current recommendations, in 2007 and 2010, 21% of Dutch women drank alcohol while pregnant.

N2  - Background: Alcohol is detrimental to early development. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) due to maternal alcohol abuse results in a series of developmental abnormalities including cranial facial dysmorphology, ocular anomalies, congenital heart defects, microcephaly and intellectual disabilities. Previous studies have been shown that ethanol exposure causes neural crest (NC) apoptosis and perturbation of neural crest migration. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this report we investigated the fetal effect of alcohol on the process of neural crest development in the Xenopus leavis. Results: Pre-gastrulation exposure of 2-4% alcohol induces apoptosis in Xenopus embryo whereas 1% alcohol specifically impairs neural crest migration without observing discernible apoptosis. Additionally, 1% alcohol treatment considerably increased the phenotype of small head (43.4% +/- 4.4%, total embryo n = 234), and 1.5% and 2.0% dramatically augment the deformation to 81.2% +/- 6.5% (n = 205) and 91.6% +/- 3.0% (n = 235), respectively (P < 0.05). Significant accumulation of Homocysteine was caused by alcohol treatment in embryos and 5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate restores neural crest migration and alleviates homocysteine accumulation, resulting in inhibition of the alcohol-induced neurocristopathies. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that prenatal alcohol exposure causes neural crest cell migration abnormality and 5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate could be beneficial for treating FASD.

N2  - The Western Cape of South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) globally. Reducing alcohol use during pregnancy is a pressing public health priority for this region, but insight into the experiences of women who drink during pregnancy is lacking. Convenience sampling in alcohol-serving venues was used to identify women who were currently pregnant (. n=12) or recently post-partum (. n=12) and reported drinking during the pregnancy period. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between April and August 2013. Interviews explored drinking narratives, with textual data analyzed for themes related to factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy. All but one woman reported her pregnancy as unplanned. The majority sustained or increased drinking after pregnancy recognition, with patterns typically including multiple days of binge drinking per week. Analysis of the textual data revealed five primary factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy: 1) women used alcohol as a strategy to cope with stressors and negative emotions, including those associated with pregnancy; 2) women drank as a way to retain social connection, often during a difficult period of life transition; 3) social norms in women's peer groups supported drinking during pregnancy; 4) women lacked attachment to the pregnancy or were resistant to motherhood; and 5) women were driven physiologically by alcohol addiction. Our data suggest that alcohol-serving settings are important sites to identify and target women at risk of drinking during pregnancy. Intervention approaches to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy should include counseling and contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies, mental health and coping interventions targeting pregnant women, peer-based interventions to change norms around perinatal drinking, and treatment for alcohol dependence during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that innovative interventions that go beyond the boundaries of the health care system are urgently needed to address FASD in this region.

N2  - In the review the literature data on the effect of alcohol on the developing brain of human and animals are summarized. The information is presented on the neuroimaging, histological, cellular and molecular-genetic disturbances in the brain in fetal alcohol syndrome and following exposure to alcohol during the early postnatal period. The structural developmental abnormalities of the different parts of the brain, disorders of neurogenesis and neuronal apoptosis, changes in metabolism, receptors and secondary signals system of neurons are described. Prenatal alcohol exposure causes significant, various long-term disturbances of the brain structures at the organ, tissue, cellular and subcellular level, which may lay in the basis of the observed neurological, behavioral and metal disorders.

T1  - Protective effects of the alcohol dehydrogenase-ADH1B*3 allele on attention and behavior problems in adolescents exposed to alcohol during pregnancy

N2  - Alcohol dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of alcohol. Expression of three alleles at the ADH1B locus results in enzymes that differ in turnover rate and affinity for alcohol. The ADH1B*3 allele, which appears to be unique to individuals of African descent, is associated with more rapid alcohol metabolism than the more prevalent ADH1B*1 allele. It has been previously demonstrated that the presence of at least one maternal ADH1B*3 allele confers a protective effect against alcohol teratogenicity in infants and children. This study was conducted to determine whether the presence of the ADH1B*3 allele in the mother or child continues to be protective in alcohol-exposed individuals during adolescence. 186 adolescents and 167 mothers participating in a 14-year follow-up of the Detroit Longitudinal Cohort were genotyped for ADH1B alleles. Behavioral reports were obtained from classroom teachers. Frequencies of the ADH1B*3 allele were 17.6% in the mothers and 21.0% in the adolescents, which are consistent with the 15-20% expected for African Americans. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with increased attention problems and externalizing behaviors in adolescents born to mothers with two ADH1B*1 alleles but not in those whose mothers had at least one ADH1B*3 allele. A similar pattern was seen in relation to the presence or absence of an ADH1B*3 allele in the adolescent, which may have reflected the presence/absence of the maternal variant. This study is the first to demonstrate that the protective effects of the maternal ADH1B*3 allele continue to be evident during adolescence. These persistent individual differences in vulnerability of offspring to the behavioral effects of fetal alcohol exposure are likely attributable to more rapid metabolism of alcohol that the ADH1B*3 variant confers on the mother, leading to a reduction of the peak blood alcohol concentration to which the fetus is exposed during each drinking episode. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in long-term cognitive and behavioral deficits. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) refers to a range of permanent birth defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, and is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in the US. Studies by autopsy and conventional structural MRI indicate that the midline structures of the brain are particularly vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown that abnormalities in brain white matter especially the corpus callosum are very common in FASD. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel technique that measures tissue's magnetic property. Such magnetic property is affected by tissue microstructure and molecular composition including that of myelin in the white matter. In this work, we studied three major white matter fiber bundles of a mouse model of FASD and compared it to control mice using both QSM and DTI. QSM revealed clear and significant abnormalities in anterior commissure, corpus callosum, and hippocampal commissure, which were likely due to reduced myelination. Our data also suggested that QSM may be even more sensitive than DTI for examining changes due to prenatal alcohol exposure. Although this is a preclinical study, the technique of QSM is readily translatable to human brain.

N2  - When alcohol is consumed during the prenatal period, it may result in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in the offspring. The aim of this study is to investigate neuroapoptosis on the cerebral cortex of rat pups caused by prenatal alcohol exposure with modified liquid diet and to illuminate the protective effects of betaine and folic acid supplementation. Being alcohol-induced apoptosis indicators on the cerebral cortex of rat pups, cytochrome c, caspase 3 and calpain levels were checked. Cytochrome c level in ethanol+folic acid group (p < 0.05), caspase 3 level in ethanol+betaine+folic acid group (p < 0.01), calpain level in both ethanol+folic acid (p < 0.01) and ethanol+betaine+folic acid groups (p < 0.01) were found to be significantly lower than ethanol group. Cerebral cortex tissues were examined histologically in terms of congestion, edema, necrosis and chromatolysis. While ethanol increased the number of apoptotic cells, it was decreased in ethanol+betaine (p < 0.05) and ethanol+betaine+folic acid groups (p < 0.05). Morphometric examination showed that while the diameter of apoptotic cells increased with ethanol administration (p < 0.01), they were lowered at ethanol+betaine (p < 0.001) and ethanol+betaine+folic acid groups (p < 0.001). As a result, we found that ethanol is capable of triggering cell death in the ethanol-administered rat pups and folic acid and betaine may reduce apoptosis either alone or together.

N2  - In this study, the aim was to investigate the prenatal alcoholinduced oxidative stress on rat cerebral cortex of newborn pups and assess the protective and beneficial effects of Boric acid (BA) supplementation on rats with Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Pregnant rats were divided into three groups as control group, alcohol group and alcohol + boric acid group. As markers of alcohol-induced oxidative stress in newborn pups' cerebral cortex, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were measured. Although MDA levels in alcohol-administered group was significantly increased compared to control group (p < 0.05), its level in the alcohol + boric acid group was shown to significantly decrease compared to alcohol group (p < 0.01). CAT activity of alcohol + boric acid group was found statistically higher than the alcohol group (p < 0.05). GPx activity in the alcohol group was decreased compared to control group (p < 0.05). As a result, we found that alcohol was capable of triggering damage to membranes on cerebral cortex of rat pups and BA could be influential on antioxidant mechanisms resulting from prenatal alcohol.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Aim There are alarming rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in the Kimberley region of Western Australia despite numerous international studies demonstrating the links between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and FASD. The aim of this research was to help determine factors that may be associated with correct knowledge about safe drinking practices during pregnancy, with these factors used to help inform future interventions. Method Ninety-nine residents (40 males, 59 females, 39% of which self-identified as Indigenous) from the Kimberley region (Broome and smaller remote communities) completed a survey examining knowledge of currently recommended safe drinking practices during pregnancy and knowledge of the outcomes for children with FASD over a period of approximately 2 months. Results The results revealed that education level (i.e. not completing high school through to completing university) is the biggest predictor (beta = 0.44, P < 0.01) of knowledge of safe drinking practices during pregnancy, and having heard of FASD (beta = 0.67, P < 0.001) was the biggest predictor of knowledge of outcomes for children with FASD. Other variables such as age, sex, Indigenous status and income level were not as important. Conclusions These findings suggest that early education regarding the consequences of alcohol consumption for women of childbearing age should be paramount in this or similar communities. Suggestions for targeted interventions are discussed in light of these findings. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption inflicts a multitude of phenotypic consequences that range from undetectable changes to severe dysmorphology. Using tightly controlled murine studies that deliver precise amounts of alcohol at discrete developmental stages, our group and other labs demonstrated in prior studies that the C57BL/6 and DBA/2 inbred mouse strains display differential susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of alcohol. Since the phenotypic diversity extends beyond the amount, dosage and timing of alcohol exposure, it is likely that an individual's genetic background contributes to the phenotypic spectrum. To identify the genomic signatures associated with these observed differences in alcohol-induced dysmorphology, we conducted a microarray-based transcriptome study that also interrogated the genomic signatures between these two lines based on genetic background and alcohol exposure. This approach is called a gene x environment (GxE) analysis; one example of a GxE interaction would be a gene whose expression level increases in C57BL/6, but decreases in DBA/2 embryos, following alcohol exposure. We identified 35 candidate genes exhibiting GxE interactions. To identify cis-acting factors that mediated these interactions, we interrogated the proximal promoters of these 35 candidates and found 241 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 16 promoters. Further investigation indicated that 186 SNVs (15 promoters) are predicted to alter transcription factor binding. In addition, 62 SNVs created, removed or altered the placement of a CpG dinucleotide in 13 of the proximal promoters, 53 of which overlapped putative transcription factor binding sites. These 53 SNVs are also our top candidates for future studies aimed at examining the effects of alcohol on epigenetic gene regulation. © 2014 Lossie, Muir, Lo, Timm, Liu, Gray and Zhou.

N2  - Background and aims: Alcohol drinking during pregnancy poses serious health risks to the unborn child such as prematurity, low or high birthweight, fetal death and fetal alcohol syndrome. However, the effects of maternal ethanol consumption before pregnancy on the abnormal development of fetus and the association with the impaired glucose tolerance of mother are not fully understood. Materials and methods: To this, the 6-week C57BL/6J female mice were fed with 5% ethanol-containing liquid diet for 2 weeks before pregnancy and examined the effects of ethanol pre-exposure on fetal development during a subsequent pregnancy. Results: Here, we found that pregnancy or fertility rates were decreased in ethanol-fed mice, correlated with the delaying of eye formation and the formation of defective toe. Also, birth weight in postnatal 0 day (P0) of ethanol- fed mice was higher than those of pair-fed mice, but thereafter, in P14 and P21, growth retardation appeared in the child of ethanol-fed mice. The macrosomia phenomenon in ethanol-fed mice is strongly associated with the dysregulation of glucose metabolism and triglyceride accumulation in maternal liver during the pregnancy. Gut-derived serotonin (GDS) as well as hepatic inflammatory chemokines and cytokines are also markedly increased in ethanol-fed mice, subsequently followed by the alteration of glucose metabolism in the liver and pancreatic beta-cells. Alcohol intake changed the expression of GDS-response receptors from Gs-GPCR to Gi or Gq-GPCR. The detrimental fetal development and impaired glucose metabolism by maternal pre-exposure to ethanol are strongly attenuated by the injection of 4-methylprazol, an inhibitor of CYP2E1. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that ethanol consumption before pregnancy is a major causing factor for the detrimental fetus development via maternal metabolic disorders, especially on the dysregulation of glucose or insulin metabolism in maternal liver and pancreatic beta-cells.

N2  - Background. Recent reports indicate a decline in rates of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) among Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) infants. Nevertheless, AN/AI infants remain disproportionately impacted by the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods. AN/AI pregnant women in their 3rd trimester completed a questionnaire on demographic data and the amount and frequency of their alcohol consumption in the month prior to conception and during pregnancy. Differences across demographics and trimesters were tested with the Chi-square, Fisher's exact or McNemar's test as appropriate. Results. Of the 125 participants, 56% (n=71) reported no alcohol consumption in the 1st through 3rd trimesters of pregnancy; 30% (n=38) of the 125 participants also reported no alcohol consumption in the month before pregnancy. Of the 43% (n=54) who reported consuming alcohol during pregnancy (1st, 2nd and/or 3rd trimester), most (35%) reported alcohol use only in the 1st trimester. Binge drinking in the 1st or 2nd trimester was reported amongst 20% (n=25) of participants with an additional 18% (n=29) reporting binge drinking in the month prior to pregnancy. Women who reported pre-conception binge drinking were significantly more likely to report binge drinking during their 1st trimester (p<0.0001) and 2nd trimester (p<0.0001). A history of tobacco use (p=0.0403) and cigarette smoking during pregnancy (p<0.0001) were also associated with binge drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion. Among study participants, reported use of alcohol was primarily limited to pre-conception and the 1st trimester, with a dramatic decrease in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Prevention programmes, such as the Alaska FAS Prevention Project, may have contributed to observed decreases in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Additional study and focus on pre-conception, the 1st trimester and binge drinking, as well as tobacco use might augment Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder prevention efforts. © 2013 Burhan A.

N2  - Objective. The Brightening Our Home Fires (BOHF) project was conceptualized as an exploratory project to examine the issue of the prevention of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) from a women's health perspective in the Northwest Territories (NT). While dominant discourse suggests that FASD is preventable by abstention from alcohol during pregnancy, a broader perspective would indicate that alcohol and pregnancy is a far more complex issue, that is, bound in location, economics, social and cultural views of health. This project was prevention focused and a social determinant of health (SDH) perspective informed this research. Methods. The BOHF project was a qualitative research project using a participatory action research framework to examine women's health and healing in the north. The methodology utilized was Photovoice. Women were provided training in digital photography and given cameras to use and keep. The primary research question utilized was: What does health and healing look like for you in your community? Women described their photos, individually or in groups around this central topic. This research was FASD informed, and women participants were aware this was an FASD prevention funded project whose approach focused on a broader context of health and lived experience. Results. This project drew 30 participants from: Yellowknife, Lutsel 'ke, Behchoko and Ulukhaktok. These four different communities across the NT represented Dene and Inuit culture. The qualitative data analysis offered themes of importance to women's health in the north including: land and tradition; housing; poverty; food; family; health, mental health and trauma, and travel. Photovoice provides a non-threatening way to engage in dialogue on complex health and social issues. © 2013 Dorothy Badry and Aileen Wight Felske.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a frequent cause of mental retardation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development defects induced by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unclear. We used normal and Hsf2-deficient mice and cell systems to uncover a pivotal role for heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) in radial neuronal migration defects in the cortex, a hallmark of fetal alcohol exposure. Upon fetal alcohol exposure, HSF2 is essential for the triggering of HSF1 activation, which is accompanied by distinctive post-translational modifications, and HSF2 steers the formation of atypical alcohol-specific HSF1-HSF2 heterocomplexes. This perturbs the in vivo binding of HSF2 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in genes that control neuronal migration in normal conditions, such as p35 or the MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins, such as Dclk1 and Dcx), and alters their expression. In the absence of HSF2, migration defects as well as alterations in gene expression are reduced. Thus, HSF2, as a sensor for alcohol stress in the fetal brain, acts as a mediator of the neuronal migration defects associated with FASD. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Impaired social development is a core deficit of FASD. Severe social impairments persist with age and have a negative impact on multiple aspects of functioning. This review critically evaluates the existing literature on social skill deficits and current interventions for social problems in the FASD population. We hypothesized that social problems manifest differently across stages of development and remain pronounced throughout the life course. Methods: Empirical and review studies were ascertained via a computer-based search of PubMeand Web of Science search engine. Searches included different combinations of a main set of keywords: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, Prenatal Alcohol Exposure, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, social skills, social cognition, intervention, treatment, adaptive behaviour and social behaviour. Archival searches from published review papers were also conducted. Results: Social development including social interactions, adaptive behaviours and social cognition are impaired throughout the lifespan in the FASD population. Neonates and infants show significantly impaired arousal states and atypical or delayed developmental behaviours, while older children experience marked difficulties with interpersonal interactions. In adolescence, social impairments often manifest in delinquent and defiant behaviours that continue into adulthood. By working with the affected individual and the caregiver, successful programs are able to address the unique developmental needs of the FASD population. Although progress is reported in several programs, interventions directly targeting social skills are scarce and none have addressed issues regarding the changing trajectory of social issues with time. Conclusions/ Discussion: Existing literature points to a distinct pattern of problematic social skills that contribute to later secondary disabilities. While early intervention is suggested to prevent compounding problems, the efficacy of current approaches is limited.

N2  - Objectives: The focus of this study is to measure the prevalence of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during pregnancy by meconium fatty-acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) analysis in a population-based setting. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) manifests a continuum of permanent birth defects and neurodevelopmental impairments that originate from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Previous literature found that of the Ugandan women who drank regularly prior to pregnancy, only 18.3% reported abstinence, whereas an astonishing 11.1% increased alcohol use, and 68.3% decreased consumption. Thus, the number of FASD cases in parts of the sub-Saharan Africa is growing, which is a cause for concern due to the socio-economic impact. Methods: Meconium samples were collected from 505 newborns between October-November 2013 at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Each meconium sample was accompanied with a questionnaire containing neonatal/maternal information. FAEEs are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol produced in the fetus are serves as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. FAEE meconium concentrations greater than 2.00 nmol/g are considered indicative of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during the last two trimesters of pregnancy. Samples were frozen and shipped to the Motherisk Laboratory for analysis. FAEEs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantified using deuterated internal standards. Results: Of the 505 samples, 68 have been analyzed by GC/MS to date, where 2 are inconclusive due to it being transitional with stool. The remaining 66 samples did not show heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Meconium FAEE analysis is currently ongoing at Motherisk Laboratory. Conclusions: The identification of specific populations in need of basic epidemiologic research on the prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure is urgently required in order to create awareness and reduce the devastation of FASD. This is the first population-wide study of an entire neonatal population examining fetal alcohol exposure conducted in Uganda.

N2  - The Western Cape of South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) globally. Reducing alcohol use during pregnancy is a pressing public health priority for this region, but insight into the experiences of women who drink during pregnancy is lacking. Convenience sampling in alcohol-serving venues was used to identify women who were currently pregnant (n=12) or recently post-partum (n=12) and reported drinking during the pregnancy period. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between April and August 2013. Interviews explored drinking narratives, with textual data analyzed for themes related to factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy. All but one woman reported her pregnancy as unplanned. The majority sustained or increased drinking after pregnancy recognition, with patterns typically including multiple days of binge drinking per week. Analysis of the textual data revealed five primary factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy: 1) women used alcohol as a strategy to cope with stressors and negative emotions, including those associated with pregnancy; 2) women drank as a way to retain social connection, often during a difficult period of life transition; 3) social norms in women's peer groups supported drinking during pregnancy; 4) women lacked attachment to the pregnancy or were resistant to motherhood; and 5) women were driven physiologically by alcohol addiction. Our data suggest that alcohol-serving settings are important sites to identify and target women at risk of drinking during pregnancy. Intervention approaches to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy should include counseling and contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies, mental health and coping interventions targeting pregnant women, peer-based interventions to change norms around perinatal drinking, and treatment for alcohol dependence during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that innovative interventions that go beyond the boundaries of the health care system are urgently needed to address FASD in this region. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Brain imaging studies suggest that cortical thickness decreases during childhood and adolescence, in concert with underlying structural and synaptic changes required for cognitive maturation and regional specialization of function. Abnormalities of this protracted developmental process may provide key insights into the cognitive and behavioral deficits that emerge in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have demonstrated cortical thickness differences in children and adolescents who were prenatally exposed to alcohol, though all have been cross sectional, limiting conclusions about cortical development with age. In this study, we analyze serially collected T1-weighted MRI from 11 children with FASD and 21 controls, scanned twice each ~2 to 4 years apart. Mixed-models analysis of cortical thickness measurements revealed age-by-group interactions in cortical thinning, with FASD participants undergoing less developmental thinning than controls across many regions of the cortex, particularly in medial frontal and parietal areas. These results provide further longitudinal evidence in humans that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with altered patterns of brain development that persist during childhood and adolescence. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Reductions in brain volumes represent a neurobiological signature of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Less clear is how regional brain tissue reductions differ after normalizing for brain size differences linked with FASD and whether these profiles can predict the degree of prenatal exposure to alcohol. To examine associations of regional brain tissue excesses/deficits with degree of prenatal alcohol exposure and diagnosis with and without correction for overall brain volume, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) methods were applied to structural imaging data from a well-characterized, demographically homogeneous sample of children diagnosed with FASD (n = 39, 9.6-11.0 years) and controls (n = 16, 9.5-11.0 years). Degree of prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated with regionally pervasive brain tissue reductions in: (1) the thalamus, midbrain, and ventromedial frontal lobe, (2) the superior cerebellum and inferior occipital lobe, (3) the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and (4) the precuneus and superior parietal lobule. When overall brain size was factored out of the analysis on a subject-by-subject basis, no regions showed significant associations with alcohol exposure. FASD diagnosis was associated with a similar deformation pattern, but few of the regions survived FDR correction. In data-driven independent component analyses (ICA) regional brain tissue deformations successfully distinguished individuals based on extent of prenatal alcohol exposure and to a lesser degree, diagnosis. The greater sensitivity of the continuous measure of alcohol exposure compared with the categorical diagnosis across diverse brain regions underscores the dose dependence of these effects. The ICA results illustrate that profiles of brain tissue alterations may be a useful indicator of prenatal alcohol exposure when reliable historical data are not available and facial features are not apparent. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gross motor (GM) deficits are often reported in children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), but their prevalence and the domains affected are not clear. The objective of this review was to characterize GM impairment in children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or "moderate" to "heavy " maternal alcohol intake. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted. Medline, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, PEDro, and Google Scholar databases were searched. Published observational studies including children aged 0 to <18 years with (1) an FASD diagnosis or moderate to heavy PAE, or a mother with confirmed alcohol dependency or binge drinking during pregnancy, and (2) GM outcomes obtained by using a standardized assessment tool. Data were extracted regarding participants, exposure, diagnosis, and outcomes by using a standardized protocol. Methodological quality was evaluated by using Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. RESULTS: The search recovered 2881 articles of which 14 met the systematic review inclusion criteria. The subjects' mean age ranged from 3 days to 13 years. Study limitations included failure to report cutoffs for impairment, nonstandardized reporting of PAE, and small sample sizes. The meta-analysis pooled results (n = 10) revealed a significant association between a diagnosis of FASD or moderate to heavy PAE and GM impairment (odds ratio: 2.9; 95% confidence interval: 2.1-4.0). GM deficits were found in balance, coordination, and ball skills. There was insufficient data to determine prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The significant results suggest evaluation of GM proficiency should be a standard component of multidisciplinary FASD diagnostic services.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters expression of neurogenesis-related genes in an ex vivo cell culture model

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to long-lasting changes in functional and genetic programs of the brain, which may underlie behavioral alterations seen in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Aberrant fetal programming during gestational alcohol exposure is a possible mechanism by which alcohol imparts teratogenic effects on the brain; however, current methods used to investigate the effects of alcohol on development often rely on either direct application of alcohol in vitro or acute high doses in vivo. In this study, we used our established moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) model, resulting in maternal blood alcohol content of approximately 20 mM, and subsequent ex vivo cell culture to assess expression of genes related to neurogenesis. Proliferating and differentiating neural progenitor cell culture conditions were established from telencephalic tissue derived from embryonic day (E) 15-17 tissue exposed to alcohol via maternal drinking throughout pregnancy. Gene expression analysis on mRNA derived in vitro was performed using a microarray, and quantitative PCR was conducted for genes to validate the microarray. Student's t tests were performed for statistical comparison of each exposure under each culture condition using a 95% confidence interval. Eleven percent of genes on the array had significantly altered mRNA expression in the prenatal alcohol-exposed neural progenitor culture under proliferating conditions. These include reduced expression of Adora2a, Cxcl1, Dlg4, Hes1, Nptx1, and Vegfa and increased expression of Fgf13, Ndn, and Sox3; bioinformatics analysis indicated that these genes are involved in cell growth and proliferation. Decreased levels of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a were also found under proliferating conditions. Under differentiating conditions, 7.3% of genes had decreased mRNA expression; these include Cdk5rap3, Gdnf, Hey2, Heyl, Pard6b, and Ptn, which are associated with survival and differentiation as indicated by bioinformatics analysis. This study is the first to use chronic low to moderate PAE, to more accurately reflect maternal alcohol consumption, and subsequent neural progenitor cell culture to demonstrate that PAE throughout gestation alters expression of genes involved in neural development and embryonic neurogenesis. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background The teratogenic effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy include anomalies of craniofacial structures derived from the cranial neural crest cells. The presence of specific craniofacial anomalies contributes to the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Cleft lip and palate [orofacial clefts (OFCs)], also derived from the cranial neural crest cells, are common congenital anomalies, but their relationship with prenatal alcohol consumption is unknown. Methods To evaluate the association between maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy and the occurrence of OFCs in infants, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of published studies. We examined the associations between any alcohol consumption, binge level drinking, and heavy and moderate levels of consumption vs. no or low levels of consumption. Results After screening 737 publications, we identified 33 studies (23 case-control and 10 cohort studies). There was considerable heterogeneity in individual study design, quality measures and study results. Findings from random effects meta-analyses suggest no relationship between prenatal alcohol consumption and the occurrence of OFCs {pooled odds ratios for any alcohol intake and binge level drinking respectively: cleft lip with or without cleft palate 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86, 1.16] from 18 349 participants in 13 studies, 1.04 [95% CI 0.87, 1.24] [8763 individuals, 4 studies]; cleft palate only 1.05 [95% CI 0.92, 1.21] [21 459 individuals, 17 studies], 0.94 [95% CI 0.74, 1.21] [7730 participants, 4 studies]}. Conclusions While we found no association between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and OFCs in infants, the influence of study design, particularly in relation to alcohol exposure measurement and OFC ascertainment cannot be ignored. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Seizures are observed with a frequency of 3-21% in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, clinical, neuroradiologic, and electroencephalography (EEG) features are poorly described. In this study, 13 patients with FASD and epilepsy or seizures were identified retrospectively from the databases of seven Italian pediatric neurology divisions. Eleven children were affected by epilepsy, and two had at least one documented seizure. Both generalized and focal seizures were observed. EEG showed diffuse or focal epileptic activity; two children developed electric status epilepticus during sleep (ESES). Structural brain anomalies, including polymicrogyria, nodular heterotopia, atrophy, and Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, were discovered in almost 50% of patients. Control of seizures was not difficult to obtain in 11 cases; one patient showed pharmacoresistant epilepsy. EEG and clinical follow-up are recommended in children with FASD and epilepsy, since severe conditions requiring aggressive treatment, such as in ESES, may develop. Neuroradiological evaluation is warranted because several types of brain anomalies could be associated with maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a prenatal disease characterized by fetal morphological and neurological abnormalities originating from exposure to alcohol. Although FAS is a well-described pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying its progression are virtually unknown. Moreover, alcohol abuse can affect vitamin metabolism and absorption, although how alcohol impairs such biochemical pathways remains to be elucidated. We employed a variety of systems chemo-biology tools to understand the interplay between ethanol metabolism and vitamins during mouse neurodevelopment. For this purpose, we designed interactomes and employed transcriptomic data analysis approaches to study the neural tissue of Mus musculus exposed to ethanol prenatally and postnatally, simulating conditions that could lead to FAS development at different life stages. Our results showed that FAS can promote early changes in neurotransmitter release and glutamate equilibrium, as well as an abnormal calcium influx that can lead to neuroinflammation and impaired neurodifferentiation, both extensively connected with vitamin action and metabolism. Genes related to retinoic acid, niacin, vitamin D, and folate metabolism were underexpressed during neurodevelopment and appear to contribute to neuroinflammation progression and impaired synapsis. Our results also indicate that genes coding for tubulin, tubulin-associated proteins, synapse plasticity proteins, and proteins related to neurodifferentiation are extensively affected by ethanol exposure. Finally, we developed a molecular model of how ethanol can affect vitamin metabolism and impair neurodevelopment. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a wide range of deficits in executive function that persist throughout life, but little is known about how changes in brain structure relate to cognition in affected individuals. In the current study, we predicted that the rate of white matter volumetric development would be atypical in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) when compared to typically developing children, and that the rate of change in cognitive function would relate to differential white matter development between groups. Data were available for 103 subjects [49 with FASD, 54 controls, age range 6-17, mean age = 11.83] with 153 total observations. Groups were age-matched. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an executive function (EF) battery. Using white matter volumes measured bilaterally for frontal and parietal regions and the corpus callosum, change was predicted by modeling the effects of age, intracranial volume, sex, and interactions with exposure status and EF measures. While both groups showed regional increases in white matter volumes and improvement in cognitive performance over time, there were significant effects of exposure status on age-related relationships between white matter increases and EF measures. Specifically, individuals with FASD consistently showed a positive relationship between improved cognitive function and increased white matter volume over time, while no such relationships were seen in controls. These novel results relating improved cognitive function with increased white matter volume in FASD suggest that better cognitive outcomes could be possible for FASD subjects through interventions that enhance white matter plasticity. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Among the toxins contained in tobacco, nicotine and carbon monoxide are the ones with negative effects on the body of the embryo or the fetus. They pass in the developing body of the baby thanks to placental circulation and causes unwanted effects. Alcohol is a physical and behavioral teratogen which is one of the main causes of mental retardation in the world. Human fetal exposure to alcohol during its embryonic and/or fetal period leads to the birth of a child with fetal alcohol syndrome, which includes: pre-and/or postnatal retard of global growth, characteristic facial dysmorphia, associated malformations, neurologic impairment with microcephaly. Materials & Methods: The research included 205 pregnant women who were hospitalized in "Elena Doamna" Clinical Hospital of Obstetrics- Gynecology Iasi, over a period of time of 5 years (2009-2013). During the research the following have been met: the ethical collaboration with other physicians involved in the management of these cases, a non discriminatory attitude, without unprofessional judgments, the confidentiality of medical documents and personal data, except the statistical data included in the study. The questionnaire filled by the patients aimed the identify the presence of some teratogenic risk factors for the evolution of pregnancy and for the new-born. The share of women who voluntary exposed themselves to a toxic teratogen during pregnancy showed: exposure to nicotine - 25.4%, alcohol - 9.8% and professional toxic - 5.4%. The epidemiological study was a prospective one, case-control type. The data was processed with SPSS 13.0 statistical techniques. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: Age distribution of pregnant women in the study group, shows a higher frequency of pregnant women aged 20-29 (52.2%), those living in towns (78%), married (93.2%). According to the cases studied 55% of the pregnant smokers had premature labour, and the children born by smoking mothers had an APGAR score<7 (26.9%) and also their weight under 2700 g (46.2%). 95% of the children with mother who drank alcohol during pregnancy, had their weight at birth under 2700 g, and 30% of them had an APGAR score57. Premature labour was identified for 36.4% of the patients exposed to toxic emissions. 27.3% of the children whose mothers were exposed to professional toxic substances during pregnancy were under 2700 g at birth and 9.1% of them had an APGAR score57. Conclusions: Complications during pregnancy (hypertension, gestational diabetes, complications), were significantly more in smoking patients (p<0.05). The relative risk of premature birth was over two times higher for pregnant smokers (RR = 2.25). 25% of patients exposed to alcohol and all the patients exposed to occupational pollutants had complications in pregnancy.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Alcohol use during pregnancy is one of the leading preventable causes of intellectual or developmental disability. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is the non-diagnostic umbrella term used to characterize the full range of damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. This situation clearly warrants intervention. Development of a focused, effective and evidence based intervention requires insight in the burden of FASD and the underlying dynamics. The current literature synthesis aims to provide the required evidence base by compiling the literature on FASD, specifically addressing what we know of the prevalence of FASD, which behaviors contribute to FASD, and which preventive measures have been recommended so far. Materials & Methods: A search was conducted in multiple electronic bibliographic databases up to April 2014, including PubMed, PsychInfo, PsychArticles, ERIC, CINAHL and EMBASE. A query was generated and the resulting hits were exported and screened by two independent screeners. All hits marked for inclusion by at least one screener were acquired, after which a second screening was conducted based on the full texts. Resulting articles will be examined to determine whether meta-analysis is feasible or whether a systematic review will be conducted. All materials, data, and analysis scripts will be made available publicly. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: n/a Conclusions: Results of the systematic literature search will be presented and specific recommendations for prevention efforts will be discussed.

N2  - Introduction: The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is an ongoing international collaboration of clinical and basic science researchers focused on improving the diagnosis and treatment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To assess genetic susceptibility to FASD, we first tested hypotheses of neuroteratogenic effects of candidate genes. The role of these genes was then tested using quantitative measures obtained from3-D facial images and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the candidate genes. Methods: Several genes were nominated for initial gene 9 alcohol exposure analyses. Genes in the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) pathways were identified using genetic screens in a zebrafishmodel. The Src family kinases (SFK) were implicated in studies showing that phosphorylation of L1 is necessary for ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion and that levels of SFK phosphorylation of L1 predict the severity of ethanol teratogenesis in C57BL/6mice. Analyses were performed in a sample of 101 children aged 8-18 years (mean 12.3) having 3D facial images andDNA. Analyses were limited toSNPs within +/- 15 kb of genes in the PGDF pathway (PDGFRAPDGFRB, PDGFB, PDGFC, and PDGFD) and in the Src kinase family (FYN, YES1, L1CAM, SRC). Landmarksweremanually placed to induce a dense correspondence of tens of thousands of points on the surfaces of 3D images. Principal components based on these points were used as facial shape phenotypes in a linear model to test for a SNP 9 alcohol exposure interaction, accounting for effects due to sex and age. Results: Overall width/length of the face were associated with SNPs in FYN (best p=3.1 x 10-6). The facial shape depicting hypertelorism and mandibular retraction was associated with SNPs in the 30 region of YES1 (best p=5.4 x 10-4) and in L1CAM (best p=7.4 x 10-5). Other facial shapes were associated with SNPs in PDGFC (best p=1.2 x 10-5) and with SNPs in PDGFRB (best p=9.8 x 10-4). There was modest association of facial shapes with SNPs in PDGFRA and PDGFD (best p=2.9 x 10-3). Conclusion: Several SNPs in candidate genes were significantly associated with facial shape variables, providing evidence that ethanol interacts with SFK and PDGF genes to induce variation in craniofacial phenotypes in humans exposed prenatally to alcohol.

N2  - Introduction: The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is an ongoing international collaboration of clinical and basic science researchers focused on the development of effective interventions and treatment approaches for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Prenatal alcohol exposure causes facial dysmorphismincluding shortened palpebral fissures, mid-facial hypoplasia, flat nasal bridge, smooth philtrum, and thin upper vermillion. 3D facial photographs capturing 25,000+ surface points are used to visualise and detect facial dysmorphism using a mathematical representation of 3D face shape that is also conducive to investigating candidate susceptibility genes. Methods: A small number of manually placed facial landmarks was used to induce a dense correspondence of tens of thousands of points on the face surfaces of 3D photographs of a study cohort of 101 individuals aged 8 to 18 years (mean 12.3). Following an alignment process, the average position of each densely corresponded point on the face surfaces was calculated to produce the average face shape of the cohort. A principal component analysis (PCA) of position difference of the densely corresponded points on the faces of cohortmembers from their position on the average face produced a set of PCAmodes capturing position correlations of the surface points ordered (high-tolow) according to the degree of shape variance they describe. Results: The contiguously generated PCA modes whose total coverage of shape variance was at least 99%, forming what is known as a dense surface model, were retained to synthesize the face shape of individual subjects and average faces of subgroups containing individuals with confirmed degrees of prenatal alcohol exposure as well as individuals without such exposure. A dense surface model was similarly constructed for the philtrum area alone. Conclusion: The resulting dense surface models were used to visualise and detect the face and philtrum shape differences between the alcohol exposed/unexposed subgroups. For this particular study, the set of PCA modes in the dense surface models also offered a very compactmulti-dimensional representation of each individual's face and philtrum, using only tens of PCAmodes, that was conducive to analysis along with genetic and alcohol exposure data in investigations of candidate susceptibility genes.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in children. Approximately half of pregnancies are unplanned and targeting both alcohol use and contraception in child-bearing age women is important for preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP). Methods: A dual-focused (i.e., alcohol use and contraception) brief physician intervention (DFBPI) was designed based on the brief intervention guidelines (Babor et al., 2007) and two evidence-based FASD prevention interventions (Fleming et al., 2008; Floyd et al., 2009) modified to be deliverable by OB/GYN physicians. The intervention consisted of two face-to-face, structured, 5-minute sessions incorporated in routine clinic visits. The intervention was evaluated in a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial in 20 district OB/GYN (women's) clinics in two locations in Russia, including St. Petersburg, a major urban city in North-West and the Nizhny Novgorod Region, a more rural centrally located area. Clinics were randomized to intervention or control/services as usual conditions. A total of 1,536 women were screened and 766 non-pregnant women, aged 18-44 years, at risk for an AEP (at-risk drinking and heterosexually active and inconsistently using contraception) were recruited for the study with follow-up at 3, 6, and 12-months. Results: The AEP risk reduced in both conditions with a stable time effect of approximately 50% of women in the entire sample not at AEP risk (40%among women with AUDIT >8). Across the followup period, the odds ratios of being at reduced risk for AEP were 1.4 fold greater in the intervention group at 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.89). The growthmodelling indicated a clinic effect, heterogeneity of paths to change, and an effect of the initial alcohol consumption level. Additional analyses that utilize person-centered approaches (e.g., growth mixture modeling) are necessary to account for individual change paths and alcohol consumption levels to evaluate individual variations and patterns of alcohol use and AEP risk changes. Conclusions: Results support the feasibility of the DFBPI at OBGYN clinics in Russia. Relatively small efforts such as assessment that includes asking women questions about their alcohol use and pregnancy possibility, achieve reductions of AEP risk among at-risk drinking childbearing women.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure resulting in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is the most common cause of neurodevelopmental impairments in the western world, with an estimated prevalence of 2- 5%. It is well established from studies in human, and rodent and Xenopus models of FASD that a single acute exposure to alcohol during the earliest stage of gastrulation is sufficient to induce the developmental defects associated with FAS. Our Vitamin A Hypothesis proposes that ethanol competitively interacts with the enzymes that normally would process retinol (Vitamin A) to retinoic acid (RA); and moreover, the resultant reduction of RA levels at this critical developmental stage can explain the neurodevelopmental defects of FAS at the molecular level. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we genetically engineered mice to express Cyp26A1-eGFP from the endogenous Goosecoid (Gsc) promoter. Overexpression of Cyp26A1 canmimic the effects of acute alcohol exposure by depleting the availability of RA; and the Gsc promoter will target expression specifically to the organizer region during early gastrulation. We report here that we have successfully derived mice with germline transmission of the Gsc:Cyp26A1-eGFP allele. RT-PCR analysis of the frontal face-brain region of E15-E16 embryos mice confirm expression of Cyp26A1 and eGFP in heterozygous mice in vivo. Gsc:Cyp26A1 F1 mice are born with an expected normal mendelian ratio of het:wt (0.95, n=127). This data indicates that Gsc:Cyp26A1, a dominant acting allele, does not severely impact overall development or viability (at least 6 months). Newborn F1mice were phenotypically assessed (blinded) for cranial-facial defects characteristic of FASD features that are well established in alcohol- treated mouse models (narrow and less well defined philtrum, compressed nasal passage area and flatter upper lip, compared to normal or untreated pups). Pups were later genotyped at weaning. Our analysis shows 88%(15/17) of mutant mice assessed had a discernable FAS phenotype. 100% of wild-typemice had been assessed as normal (14/14). Taken together, the data strongly supports that disregulation of RA signaling during early gastrulation can induce FAS-like cranio-facial developmental defects. The model will allow a full analysis of themolecular etiology of FASD and the therapeutic feasibility of new treatments to prevent or reduce ethanol-induced FASD.

N2  - As part of an evaluation of the State of Hawaii's Perinatal Support program for at-risk mothers, we examined the impact of services on the reduction of alcohol use during pregnancy to inform prevention efforts of the Hawaii Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Task Force. This study focused on ethnically diverse population in Hawaii, with a significant Asian and Pacific Islander population. Secondary data analysis was performed on a sample of 7,186 women whomwere enrolled in the program fromJuly 2007 to June 2012. Sociodemographic information, alcohol use, and other related behavioral risk factors were assessed at intake and subsequent trimester follow-ups. The mean age for participants was 25.6 years (sd=6.3). Of the sample, 9.6%were Caucasian, 5.5%Hispanic, 1.2%African American, 8.4%Asian, 15.9%Filipino, 22%Pacific Islanders (Micronesian), 7.5%other Pacific Islanders, 28.8% Native Hawaiian, and 1.1%Other. Overall, 9.6% of women screened positive or endorsed alcohol use at intake (regardless of trimester). There were significant differences in rates of alcohol use in the first trimester by ethnicity, where African American (18.9%), Native Hawaiian (17.5%), Filipino (13.1%), Caucasian (12.9%), Other (11.6%), and other Pacific Islanders (11.1%) weremore likely to endorse alcohol compared to Asian (6%), Hispanic (4.4%), and Pacific Islanders (Micronesian; 2.8%) (chi2 [9, n=3,708] 99.165, p<0.0001). Of a subset of women who were assessed in both first and second trimesters (n=2,494), 10.7%showed a reduction in alcohol risk, 3.3%continued to endorse alcohol use in the second trimester, and 1.3%newly endorsed alcohol use in the second trimester. From women who were also assessed in third trimester (n=1,942), of those who dropped alcohol use during the second trimester, 82.4%continued abstinence of alcohol use. Of the women who endorsed alcohol during the first and second trimesters, 38% stopped during the third trimester. These findings highlight the importance of prevention intervention programs in the reduction of alcohol use during pregnancy. Variation in alcohol by ethnicity suggests that ethnocultural differencesmay also be important for improving screening and intervention approaches.

N2  - This randomized trial evaluated effects of FASD education brochures on knowledge, attitudes, and alcohol consumption among childbearing age women in two regions in Russia. A total of 458 women (101 were pregnant and 357 non-pregnant) were recruited from women's clinics and randomly assigned to receiving: (1) a FASD education brochure with positive images and information stated in a positive way, positive group (PG); or (2) a FASD education brochure with negatively presented information, negative group (NG); or (3) a general healthmaterial, control group (CG). Face-to-face structured interviews to assess women's alcohol consumption, knowledge about FASD, and attitudes were conducted at baseline and at a one-month follow-up. The interview utilized internationally-recognized measures and was pilot tested prior to implementation. NIH definitions of women's at-risk drinking were utilized. Quantile regression, McNemar's and Fisher's tests were performed. This presentation aimed at identification of effects of FASD education brochures on women's alcohol consumption. A high proportion of women in this sample were at-risk because of their binge drinking. The three groups/study conditions did not differ in proportions of at-risk drinkers at baseline. There was a significant decrease in alcohol consumption between baseline and one-month follow-up in all three study conditions. The effect was higher in both experimental conditions (PG and NG) compared to CG and in PG compared to NG. As indicated by risk ratio coefficients in all three study conditions, women who were at-risk drinkers at baseline were less likely to change their alcohol use and more likely to sustain at-risk alcohol consumption at follow-up. Participation in the study and answering questions about alcohol consumption had an intervention effect and led to a reduction of alcohol consumption in both experimental and control conditions. Receiving a FASD education brochure was associated with a higher reduction in the proportion of atrisk drinking women at follow-up compared to women who received a general health information brochure. The reduction was higher among women who received a brochure with positive images and positively stated information. The study indicated that providing FASD education brochures, particularly brochures with positively presented information, has a significant effect on alcohol use among women.

N2  - Following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), a complex pattern of impairments in cognition, self-regulation, and adaptive functioning are observed, which correspond with alterations in brain structure. However, little is known about how white matter connectivity among regions is altered by PAE. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique that allows for assessment of white matter tract integrity by measuring restriction of water diffusion, known as fractional anisotropy (FA). During development, both FA and myelination of tracts increase, and FA likely reflects in part the degree of myelination. Evidence from rodent and human studies suggests that myelination is reduced by PAE; however, little is known about how PAE alters whitemattermicrostructure along major tracts. DTI images were obtained in FASD and Control adolescents (n=48, 8-18 yrs, X=13+/-2 years,48% female) as part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD). Alongtract statistics were utilized to investigate integrity of white matter at specific points along 9 major tracts across boys and girls, controlling for multiple Point by Tract comparisons at p<0.05. Similar to previous findings, an overall decrease in whole brain FA was observed among adolescents with FASD compared to Control counterparts (p=0.014). This effect was driven largely by lower FA in the right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and right corticospinal tract (CST) (p's<0.0001) and a similar statistical trend for the left CST (p=0.004). An overall increase in number of streamlines comprising the tracts was observed between FASD compared to Control adolescents (p=0.003), and this effect was predominantly observed in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO) (p=0.001). These novel results identify specific points along white matter tracts that may be more vulnerable to the effects of PAE. The present findings have implications for understanding cognitive and behavioral alterations commonly observed among adolescents with a FASD that specifically implicate connections between the: 1) thalamus and prefrontal cortex (ATR), or 2) motor system and spinal tract (CST). Future research will investigate the sexually dimorphic effects of PAE on structural connectivity and associated cognitive deficits. These findings, which demonstrate specific alterations related to PAE, could potentially enhance future interventions.

N2  - Because prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with growth deficiency, very little attention has been paid to the potentially high prevalence of overweight and obesity in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) compared to the population as a whole. This study examined the prevalence of overweight/obesity in a large representative clinical sample of children and adolescents with FASD and sought to identify characteristics associated with increased risk for obesity in these individuals. Children, ages 2 to 19 years, who were evaluated for FASD at University Clinics included 446 participants with an FASD diagnosis and 171 participants with no-FASD diagnosis. The prevalence of overweight/obesity (BMI >85 percentile) was compared to national and state prevalence rates. BMI was examined in relation to FASD diagnosis, gender, age, and behavior regulation. Dietary intake data was also examined for a young sub-sample (n=42). Thirty-four percent of children and adolescents with any FASD diagnosis were overweight or obese, which did not differ fromthe prevalence among U.S. children or among the no-FASD group. However, high rates of overweight/obesity were seen in those with Partial FAS diagnoses (40%). In addition, adolescents (ages 13 to 19) with any FASD diagnosis had elevated rates (42%), particularly among females (50%). The rate of overweight/obesity in adolescent females with FASD was nearly three times higher than the state prevalence for adolescent females (17-18%), p<0.001. Poor behavioral regulation on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function and increased impulsivity on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test-II were correlated with higher BMI. In the young subsample, low effortful control on the Child Behavior Questionnaire was correlated with dietary fat intake, r=-0.33, p=0.033. Overweight and obesity are common in adolescents with FASD (particularly in females), in those with a Partial FAS diagnosis, and in those with poor behavior control. These data suggest that clinicians treating patients with FASD should consider dietary and other interventions for the highest-risk individuals.

N2  - This study seeks to determine the extent and duration of alcohol use that occurs while breastfeeding, and the effect that alcohol exposure via breast milk may have on the offspring. Maternal risk factor data were collected in theWestern Cape Province of South Africa from 1,294 mothers of first grade students in four, large, in-school study samples of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among first graders enrolled in 60 primary schools in five communities. The maternal subjects of the study are the mothers of children: 1) who were diagnosed with a specific diagnosis within the continuum of FASD, or 2) who were randomly-selected as candidates for a control/comparison group and their child was not diagnosed with an FASD or another known anomaly. Overall, 89.4% of all mothers in these communities breastfed these children for a mean duration of 19.8 months. Most mothers of children with an FASD breastfed (91.4%) for an average of 21.3 months as did 84.4%ofmothers of the controls for an average of 18.7 months; these differences were not statistically significantly different. Eighty-eight percent of the mothers of children with an FASD, 85.7%of the mothers of the prenatally- alcohol-exposed normal controls, and 29.4%of the mothers of prenatally unexposed controls reported drinking while breastfeeding. The mothers of children with an FASD who drank while breastfeeding had significantly higher reported drinking levels than the drinking mothers of the control children. Children with an FASD diagnosis who had also been exposed to alcohol via breastmilk had significantly more dysmorphology than those with FASD who were not exposed to alcohol in the breast milk (16.5 vs. 14.6, t=2.68, p=0.009). Among the controls, there is no significant difference in total dysmorphology based on alcohol exposure via breastmilk (8.4 vs. 7.8, t=0.78, p=0.438). Adjusting for maternal physical characteristics, demographics, pregnancy variables, and drinking during pregnancy (strong covariates of an FASD diagnosis), sequential logistic regression analysis indicated thatmothers who drank alcohol while breastfeeding were 6.5 times more likely to have a child with an FASD diagnosis than weremothers who did not drink during the breastfeeding period (B=1.863, p=0.011, OR=6.446).

N2  - This study will determine if there is a difference in maternal risk factors and the prevalence and severity of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) for mothers who live and work on farms versus those of mothers who work on farms but live in nearby towns in theWestern Cape Province (WCP) of South Africa (ZA). FASD occur when a foetus is exposed to substantial amounts of alcohol in the prenatal period, especially through maternal binge drinking. In five study communities of the WCP, the prevalence of FASD reportedmost recently is 13.5%to 20.8%, the highest prevalence documented anywhere in the world. Epidemiology studies in theWCP have found that farm workers generally have the poorest socio-economic circumstances, high fertility, poor nutrition, and the most regular and heavy patterns of binge drinking during pregnancy. Each of these factors increases the risk of bearing a child with an FASD, and not coincidentally, the highest rates of FASD have been found among farm workers. The majority of farm workers have traditionally been residents on farms where they work; however, recent residential trends are changing, and it is now more common for a higher proportion of farm workers to live in near-by towns. Although the living circumstances of many farm workers have increased notably during the past years, a substantial number of farm workers have lost their permanent jobs and homes on farms andmoved to towns. Some female farm workers may live in dire circumstances, for many are now seasonal workers with no job security or benefits, and access to alcohol may be greater for those living in the towns. Others who have moved to the towns may be forming new patterns of living and norms that will protect their offspring from alcohol exposure and therefore FASD-related disabilities. A collaborative research teamfromthe USA and ZA have researched the epidemiology of FASD over the past 16 years, and can now ask: how do these residence patterns influence maternal risk for, and rates of, FASD? The accumulated data sets for 6,767 children and 2,625 of their mothers will be analysed to compare differential patterns and factors of maternal risk (e.g. quantity, frequency, and timing of alcohol use, childbearing, and socioeconomic), specific indicators of child outcome (dysmorphology and cognitive/behavioural), and differential diagnoses of FASD for farm workers living in towns versus on farms.

N2  - This study was launched to determine the prevalence of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the characteristics and traits of children with FASD, normal controls, and their mothers in the general population of a rural area of the Western Cape Province (WCP) of South Africa (ZA). The epidemiology of FASD has been well studied and described in the extant literature for the more urban/small city, western portion of theWCP close to the Cape Town metropolitan area. In those previous studies of first grade children, extremely extremely high rates of FASD have been reported: fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) rates of 59 to 91 per 1,000, and total FASD rates of 13.5 to 20.7%. Also in previous studies, the prevalence of FASD was highest in the rural areas surrounding the small cities, as low socioeconomic status (SES), insufficient nutrition, high fertility, and norms supporting heavy binge drinking are common among a substantially higher portion of the rural, childbearing population. This new, in-school study of first grade children and their mothers was undertaken in four, previously unstudied, rural communities of theWCP that are substantially farther away andmore isolated from Cape Town. Geographically, socially and economically isolated, SES is lower in these rural, agricultural communities where alcohol consumption among men and women is believed to be more prevalent and severe than in most communities in ZA. There were 1870 first grade students enrolled, 1062 of whomentered the full study via: 1) height, weight and/or head circumference <25th centile, 2) random selection as candidates for controls (if they were not eventually diagnosed in the study as having an FASD or another anomaly), or 3) teacher referral. Following dysmorphology examination, cognitive/behavioral testing, and risk factor interview of the mothers, final Institute of Medicine diagnoses were made: FAS=173; PFAS=109; ARND=59; and ARBD=0. Detailed group comparisons of children with a specific diagnosis within the FASD continuum with controls (those prenatally exposed to alcohol and those not exposed) will be presented for physical dysmorphology and cognitive/behavioral traits. Alcohol use and other traits and behaviors of the maternal groups will also be described and linked to child diagnoses. The prevalence of FASD in these rural communities is very high: FAS occurs in 92.5 to 162.9 per 1,000 children and total FASD affects 18.2%to 32.1%.

N2  - Whereas children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS) exhibit distinctive facial dysmorphology, the term alcohol-related neurodevelopomental disorders (ARND) is applied to prenatally-exposed individuals who exhibit neurobehavioral deficits while lacking this dysmorphology. In an attempt to improve identification of ARND in a well-characterized Cape Coloured sample, Suttie et al. (2013) applied a dense surfacemodel approach to 3D photographs, in which sparse landmarks induced a correspondence of thousands of points to capture subtle shape differences. For themore heterogeneous heavily exposed (HE) nondysmorphic phenotype, a novel clustering technique, shape signature graph analysis, was used, which involved normalizing face shape with respect to a control group and connecting individuals with themost similar facial dysmorphism. Signature graph analysis identified about half of the nonsyndromal HE group as having facial dysmorphism similar to the children with FAS and PFAS compared to healthy controls (the "HE1 group"), whereas the others were more similar to the controls ("HE2"). 161 children (17 FAS, 23 PFAS, 59 HE nonsyndromal, 62 controls) from this Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort were assessed on theWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (4th Ed; WISC-IV) and the California Verbal Learning Task (CVLT) at 9 years. Their mothers had been interviewed during pregnancy to determine their alcohol consumption using a timeline follow-back interview. The children were examined at 5 years by three expert dysmorphologists for fetal alcohol-related anomalies and growth impairment. WISC IQ was related to diagnostic group in a dose-dependent fashion. On theWISC-IV Verbal Comprehension Index and the CVLT, the scores in the HE1 group were similar to those in the FAS and PFAS groups, whereas the HE2 group's performance resembled that of the controls. The HE1 and HE2 groups did not differ, however, on the three otherWISC-IV indices-Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed, or on alcohol-related eyeblink conditioning. These data suggest that the subtle facial dysmorphology differences revealed by the Suttie et al. dense surface analysis are related specifically to deficits in the verbal domain, possibly due to effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on underlying frontal lobe structure and function that may mediate effects on verbal performance.

N2  - Purpose of study: Neurobehavioral problems may manifest differently over a range of ages in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We previously found that school teachers in a South African region reported significant behavior problems in learners with FASD aged 6 and 10 years compared to typically developing controls. This study aimed to examine the behavioral profile of an older (adolescent) age-band of prenatally alcohol-exposed children in the same regional setting. Methods: Participants were children with prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) (n=56) and no or minimal alcohol exposure (CON) (n=62). Participants were recruited from a previous epidemiological study in this high risk community in the Western Cape Province. As part of a multisite CIFASD study, children's teachers completed the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) teacher report form (TRF), rating behavior Symptom Scales including: anxiety/depression (ANX/DEP), social problem (SOC), internalizing (INT) and obsessive compulsive (OCD) symptoms and DSM-oriented conditions: affect (AFF), anxiety (ANX), somatic (SOM), inattention (INATT), hyperactivity/ impulsivity (HYPER-IMP), ADHD, oppositional defiant (OD) and conduct problems (CD). Mean age at TRF assessment was 14.9 yr (S.D=0.64). Data were analyzed using ANOVA and dependent outcomes were covaried for age, sex and IQ. The relationship between maternal drinking in pregnancy and TRF scores was measured with Spearman correlations. Results: Teachers rated the ALC group as having significantly more problems in most TRF domains. After covariant analysis, there remained significant effects of group on ANX/DEP, SOC and INT symptoms and INATT, AFFECT, ANX and OCD DSM-oriented conditions. Bivariate correlations were significant between maternal alcohol consumption (first trimester drinks per day and occurrence of binge drinking) and higher ratings of problem behaviors. Conclusion: A range of significant problem behaviors in South African children with prenatal alcohol exposure persist into adolescence. Not all behaviorally affected alcohol-exposed children meet clinical diagnostic criteria for FASD. These findings have implications for early recognition of children at risk and development of relevant educational and classroom behavior support strategies.

N2  - The goal of this study is to develop diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) that can be used in infancy and very early childhood. FASD occur when fetuses are exposed to alcohol in the prenatal period via maternal drinking, usually through heavy, binge drinking. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most clinically recognizable formof FASD and is characterized by a pattern of minor facial anomalies, prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, and functional or structural central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. However, diagnosis of FAS in the infancy and early-childhood period is difficult and no clear criteria have been established for an early childhood diagnosis. The highest documented population prevalence of FAS in the world is 80 per 1,000 in themixed race population of theWestern Cape Province in South Africa. The consequences of FASD are lifelong, thus, early diagnosis and referral for early intervention services are imperative. However, while application of diagnostic guidelines for FASD in older children and adolescents can be difficult, diagnosis in the infant is rarely attempted because of the lack of documented specificity of the phenotype in the newborn. Yet, identification and referral within the first few months of lifemay represent the most crucial time in the affected child's life for initiation of early intervention services. A collaborative team of researchers from Stellenbosch University, The University of North Carolina, Sanford Research and The University of New Mexico have been following children from the newborn period to 60 months of age to determine the dysmorphology and developmental trajectories that characterize the alcoholexposed population in this stage of life (N=140). We are using three methodologies to approach this issue: growth and standardized dysmorphology assessment of subjects and controls at birth, 6 weeks, and 9 18, 42 and 60 months respectively; standardized developmental assessments (using age appropriate assessment tools) at the same intervals; and digital photography at each interval. This poster will present the results of our study of the children up to 18 months of age. The results consistently show slower developmental progress among alcohol-exposed children and variable dysmorphology over the time increments. Examination of the cohort continues at the above regular time intervals until the children reach the age of 60 months.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt development, leading to physical, neuropathological, and cognitive disorders. In a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), these effects can be reduced by treatment with choline, a precursor in the one-carbon metabolic cycle that generates s-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). DNA methyltransferases require SAMas a methyl donor for de novo cytosine methylation, and choline supplementation alters local and global DNA cytosine methylation patterns. To better understand cellular responses to ethanol in the developing nervous system, and how these responses might be mitigated by choline, rat prefrontal cortices were studied. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups in a 2 (EtOH, sham) x 2 (choline chloride, vehicle) design. Alcohol (5.25 g/kg/day) was administered by intragastric intubation at postnatal days (PD) 4-9; choline (100 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection at PD 4-30. Tissue was collected on PD 31. The early (PD 4-9) postnatal development of the rat brain models the third trimester of human fetal brain development. Methylated DNA from prefrontal cortex tissue was captured by a methyl binding protein approach (ActiveMotif Methyl Collector Ultra). Greater than 200 million DNA fragments were sequenced for each group and methylome features analyzed using the CLC Bio Genome Workbench (version 6.5b3). Results: Comparing global DNA methylation patterns by scatter, Q-Q, volcano plots, antibodybased fluorescent assays, and LINE-1 pyrosequencing, we observed high correlation between treatment groups. However, when we queried genomic regions 10 kilobases upstream and downstream of the transcriptome transcription start site, we identified hypermethylated and hypomethylated loci in the different treatment groups. Using a modified gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to group changes in genic DNA methylation into molecular pathways, we detected alcohol-induced and choline-modified DNAmethylation changes at genes involved in acetylcholine signaling, retinoidmetabolism, and others. Discussion: This genomic view of brain methylome in the developing rat exposed to alcohol and choline suggests an important role for retinoid signaling in FASD, and also implicates several other gene networks. These data identify genetic targets through which prenatal alcohol might alter development, as well as choline's modification of gene expression.

N2  - Insult to the CNS is accompanied by a graded response in which glia become activated. The molecular and phenotypic changes in activated microglia are increasingly understood and can now be applied to better understand the consequences of alcohol consumption. Maternal consumption of alcohol can lead to widespread neuropathology in the developing fetal brain. Using the neonatal mousemodel of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), characterized by significant neuronal loss and long term behavioral deficits, we previously demonstrated that microglia are highly vulnerable targets of ethanol pathogenesis in the developing brain. Specifically, ethanol exposure causes loss of microglial cells and the surviving microglia express morphological changes suggestive of microglial activation and neuroinflammation. In addition, we demonstrated that neuroprotective and antiinflammatory pharmaceutical PPAR-c agonists can block ethanol pathogenesis in both neurons and microglia. The present study analyzed cytokine and chemokine expression in this model to determine both the graded stage and molecular consequences of ethanol-induced microglial activation in the developing brain. Further, we determined whether treatment with the PPAR-c agonist pioglitazone would prevent ethanol-induced pathogenic changes in gene expression. Mice were treated with 4 g/kg ethanol by gavage on postnatal days (PD) 4-9. Animals received either water or pioglitazone by gavage on PD3-9. On PD10, animals were perfused to remove blood from the brain vasculature and the brain was microdissected. Analysis of gene expression revealed that ethanol induced expression of IL-1beta, TNF-a, and CCL2 (MCP-1) mRNA in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Treatment with pioglitazone completely prevented the ethanol-induced increase in cytokine and chemokine expression. These findings shed light on an important new potential mechanism underlying the neuropathology of FASD. First, expression of these specific cytokines and chemokines indicates that ethanol exposure in the developing brain produces a stage of microglial activation associated with major CNS insult and neurodegeneration. Second, these molecules are pro-inflammatory, as well as neurotoxic and gliotoxic, and thus likely contribute to the neuropathology of FASD. Finally, the FDA-approved pharmaceutical agent pioglitazone holds promise to intervene in the neuropathological consequences of FASD.

N2  - Lifelong social behavior deficits can serve as a unifying feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Social behavior deficits following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) becomemore pronounced prior to and during adolescence, a critical period of social behavior development. PAE is known to reprogram the stress systemsuch that PAE offspring are hyper-responsive to stressors, and exhibit increased drive and deficits in feedback. The functional relationship between the stress system and brain areas important for regulating social behavior suggests that alterations to the stress system are a source of observed PAE-related social behavior deficits. We investigated social behavior using a test of social learning in PAE and control rats. Pregnant rat dams were assigned to: 1) PAE: access to liquid ethanol diet ad libitum; 2) Pair-Fed: access to liquid control diet yoked to consumption of a PAE partner; or 3) Control: access to control diet ad libitum. Periadolescent offspring (~P30) were evaluated using a social recognition test. The learning phase of the test involves four 2-min sessions (18-min intertrial interval) during which the same social stimulus is introduced into the testing apparatus. A fifth, 2-min session with a novel social stimulus serves as the test phase. Time spent in investigation and specific social behaviors were recorded. Blood was collected for analysis of the stress hormone corticosterone and corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG). Preliminary data indicate PAE males show impairments in social recognition. Animals habituated to the familiar social stimulus, as measured by decreases in latency to initiate play over the learning phase. PAE males showed no change in latency to initiate play with the novel social stimulus, whereas control males showed a significant increase in play latency. PAE animals also showed divergent patterns of play behavior. These results demonstrate that PAE alters social recognition memory in early adolescence andmodifies normal social behavior. Additionally, we found no difference in levels of corticosterone, though increased levels of CBG were observed in PAE and Pair-Fed animals, indicating less free corticosterone in these animals and altered HPA activity. Changes in the stress system may underlie some of the social behavior deficits observed in PAE animals.

N2  - Recent experiments in our laboratory indicate that moderate fetal ethanol exposure(FAE) results in reductions in measures of dendritic morphology in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. The current experiments were undertaken to further establish a link between FAE, structure and function in the NAc, and voluntary alcohol consumption in adulthood. Moderate FAE was achieved using a two-bottle choice voluntary consumption paradigm. Dams received either 0 or 5%ethanol in saccharin throughout gestation, resulting in blood ethanol concentrations around 82 mg/dL. At sixmonths of age, male offspring were individually housed and given 4-hour access to two bottles containing either 20%ethanol or tap water. Immediately following ethanol consumption, rats were sacrificed and NActissue was processed for either immediate-early gene expression or Golgi-Cox staining. Using RT-PCR, the expression ofc-fos, Arc, and Homer1a were measured. No significant effects were found for Arc or c-fos expression in either the NAc core or shell between FAE and saccharinexposed control rats. There was a significant reduction in Homer1a expression in the NAc core, but not the shellof FAE rats. It was also found that NAc core Arc expression was negatively correlated with ethanol consumption in saccharin controls, but not in FAE animals.Measures of dendritic morphology found significant reductions in the core and shell for dendritic branching and length, as well as reduced spine density, in FAE rats. Reductions in the shell for all animals and in the core for FAE rats predicted ethanol consumption, with reduced dendritic branching associated with increased ethanol consumption. Two further experiments found no significant differences between FAE and control rats for ethanol metabolismor general reward learning using an operant intracranial selfstimulation paradigm. These results suggest that alcohol consumption by adult rats exposed tomoderate levels of ethanol in utero may lead to structural and functional alterations in the NAc core, and that these changes, combined with pre-existing deficits in the NAc shell,may partially explain the deficits in reward-guided learning and behavior in these animals.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can result in enduring severe cognitive deficits and characteristic facial features. A growing body of literature suggests that even moderate PAE can result in long lasting cognitive deficits exemplified in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, including impairments in learning and memory, social behavior and executive function. Executive function describes a broad range of cortically mediated behaviors including behavioral flexibility, which has been shown to be a sensitive and reliablemeasure across species. High dose of PAE has been shown to impair flexible behavior, but the effects of moderate PAE on this cognitive process have not been examined. Further, themechanisms that underlie the executive function deficits associated with FASD are still unclear. In order to investigate the effects of moderate PAE on executive control, we utilized a voluntary drinking paradigm where dams had access to a saccharine sweetened 10%alcohol solution for 4 hours, during the dark cycle, throughout gestation. Pups of alcohol and saccharine only (SAC) exposed dams were then tested on a visual pair-wise discrimination reversal touch-screen operant task during adulthood. PAE animals were not impaired in discriminative learning, butmade significantly more perseverative errors during choice shifting in the early phase of reversal (<20% correct). Further analysis of perseverative errors during early reversal revealed differences in the length of time spent in the perseverative phase between PAE and SAC mice. Across species reversal learning is mediated by orbital frontal cortex (OFC), therefore, we performed in vivo electrophysiology in the OFC of PAE and SACmice to examine whether alterations in cortical firing may underlie the behavioral deficit. Results showed a difference in phasic firing in the OFC of PAE animals specifically during early reversal, when choice shifting is occurring. Given the well-established role of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in synaptic plasticity and previous work showing alterations ofNMDAR subunits in the hippocampus after PAE, we are currently investigating if alterations in NMDA receptor function and expression are possiblemechanisms behind the alteration in cortical firing. Together our data demonstrate a long lasting impairment in executive function after moderate PAE that may result from alterations in cortical firing.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol SpectrumDisorders (FASD) are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) and believed responsible for the majority of developmental disabilities in the U.S. Our objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral for Treatment (SBIRT) interventionmay reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) women in Southern California. Southern California AI/AN women of childbearing age completed a survey including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use, were randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former completed an on-line SBIRT intervention, and were followed-up at 1, 3, and 6 months post-intervention. of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, a third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior and risk of AEP in the followup period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Factors associated with decreased risk included the baseline perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per week, a greater number of binge episodes in the past two weeks, and depression. Participation in this study may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the web-based intervention. The importance of perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/ functionality have implications for future interventions.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a broad term used to describe individuals exposed prenatally to alcohol and encompasses a broad range of birth defects including facial abnormalities and learning,motor, and behavioral deficits. Despite promoting alcohol abstinence during pregnancy, the incidenceof FASD has failed to declineand individuals lackingcardinal facial abnormalities and historical exposure are increasingly difficult to identify. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is readily available, provides superior brain contrast, and in previous human studies of FASD hasshownsignificant volume reductions in various brain structures.We hypothesize that postnatal MRI derived volumetric brain measurements can predict prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant ewes received 2.5 g/kg alcohol (N=8) IV three consecutive days per week fromgestation day 4-41 (mimicking a binge drinking pattern in the first trimester of pregnancy) while remaining ewes were controls (N=7). Lambs were sacrificed at 6 months of age, their brains were perfused with fixative, and MRI's were performed immediately post mortem.T1-weighted images were used to calculate cerebellar and pituitary volume(ITK-SNAP software, Version 2.4.0). Corrected mean cerebellar volume to total brain weight in controls(10.03+/-0.2328 g) was significantly different from the alcohol group (9.27+/-0.1305 g) (p<0.05) while corrected mean pituitary volume to total brain weight in controls (207.44+/-26.25 g) did not differ significantly from the alcohol group (180.63+/-8.106 g) (p=0.3175). TheseMRI findings differ fromour previous workutilizing stereological methods on the fetal cerebellumand the same first trimester alcohol exposure. The total estimated cerebellar Purkinje cell number andPurkinje cell density decreased significantlyin the alcohol group compared to thecontrol group but no significant differences existed between cerebellar volumes. Findings in the pituitary are consistent with previous rodent literature in which no significant volume differences were identified. Pituitary volume is therefore a poor predictor of first trimester alcohol exposureat this alcohol dose and pattern in sheep, but MRI derived volumetric measures of the cerebellum or other brain structures may be beneficial and further studies are warranted.

N2  - Early detection of alcohol use among pregnant women is critical to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Maternal self-reporting is largely unreliable and the utility of current biomarkers is also limited during pregnancy. Based on alcohol's complex effects on the transferrin N-glycans including loss of sialic acids, partial loss of sugars, and/or complete loss of oligosaccharide chains, we herein utilized state of the art mass spectrometry to characterize the sequences and abundances of maternal plasma transferrin N-linked oligosaccharides preserving the location of the N-glycosite in a pregnant rat binge alcohol paradigm model. We utilized a once-daily binge alcohol exposure paradigm (4 or 6 g/kg ethanol, intragastric gavage) for two weeks till gestational day 20. Blood sample (200 ll) was drawn into a heparinized vial at peak blood alcohol concentration time, plasma separated and utilized formass spectrometric studies. Protein identification and sequence mapping was followed by glycopeptide identification using the diagnostic fragmentation spectra. Absolute glycopeptide quantitation was performed. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed the composition, sequences, and abundances of rat maternal plasma transferrin N-linked oligosaccharides preserving the location of the N-glycosite. The abundances of several N-linked oligosaccharides were dosedependently altered with knock out of some moieties at the higher alcohol dose. These studies may pave way for developing highly sensitive protein post-translational modification signature profile directly relating to the dose and duration of exposure. We believe that these novelmethodologies can be in the future extended to pregnant women and form the basis for a high throughput screening tool that will help establish a standardized diagnostic criteria with a real clinical impact not only in diagnosis but also in treatment and prevention.

N2  - This study is a collaboration between theMotherisk Program and the University of British Columbia School of Population and Public Health, which collected meconium samples in Uganda to measure the prevalence of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during pregnancy. The focus of our study is to measure the frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure by meconium fatty-acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) analysis. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) describes a range of lifelong neurodevelopment impairments originating frommaternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Recent studies determined that of the Ugandan women who drank regularly prior to pregnancy, 18.3%reported abstinence, 68.3% decreased alcohol consumption, whereas an astonishing 11.1%reported increases in alcohol consumption. The number of FASD cases in parts of sub-Saharan Africa has been increasing, which is a cause for concern due to the socio-economic impact. The increase in FASD cases may be linked to the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy (2.2%-87%). FAEEs have served as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. Meconiumwas collected from 505 newborns between October-November 2013 atMbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Each meconium sample was attached to a questionnaire, which contained maternal and neonatal information. The questionnaires will serve as the maternal self-report for alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The criterion used to describe a positivemeconium FAEE test, which confirms excessive alcohol consumption during 2nd and/or 3rd trimester, are when the total FAEE concentration (sum of ethyl palmitate, oleate, stearate and linoleate concentrations) is greater than 2 nmol/g. All samples are analyzed by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction followed by GC/MS analyses. Meconium FAEE analysis is currently ongoing at Motherisk Laboratory. The identification of specific populations (i.e. Uganda) in need of basic epidemiologic research on the prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure is urgently required in order to create awareness and reduce the devastation of FASD.

N2  - While direct ethanol metabolites including ethyl glucuronide (EtG) play an important role for the confirmation of ethanol consumption, their utility is often limited by their short half-lives in blood and urine. Maternal hair might allow for a retrospectivemeasure of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) for up to severalmonths. Prior studies yieldedmixed results with respect to the utility of hair EtG (hEtG) in pregnant women. This study examined the validity of hEtG relative to self-reporting and five other biomarkers (gamma glutamyltranspeptidase [GGT], carbohydrate-deficient transferrin [CDT], urine ethyl glucuronide [uEtG], urine ethyl sulfate [uEtS], and phosphatidylethanol [PEth]) in 103 pregnant women. Patients were recruited from a UNM prenatal clinic and followed until the early postpartum period. The composite index, which was based on self-reported measures of alcohol use and allowed us to classify subjects into PAE (n=47) and control (n=56) groups, was the criterion measure used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of hEtG and other biomarkers. Proximal segments of hair were collected at enrollment (average 21.0 gestational weeks) and sent to a contract laboratory for analysis by LCMS/ MS. At the same visit,maternal specimens were collected for analysis of GGT and%dCDTin serum, urine EtG and EtS (uEtG, uEtS), and whole blood PEth. The pregnant population included a large proportion of ethnic minorities (76.7%Latina, 9.7% Native American, 3.9%African American) who were socially disadvantaged (51.5%< high school education; 99% Medicaid/no health insurance). Themeanmaternal age at recruitment was 26.6+/-5.1 years. Hair EtG demonstrated a 19.2%sensitivity and 87.5%specificity. The sensitivities of other biomarkers were comparable (6.7-20.0%) to hEtG in this cohort, but specificities were higher (98.2-100%). Of the five subjects positive for three or more biomarkers at enrollment, only two had hEtG levels greater than the limit of detection, and those concentrations were low (8 and 13 pg/mg). Mothers of two children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome had hEtG levels of 158 and 58 pg/mg. Combining hEtG with other biomarkers resulted in a substantial increase in the sensitivity to 44.7%with a slight decrease in specificity to 80.4%.These data suggest that given its lower specificity compared with other ethanol biomarkers, hEtG should not be used as a sole biomarker for identification of prenatal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol SpectrumDisorder (FASD) is an umbrella term used to describe the range of disabilities and diagnoses that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure. While alcohol teratogenesis generally results in diffuse brain alterations, the functional patterns of disability that result seem to vary patient to patient. To our knowledge, no actual data exists from more than specific research studies or single clinical programs that note the frequency of each co-occurring functional disorder nor identifies the common clusters of functional disorders. Similarly, diagnostic clinics may makemany treatment recommendations at the end of the FASD assessment process for health, mental health, social services, education, and others, but there has not been any published work that informs the ability to make meaningful interpretations of the diagnoses and disorders, as well as tomake recommendations for the most effective interventions. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop a database that would enable the collection of FASD diagnostic data across Canada in order to analyze and clearly document the common problems-and recommended treatments-associated with FASD. Importantly, the universal data form project provides a platform for standardized data collection. Methods: The data form was developed using a set of common forms and data was collected from over 30 participating FASD diagnostic teams in Canada. To date, the FASDataform Project has captured over 350 client records and initial data analysis reveals interesting patterns of functional diagnoses. The top three functional deficits were in the areas of adaptive behaviour (83%), executive function and abstract reasoning (81%), and social Communication (78%). The most frequent patterns of functional deficits were 'academic achievement, executive function, communication' (58%) and 'cognition, Executive function and Adaptive behaviour' (58%). Variations among provincial experiences and atypical functional clusters will also be discussed. Conclusion: This is the first clinical dataset for FASD that has provided identification of trends and modalities related to prevention, prevalence and diagnosis of FASD across jurisdictional lines. This data accurately reflects the pan-Canadian FASD diagnostic clinical experience. These data can be used for reporting, research and surveillance; as well as informing best practices and policy.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancymay lead to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Although models of IUGR exhibit altered uterine vascular adaptations, nothing is known about the effects of alcohol on uterine artery reactivity. We herein hypothesized that chronic binge-alcohol exposure during pregnancy impairs uterine vascular adaptations via the nitric oxide (NO) vasodilatory system. A chronic once daily binge alcohol paradigm was followed in the rats (6 g/kg; intragastric gavage; gestation day (GD) 5-19). Experiments were conducted on GD 20. A significant reduction in fetal whole body weight and crown-rump length was observed following alcohol exposure. Alcohol did not alter uterine artery contractility in response to a1 adrenergic agonist phenylephrine and thromboxane or vasodilatory response to endothelium-independent sodium-nitroprusside. Alcohol selectively impaired endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-induced uterine vascular relaxation (EMax, Ctrl, 94.7+/-1.6; Alc, 69.7+/-1.7; p<0.001). Alcohol-induced Ach-mediated impaired vasorelaxation was due to NO pathway because addition of inhibitors of prostacyclin and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor activity demonstrated a significant NO component (EMax, Ctrl, 65.8+/-2.4; Alc, 47.3+/-1.4; p<0.001). Addition of NO-related inhibitors (L-NAME and ODQ) validated the effects of alcohol on uterine NO system. Alcohol decreased the levels of amajor endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) excitatory site Pser1177eNOS (p<0.05) compared to the normal and pair-fed Ctrls, whereas alcohol significantly increased the levels of a major eNOS inhibitory site Pthr495eNOS (p<0.001). Total eNOS was significantly decreased in the alcohol group compared to the normal and pair-fed Ctrls (p<0.001). These data show that chronic binge alcohol impairs uterine vascular adaptations during pregnancy. Alcohol specifically impairs endothelium-dependent NO-mediated vasodilation via its effects on specific excitatory and inhibitory eNOS multi-site phosphorylation sites. These data underscore the importance ofmaternal uterine vascular adaptations in the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a multitude of neurological problems in offspring, varying from subtle behavioral changes to severe mental retardation. These alterations are collectively referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Early alcohol exposure can strongly affect the visual system and children with FASD can exhibit an amblyopia-like pattern of vision acuity defects even in the absence of optical and oculomotor disruptions. Here we test whether early alcohol exposure can lead to a disruption in visual acuity, using a mousemodel of FASD to mimic alcohol consumption in the last months of human gestation. To accomplish this, mice were exposed to ethanol (5 g/kg i.p.) or saline on postnatal days (P) 5, 7 and 9. Two to three weeks later, we recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to assess spatial frequency detection and contrast sensitivity, conducted electroretinography (ERG) to further assess visual function, and imaged retinotopy using optical imaging of intrinsic signals.We observed that animals exposed to ethanol displayed spatial frequency acuity curves similar to controls. However, ethanol treated animals showed a significant deficit in contrast sensitivity. Moreover, ERGs revealed a marked decrease in both a-and b-wave amplitudes, and optical imaging suggested that the elevationmaps of the primary visual cortex in ethanol treated animals have a 20-30degree difference in map tilt compared to saline controls. Overall, our findings suggest that binge alcohol drinking restricted to the lastmonths of gestation can lead to marked deficits in visual function.

N2  - Ethanol causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders partly by inhibiting adhesion mediated by the L1 neural cell adhesion molecule.We showed previously that L1 sensitivity to ethanol requires phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 substrate S1248 on the L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1-CD). Here we show that L1 sensitivity to ethanol also requires phosphorylation of Y1176 in the L1-CD by Src family kinase (SFK). Inhibition of phosphorylation using the SFK inhibitors PP2 or AZD0530 did not inhibit L1 adhesion but abolished ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion. Replacement of L1-Y1176 with leucine, which cannot be phosphorylated, also abolished ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion without altering L1 adhesion in the absence of ethanol.We used antibody 74-5H7, which recognizes only the dephosphorylated state of L1-Y1176 to show that clonal, ethanol-sensitive L1-expressing NIH/3T3 cells have higher levels of Y1176 phosphorylation than ethanol-insensitive cells. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of L1-Y1176, like phosphorylation of L1-S1248, is necessary for ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion, and differences in phosphorylation of Y1176 might also account for differences in sensitivity to ethanol among different cells. To learn whether differential phosphorylation of L1-Y1176 is associated with differential sensitivity to ethanol teratogenesis, wemeasured L1-1176 phosphorylation in embryonic day-10 embryos from C57BL/6 J and C57BL/6 N mice. Prvious studies have shown that prenatal ethanol exposure causes a higher incidence of ocular defects in C57BL/6 J mice than in C57BL/6 N mice, in this study we found that phosphorylation of L1-1176 is higher in C57BL/6 J mice than in C57BL/6 N mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that phosphorylation of multiple sites in the L1-CD is necessary for ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion, and that constitutive differences in phosphorylation of the L1-CD phosphorylation partly determine the susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis. Genes that encode proteins that regulate the phosphorylation of these sites might, therefore, be susceptibility genes for FASD.

N2  - Alcohol drinking inflicts a broad spectrum of consequences, which range fromundetectable effects to severe dysmorphology, growth retardation and neurodevelopmental deficits, which lead to diverse neurological abnormalities and psychosocial disabilities that are independent of dosage and stage of alcohol exposure. Can the genetic background contribute to such diversified phenotypic outcomes? The presence of several differential alcohol vulnerabilities among mouse strains, including C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2), support this hypothesis by holding alcohol factors constant to rule out the innate or interactive gene 9 environment differences. Using embryonic B6 and D2 cultures to eliminate confounding factors produced by the maternal environment, we demonstrated that the fetal genetic background contributes to the observed differences in alcohol (300-400 mg/dl) vulnerability at the organ (e.g. brain, heart and eye) and cellular levels (e.g. apoptosis and neural stem cell differentiation). Further, to identify the genomic signatures of the B6 and D2 strains, we mapped the B6 and D2 genomes onto release 66 (NCBI37/mm9) of the M. musculus genome from Ensembl using CLC GenomicsWorkbench V4.7.We then overlaid our Affymetrix expression data to identify strainspecific, fixed genomic loci that are differentially influenced by alcohol.We identified over 100,000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between the two strains. Using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we found ~1200 differentially expressed genes between B6 and D2. Over 400 contained SNVs between the two lines, indicating potential cis-acting elements at these loci. Using two-factor analysis, we determined that 11/54 genes exhibiting differential responses to alcohol (5%FDR) contain SNVs. These include Eya2 (Eyes absent Homolog 2), Csmd3 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3), Tac2 (Tachykinin 2), Apold1 (Apolipoprotein L Domain Containing 1), Psme4 (Proteasome). These findings warrant further analysis of genetic contribution to alcohol susceptibility. A better understanding of the innate and GXE interactions will contribute significantly to the understanding of the mechanism and diversity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and further the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD.

T1  - Higher functioning children with prenatal alcohol exposure: Is there a specific neurocognitive profile?

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Recent attempts to identify a neurocognitive profile of children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have led to an emerging "generalized deficit" conceptualization marked by diffuse information processing and integration difficulties as opposed to a specific profile. This study examines whether this conceptualization can be extended to higher functioning children with PAE who are without intellectual disability and addresses several limitations of previous research. One hundred twenty-five children aged 6-12 years with social skills deficits, 97 of whom met diagnostic criteria for a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), underwent a comprehensive, multi-informant assessment of neurocognitive, emotional, social, behavioral, and adaptive functioning. Multivariate analyses of variance examined differences in functioning between the PAE group and a nonexposed comparison group with and without controlling for child IQ. Results indicated that the PAE group returned significantly poorer scores than the nonexposed group on every construct assessed, including executive functioning, attention, working/visuospatial memory, linguistic abstraction, adaptive behavior, emotional/behavioral functioning, and social cognition. These differences largely maintained after controlling for IQ and were similar regardless of informant, although teachers reported somewhat fewer group differences. Within the PAE group, no differences were found across FASD subtypes. These results provide evidence extending the emerging generalized deficit conceptualization of children with PAE to those higher functioning individuals without global intellectual disability. © 2013 The Author(s).

N2  - Background There is a growing need for validated tools to screen children at risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The Neurobehavioral Screening Tool (NST) is one of several promising screening measures for FASD, though further evidence is needed to establish the tool's psychometric utility. Objective To assess the predictive accuracy of the NST among children with an FASD diagnosis, with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but no FASD diagnosis, and typically developing controls. Method The NST was completed by caregivers of children ages 6 to 17, including 48 with FASD, 22 with PAE, and 32 typically developing non-exposed controls. Predictive accuracy coefficients were calculated using Nash et al. (2006) criteria, and compared against controls. An alternative scoring scheme was also investigated to determine optimum referral thresholds using item-level total scores. Results The NST yielded 62.5% sensitivity for participants with FASD and 50% for PAE. Specificity values were 100% with no typically developing control scoring positive. Within the FASD group there was a trend for higher sensitivity among adolescents aged 12 to17 (70.8%) compared with children aged 6 to 11 years (54.2%), p = 0.23. Conclusion The findings support a growing body of literature evidencing psychometric promise for the clinical utility of the NST as an FASD screening tool, though further research on possible age-effects is warranted. The availability of a validated clinical screening tool for FASD, such as the NST, would aid in accurately screening a large number of children and lead to a timelier diagnostic referral. © 2014 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), characterized by significant changes in the physiology, structural plasticity of hippocampal function, including long-term deficits in learning and memory. Environmental enrichment has long been known to improve motor and cognitive function levels, causes several neurochemical and morphological alterations in the brain. Therefore, the effects of environmental enrichment on the neurobehavioral and neurotrophic changes in mice exposed prenatally to alcohol were investigated in this study. The pregnant dams were given 25 % ethanol (w/v) or isocaloric sucrose by liquid diet from gestation day 7 to 20. After weaning on postnatal day 28, offspring were exposed to standard cage (CC, CFAS) or enriched living conditions (CE, EFAS) for 8 weeks. Neurobehavioral studies both on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and place and cue learning strategy, a striatum-dependent test, were measured by the Morris water maze task. Moreover, the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was also used in order to study the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level in both the hippocampus and striatum of mice. Neurobehavioral studies show that animals exposed prenatally to alcohol were impaired as shown in both hippocampal-dependent spatial/ place and striatal-dependent response/cue learning tests. Moreover, the levels of BDNF expression both in the hippocampus and striatum of mice were also decreased. Interestingly, environmental enrichment can ameliorate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure both on the neurobehavioral and neurotrophic levels. These observations indicated that enriched environment attenuated memory impairment of prenatal alcohol exposure both in hippocampal and striatal circuitry.

N2  - The maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy causes birth defects and lifelong disabilities in the affected children. Due to the wide range of symptoms related to prenatal alcohol exposition, the umbrella term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is used. FASD covers full Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (pFAS). Children with FAS are smaller in length and weight than healthy children of their age. Head circumference is smaller as well. Typical signs of FAS are facial characteristics such small eyes, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip. Many affected children only show distinct behavioural problems (pFAS). Children with FAS or pFAS do not recognize dangerous situations, they would go with anyone, and are easily influenced. They are forgetful, do not learn from consequences. The diagnosis of FAS goes by small size and weight of the children, and the typical facial alterations. pFAS, however, is diagnosed if behavioural, social and emotional problems are present, and prenatal alcohol exposition is assured by anamnesis. Medical treatment is supplemented by occupational and behavioural therapy. The affected children need instruction, orientation, apportionment concerning time (and space), and a firm daily routine. At legal age, most patients with FASD are not able to live autonomously. They are naive and easily talked into things, therefore they require long-lasting care. Prevention and patient education, rather than being scaring, are supposed to invite and motivate pregnant women and their relatives to act responsible-minded.

N2  - Background. Suboptimal nutrition may explain the higher incidence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in disadvantaged populations. A clinical trial evaluated potential benefits of micronutrient supplementation, including choline, in an at risk populationin Khmelnitsky and Rivne, Omni-Net sites inWestern Ukraine. Methods. Alcohol-using and nondrinking women recruited mid-pregnancy were randomized to: 1) multivitamin/multimineral supplement (MVM); 2) MVM+ choline; 2) non-supplements. At 6-Months, children (N= 192) were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd ED) yielding standard scores for Mental Development Index (MDI), Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), orientation, emotional reactivity, and motor performance. Results. Generalized Linear Modeling evaluated the impact of amount of alcohol used preconceptionally and within pregnancy. We collapsed the two supplement groups (Suppl group) and controlled social class (SES), smoking, gender, vitamin and folic acid use prior to recruitment. MDI was significantly impacted by alcohol dose during pregnancy (beta = -14.66, X2 (1) =9.3, p < .002) with those exposed to more alcohol having lower cognitive scores. Those who received supplements performed better (beta = -3.69, X2(1) =8.03, p < .005). PDI scores did not differ by nutrition but showed a significant effect of alcohol dose during pregnancy (beta = -26.99, X2 (1) =8.28, p < .004). Orientation behavior also differed as a function of Suppl Group (beta = -5.45, X2 (1) =4.51, p < .03) and as a result of alcohol dose at conception (beta = -4.52,X 2 (1) =5.75, p < .02); Motor Optimality was affected by alcohol dose at conception and during pregnancy. Conclusions. Results suggest that multimicronutrient supplementation reduces negative impact of alcohol use during pregnancy on specific outcomes.

N2  - Background. The cardinal features of full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have been well-described. However, prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broader spectrum of structural defects with implications regarding the mechanisms of alcohol's effects on the developing fetus. Methods. We examined 831 children from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) using a structured protocol for diagnosis of FASD. Each child was evaluated for the cardinal facial and growth features, as well as for additional structural defects thought to occur more often in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects were classified as FAS, Deferred or No FAS. Groups were compared on prevalence of additional features observed, and were stratified by diagnostic category for sex, race and age. Results. Of the eight additional features evaluated, there was a statistically significant increase in seven. Children in the FAS group had the highest prevalence of additional features and those in the No FAS group had the lowest. Four of the additional features, including decreased elbow pronation/supination, decreased finger extension, hockey stick palmar crease, and other palmar crease abnormalities, could be related to decreased fetal movement, the result of the effect of alcohol on early brain development. The frequency of additional structural features varied by age and race of the child. Conclusions. This study shows that prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broad spectrum of structural defects, which is critical in documenting the true prevalence of this disorder.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt development, leading to life-long cognitive deficits. We have reported that the essential nutrient choline can protect against alcohol-induced behavioral deficits, even when administered after developmental alcohol exposure. Specifically, postnatal choline administration improves performance on memory tasks that depend on the functional integrity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Choline likely improves cognitive performance by acting as a methyl donor, a precursor to cell membranes, and/or as a precursor to acetylcholine. Using a rat model, we examined the effects of developmental alcohol exposure and postnatal choline supplementation on cholinergic receptors. Sprague-Dawley rats received ethanol (5.25 g/kg/ day) or sham intubations from postnatal days (PD) 4-9, and were treated with choline (100 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or saline from PD 10-30. On PD 38, quantitative autoradiography was used to measure nicotinic cholinergic receptor densities. Alcohol significantly reduced alpha7 receptor densities in the PFC, the amygdala, and hippocampus. Choline attenuated some of these effects, although receptor densities were still lower than those of controls. In contrast, alcohol significantly increased non-alpha7 receptor densities in various forebrain structures, and choline selectively reduced receptor densities to control levels, but only in the PFC. Choline had no significant effect on nicotinic receptor densities among the controls. Alcohol-induced alterations in cholinergic functioning likely contribute to the cognitive impairments caused by developmental alcohol exposure. These results suggest that choline supplementation may serve as an effective treatment for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, in part, by altering ethanol's action on cholinergic development and functioning.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can induce important anomalies in the developing brain, being embryogenesis an important critical period for the craniofacial defects and mental disabilities associated with foetal alcohol syndrome. We generate neural progenitors (NPs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to reproduce early stages of human brain development and we evaluate the effects of ethanol during early embryogenesis. We show that neuroepithelial progenitors display the morphological and functional characteristics of their embryonic counterparts, and the proper timing of neurons and glia cells generation, reproducing the early stages of human brain development. Immunocytochemical and RT-PCR analyses reveal that cells appeared as clusters during neuroepithelial cell proliferation, and that the genes associated with the neuroectodermal (Pax-6) and the endodermic (alpha-fetoprotein, AFP) lineages decreased in parallel to the up-regulation of the genes of neural progenitors (nestin, Tuj1), followed by their differentiation into neurons (MAP-2 + , GABA+), oligodendrocytes (GalC+) and astrocytes (GFAP+). Ethanol exposure (25 mM) impairs the derivation of hESCs towards NPs, altering the disappearance of the neuroectodermal and endodermic markers PAX-6 and AFP, as well as the Nanog and Sox2 expression, suggesting that ethanol alters cell fate and maintains the NPs in undifferented state. Ethanol also impairs the differentiation of NPs into mature neurons and astrocytes (e.g. MAP-2, GFAP, GABA). These results provide evidence that exposure to alcohol during early embryogenesis, alters cell fate and disrupts the transformation of NPs into mature neural cells. These effects could contribute to the mechanisms that lead to the abnormal craniofacial defects associated with FASD.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to impairment in cerebellar structure and function, including eyeblink conditioning. The deep cerebellar nuclei, which play a critical role in cerebellar-mediated learning, receive extensive inputs from brain stem and cerebellar cortex and provide the point of origin for most of the output fibers to other regions of the brain. We used in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurochemistry in this important cerebellar region. Methods: MRS data from the deep cerebellar nuclei were acquired from 37 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 17 non- or minimally exposed controls from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa. Results: Increased maternal alcohol consumption around time of conception was associated with lower N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the deep nuclei (r = -0.33, p < 0.05). Higher levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to lower levels of the choline-containing metabolites (r = -0.37, p < 0.01), glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine (Cho). Alcohol consumption levels both at conception (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and during pregnancy (r = 0.38, p < 0.01) were related to higher levels of glutamate plus glutamine (Glx). All these effects continued to be significant after controlling for potential confounders. Conclusions: The lower NAA levels seen in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure may reflect impaired neuronal integrity in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Our finding of lower Cho points to disrupted Cho metabolism of membrane phospholipids, reflecting altered neuropil development with potentially reduced content of dendrites and synapses. The alcohol-related alterations in Glx may suggest a disruption of the glutamate-glutamine cycling involved in glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Invited commentary on Australian fetal alcohol spectrum disorder diagnostic guidelines
A1  - Astley S.J.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The publication of Australian fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) diagnostic guidelines marks an important step forward in Australia's efforts to prevent FASD. But do we need yet another set of FASD guidelines? At the 5th International FASD Conference, the ever growing number of FASD diagnostic guidelines was identified as a core area of concern by leaders in FASD worldwide. All agreed we need to strive to adopt a single set of guidelines. It is essential that FASD diagnosis advance to incorporate new knowledge and technology. But to date, the field of FASD has seen multiple sets of guidelines published that do not address the important question-How is the performance of these new guidelines superior to the performance of existing guidelines to warrant/justify their introduction into the medical literature?The Australian guidelines include FAS, PFAS and Neurodevelopmental Disorder-Alcohol Exposed (ND-AE). This latter group includes individuals with severe CNS abnormalities without the physical features of FAS. This is the group the 4-Digit-Code calls Static-Encephalopathy-Alcohol-Exposed (SE-AE). The criteria for FAS, PFAS, and ND-AE (or what the 4-Digit-Code calls SE-AE) are identical between the Australian and 4-Digit-Code guidelines with the exception of one very small, but very consequential difference in facial criteria for PFAS. The 4-Digit-Code requires a Rank 3 FAS facial phenotype for PFAS (J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol 20(3):e416-e467, 2013); the Australian guidelines relax the criteria to include the Rank 2 FAS facial phenotype. This relaxation of the criteria renders the facial phenotype NOT specific to prenatal alcohol exposure as confirmed in published empirical studies. If the facial phenotype is not specific to (caused only by) prenatal alcohol exposure one can no longer validly call the outcome PFAS. When one makes a diagnosis of FAS (full or partial), one is stating explicitly that the individual has a syndrome caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. One is also stating explicitly that the biological mother drank alcohol during pregnancy and, as a result, harmed her child. These are bold conclusions to draw and are not without medical, ethical, and even legal consequences. So the question remains-Why go against the published empirical evidence and relax the PFAS facial criteria into the normal range? © 2014 Astley; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) consists of a pattern of mental and physical defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. The disorder is well described during childhood while little is known about adults. This ongoing study investigates Swedish adults with FAS regarding their socieconomic situation by variables such as state of employment, early retirement from work, dependence on public welfare, criminality, marital and parental state, mortality rate, and medical care. Adults with FAS (N=80, age 19 to 49 years, mean age 30 years, 63% men) and a comparison group matched to gender and age (N=2664) are included. Data are obtained from the Swedish Governmental Office of Statistics, National Board of Health and Welfare, Enforcement Authorities, and the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. Up to now data show that 54% of the adults with FAS and 26% of the comparison group (p<0.05) were unemployed. Thirty-three percent of the study group versus 3% of the comparison group (p<0.001) had retired early from work. Twenty-six percent of the individuals with FAS and six percent of the comparison group (p<0.001) were dependent on public welfare. Eighty percent of the study group and 50% of the comparison group (p<0.01) were living as singles (i.e., without their children), if any, and/or a partner. The results indicate that the adults with FAS had a difficult socioeconomic situation compared with their gender and age-matched persons. Such knowledge might be useful in understanding and providing support to this vulnerable and socially-exposed population.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are thought to be a leading cause of developmental disabilities worldwide. However, data are lacking on alcohol use among pregnant women in many countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of alcohol consumption by pregnant women in Ukraine. Methods: Cross-sectional screening of pregnant women was conducted in 2 regions of Ukraine during the recruitment phase of an ongoing clinical study that is part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. Women attending a routine prenatal visit at 1 of 2 participating regional centers were asked about alcohol consumption. Quantity and frequency of alcoholic beverages consumed in the month around conception and in the most recent month of pregnancy were measured using a standard interview instrument. Results: Between 2007 and 2012, 11,909 pregnant women were screened on average in the second trimester of pregnancy. Of these, 92.7% reported being ever-drinkers. Among ever-drinkers, 54.8% reported drinking alcohol in the month around conception and 12.9% consumed at least 3 drinks on at least 1 day in that time period. In the most recent month of pregnancy, 46.3% continued to report alcohol use and 9.2% consumed at least 3 drinks per day. Significant predictors of average number of drinks or heavier drinking per day in either time period in pregnancy included lower gravidity, being single, unmarried/living with a partner, or separated, lower maternal education, smoking, younger age at initiation of drinking, and higher score on the TWEAK screening test for harmful drinking. Conclusions: These findings support the need for education/intervention in women of childbearing age in Ukraine and can help inform targeted interventions for women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The initiation of a standard screening protocol in pregnancy is a step in the right direction. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Adipose tissue secretes numerous bioactive peptides ("adipocytokines"). Visceral fat mediates inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, subcutaneous fat is the principal source of adiponectin production. Adiponectin, consisting of 247 amino acids and single nucleotide polymorphisms (mutations), causes hypoadiponectinemia. Individuals with this mutation are highly susceptible for development of insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, hypertention, and left ventricular hypertrophy. We hypothesize that alcohol consumption during pregnancy may alter endocrine signaling, by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines thus inducing fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Even low-dose/or short duration ethanol exposure early in development can produce more subtle effects by alteration of subcutaneous fat and subsequently, decrease in adiponectin production. Zebrafish eggs (AB strain) were raised in water (control) or in 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, and 2.5% ethanol solution for one of 3dpf, 5 dpf, 10 dpf, 15dpf, or 20dpf. Anatomical measures including heart diameter and total body length were compared across groups. At the concentration of 2.5%, there were more abnormal physical distortions and significantly higher mortality rates than any other group. Nile Red (NR) and Oil Red O (ORO) staining was used to detect adipogenesis (visceral vs subcutaneous) fat depots. Adipogenesis during zebrafish development was altered and subcutaneous fat was depleted at 15pft after 2% alcohol exposure compared with control. The expression of an "adipogenic" transcriptional program including PPAR, SREBP1c, CEBPalpha and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, HIF-1alpha ROS, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB was altered, as evident from quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We conclude that exposure of zebrafish larvae to ethanol during development results in modified external and internal morphological development and that the severity of these effects is due to remarkable changes in adiposity and hypoadiponectinemia.

These co-occurring public health problems raise the need to understand alcohol consumption among trauma-exposed pregnant women in this setting. Since a known predictor of drinking during pregnancy is drinking behavior before pregnancy, this study explored the relationship between women's drinking levels before and after pregnancy recognition, and whether traumatic experiences - childhood abuse or recent intimate partner violence (IPV) - moderated this relationship.Methods:Women with incident pregnancies (N = 66) were identified from a longitudinal cohort of 560 female drinkers in a township of Cape Town, South Africa. Participants were included if they reported no pregnancy at one assessment and then reported pregnancy four months later at the next assessment. Alcohol use was measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and traumatic experiences of childhood abuse and recent IPV were also assessed. Hierarchical linear regressions controlling for race and age examined childhood abuse and recent IPV as moderators of the effect of pre-pregnancy recognition drinking on post-pregnancy recognition AUDIT scores.Results:Following pregnancy recognition, 73% of women reported drinking at hazardous levels (AUDIT > 8). Sixty-four percent reported early and/or recent exposure to trauma. While drinking levels before pregnancy significantly predicted drinking levels after pregnancy recognition, t(64) = 3.50, p <.01, this relationship was moderated by experiences of childhood abuse, B =577, t(60) = -2.58, p =.01, and recent IPV, B =477, t(60) = -2.16, p =.04. Pregnant women without traumatic experiences reported drinking at levels consistent with levels before pregnancy recognition. However, women with traumatic experiences tended to report elevated AUDIT scores following pregnancy recognition, even if low-risk drinkers previously.Conclusion:This study explored how female drinkers in South Africa may differentially modulate their drinking patterns upon pregnancy recognition, depending on trauma history. Our results suggest that women with traumatic experiences are more likely to exhibit risky alcohol consumption when they become pregnant, regardless of prior risk. These findings illuminate the relevance of trauma-informed efforts to reduce FASD in South Africa. © 2014 Choi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is an umbrella term that refers to a wide range of behavioral and cognitive deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. It involves changes in brain gene expression that underlie lifelong FASD symptoms. How these changes are achieved from immediate to long-term effects, and how they are maintained, is unknown. We have used the C57BL/6J mouse to assess the dynamics of genomic alterations following binge alcohol exposure. Ethanol-exposed fetal (short-term effect) and adult (long-term effect) brains were assessed for gene expression and microRNA (miRNA) changes using Affymetrix mouse arrays. We identified 48 and 68 differentially expressed genes in short- and long-term groups, respectively. No gene was common between the 2 groups. Short-term (immediate) genes were involved in cellular compromise and apoptosis, which represent ethanol's toxic effects. Long-term genes were involved in various cellular functions, including epigenetics. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed the downregulation of long-term genes: Camk1g, Ccdc6, Egr3, Hspa5, and Xbp1. miRNA arrays identified 20 differentially expressed miRNAs, one of which (miR-302c) was confirmed. miR-302c was involved in an inverse relationship with Ccdc6. A network-based model involving altered genes illustrates the importance of cellular redox, stress and inflammation in FASD. Our results also support a critical role of apoptosis in FASD, and the potential involvement of miRNAs in the adaptation of gene expression following prenatal ethanol exposure. The ultimate molecular footprint involves inflammatory disease, neurological disease and skeletal and muscular disorders as major alterations in FASD. At the cellular level, these processes represent abnormalities in redox, stress and inflammation, with potential underpinnings to anxiety. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study is in collaboration with MaternalInfant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC), a look into the Canadian profile of in utero exposures through meconium analysis. The focus of this study was to investigate the incidence of heavy alcohol use during pregnancy in Canada through meconium analysis. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) serve as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. This study is the first to investigate alcohol use during pregnancy in Canada through meconium FAEE analysis. METHODS: Meconium was collected from 1,537 newborns at 11 obstetric units across Canada and participating mothers also completed questionnaires that contained a section focusing on alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. The questionnaires will serve as a maternal self-report and will be compared to meconium FAEE concentration. Any meconium sample with a total FAEE concentration (the sum of ethyl palmitate, oleate, stearate and linoleate concentrations) greater than 2 nmol/g meconium is classified as positive for excessive alcohol consumption during the second and/or third trimesters of pregnancy. RESULTS: Thus far, 82 samples have been processed, with 62 eligible for analysis. Of the samples analyzed, 10 were deemed transitional and results inconclusive and 2 were identified as positive. This equates to a 3.22% positivity rate for heavy fetal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSION: Through this study, heavy alcohol use rates in a pregnant population in Canada will be determined. Meconium FAEE analysis via GC-MS is currently ongoing at the Motherisk Laboratory.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is a leading cause of significant neurobehavioral and neurocognitive deficits. Its potential consequences for eating behaviors, nutritional status, and other nutritional issues in childhood have received little attention. Methods: Nineteen children (11 boys, 8 girls) of mean age 9.6 years, referred for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) screening and assessment, were analyzed with physical exams and caregiver questionnaires to identify possible abnormalities in food and eating behaviors. Fourteen children contributed 24-hour diet recalls and were assessed for nutritional status. Results: Seventy-nine percent of participants were diagnosed with FASD and 63.2% had confirmed PAE. Fifty percent of girls were overweight or obese, whereas 37% of boys had reduced stature, weight, or body mass index for their age. Recurring feeding problems included constant snacking (36.8%), lack of satiety (26.3%), and picky eating/poor appetite (31.6%). None had oral feeding problems. Constipation was common (26.3%). Macronutrient intakes were largely normal, but sugar consumption was excessive (140 to 190% of recommendations) in 57% of subjects. Vitamin A intake exceeded the upper limit for 64% of participants, whereas >50% had intakes <80% of recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for choline, vitamin E, potassium, beta-carotene, and essential fatty acids; 100% had vitamin D intakes <80% of the RDA. Conclusions: PAE may be associated with altered acquisition and distribution of body mass with increasing age. Disordered eating was common. The increased feeding behaviors surrounding lack of satiety suggest that self-regulation may be altered. Constipation could reflect low dietary fiber or altered gastrointestinal function. These exploratory data suggest that children with PAE may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies, which are influenced by inappropriate food preferences, disordered eating patterns, medication use, and the stressful dynamics surrounding food preparation and mealtime. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Adolescent binge alcohol exposure has long-lasting effects on the expression of hypothalamic genes that regulate the stress response, even in the absence of subsequent adult alcohol exposure. This suggests that alcohol can induce permanent gene expression changes, potentially through epigenetic modifications to specific genes. Epigenetic modifications can be transmitted to future generations therefore, and in these studies we investigated the effects of adolescent binge alcohol exposure on hypothalamic gene expression patterns in the F1 generation offspring. It has been well documented that maternal alcohol exposure during fetal development can have devastating neurological consequences. However, less is known about the consequences of maternal and/or paternal alcohol exposure outside of the gestational time frame. Here, we exposed adolescent male and female rats to a repeated binge EtOH exposure paradigm and then mated them in adulthood. Hypothalamic samples were taken from the offspring of these animals at postnatal day (PND) 7 and subjected to a genome-wide microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR for selected genes. Importantly, the parents were not intoxicated at the time of mating and were not exposed to EtOH at any time during gestation therefore the offspring were never directly exposed to EtOH. Our results showed that the offspring of alcohol-exposed parents had significant differences compared to offspring from alcohol-naive parents. Specifically, major differences were observed in the expression of genes that mediate neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity during neurodevelopment, genes important for directing chromatin remodeling, posttranslational modifications or transcription regulation, as well as genes involved in regulation of obesity and reproductive function. These data demonstrate that repeated binge alcohol exposure during pubertal development can potentially have detrimental effects on future offspring even in the absence of direct fetal alcohol exposure. © 2014 Przybycien-Szymanska et al.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Detection of at-risk alcohol consumption during pregnancy is essential for prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs), with the widely used T-ACE screen developed for that purpose. Recent work with an urban cohort revealed that increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point from 2 to 3 doubled specificity of detecting risk drinking in pregnancy without reducing sensitivity substantially. The goal of this study was to further validate a cut-point of 3 (TACER-3) in a rural cohort. METHODS: Prospectively recruited pregnant patients (n=540) completed the T-ACE and a simple alcohol questionnaire that assessed the women's self-reported typical pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption. RESULTS: 22.2% of participants were positive on the T-ACE (cutpoint =2) compared to 5.4% positive on the TACER-3 (cut-point =3). An ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD contrasts revealed that "At- Risk" women (positive on T-ACE and TACER-3) reported consuming significantly more alcohol per day before pregnancy than both the "Notat- Risk" (negative on both on T-ACE and TACER-3) and "Change Risk" (positive on T-ACE but not TACER-3) women (omnibus F=22.3, p<.001). The rate of average daily alcohol use among women in the "Change Risk" group was not significantly different than women in the "No Risk" group. Relative Risk scores indicated that women in the TACER-3-positive "At- Risk" group were 6.6 times more likely to drink alcohol at risk levels (>0.5 absolute oz./day) than women in the "No-Risk" group, and 2.6 times more likely than women in the "Change Risk" group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the original T-ACE, the TACER-3 was more effective at selectively identifying women who were drinking at risk level prior to pregnancy recognition in this rural cohort. These analyses further validate prior findings that using the TACER-3 reduces "false positives." The TACER-3 allows for more efficient use of health care provider time in directing targeted clinical interventions with those pregnant women most at risk for adverse fetal outcomes.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, a continuum of physiological, behavioural, and cognitive phenotypes that include increased risk for anxiety and learning-associated disorders. Prenatal alcohol exposure results in life-long disorders that may manifest in part through the induction of long-term gene expression changes, potentially maintained through epigenetic mechanisms. Findings: Here we report a decrease in the expression of Canabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1) and an increase in the expression of the regulatory microRNA miR-26b in the brains of adult mice exposed to ethanol during neurodevelopment. Furthermore, we show that miR-26b has significant complementarity to the 3'-UTR of the Cnr1 transcript, giving it the potential to bind and reduce the level of Cnr1 expression. Conclusions: These findings elucidate a mechanism through which some genes show long-term altered expression following prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to persistent alterations to cognitive function and behavioural phenotypes observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2013 Stringer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in the world. However, little is known about what men and women who attend alcohol serving establishments believe about alcohol use during pregnancy and how these beliefs may be related to alcohol use. Objectives: To understand FASD beliefs and related behaviors among men and women attending alcohol-serving establishments. Methods: We surveyed 1047 men (n=565) and women (n=482) -including pregnant women and men with pregnant partners- attending alcohol serving establishments in a township located in Cape Town, South Africa. Results: Among both pregnant (n=53) and non-pregnant (n=429) women, 54% reported drinking alcohol at least 2-4 times per month, and 57% reported having at least 3-4 alcohol drinks during a typical drinking session. Pregnant women were less likely to believe that they should not drink alcohol and that alcohol can harm a fetus when compared to non-pregnant women. Similar findings were observed between men with pregnant partners compared to men without pregnant partners. Among women, beliefs about how much alcohol pregnant women can safely drink were associated with self-reported alcohol use. Conclusions: Efforts to address FASD need to focus on understanding how men and women perceive alcohol use during pregnancy and situational factors that contribute to alcohol consumption among pregnant women attending alcohol serving establishments. Structural and individual-level interventions targeting women at alcohol serving establishments should be prioritized to mitigate alcohol use during pregnancy. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Aims: Although Russia has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable burden of disease, little is known about the existing research on prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) in this country. The objective of this study was to locate and review published and unpublished studies related to any aspect of PAE and FASD conducted in or using study populations from Russia. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple English and Russian electronic bibliographic databases. In addition, a manual search was conducted in several major libraries in Moscow. Results: The search revealed a small pool of existing research studies related to PAE and/or FASD in Russia (126: 22 in English and 104 in Russian). Existing epidemiological data indicate a high prevalence of PAE and FASD, which underlines the strong negative impact that alcohol has on mortality, morbidity and disability in Russia. High levels of alcohol consumption by women of childbearing age, low levels of contraception use, and low levels of knowledge by health and other professionals regarding the harmful effects of PAE put this country at great risk of further alcohol-affected pregnancies. Conclusions: Alcohol preventive measures in Russia warrant immediate attention. More research focused on alcohol prevention and policy is needed in order to reduce alcohol-related harm, especially in the field of FASD. © The Author 2013.

N2  - Alcohol consumption by mothers during pregnancy causes a fetal alcohol syndrome associated with massive neuronal apoptosis. We have recently shown that taurine at a dose of 2 g/kg saves about 50% of dying cerebellar neurons from ethanol-induced apoptosis in 7-day-old mice. However, a further increase in the taurine dose to ethanol-treated mice had a toxic and in some cases lethal effect. In the present work we studied the toxic effects of taurine and ethanol coadministration in three age groups: 7-day-old, adult (5 to 6 months old), and old (12 to 13 months old) mice. Taurine and ethanol were injected in two half-doses: taurine at 0 and 4 h and ethanol at 1 and 3 h. The minimal 100% lethal doses in coadministration of taurine and ethanol were the following: 7-day-old mice-6 g/kg taurine + 5 g/kg ethanol, adult mice-10 g/kg of taurine + 8 g/kg of ethanol, and old mice-above 6 g/kg of taurine + 6 g/kg of ethanol. All mice treated with taurine or ethanol alone survived. The adult and old mice dying from the combined toxicity of taurine and ethanol showed a marked fall in blood glucose, which may be one reason for lethality. A comparison of the lethal doses of taurine and ethanol coadministration in different age groups allows us to conclude that the adverse effect of the combined toxicity of taurine and ethanol is age dependent. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

N2  - Background: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that emotional withdrawal is an early indicator of affective disorder in infants heavily exposed prenatally to alcohol, which is independent of alcohol-related effects on mother-infant interaction and temperament and discriminated between children later diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS) and predicted cognitive and affective outcomes at 5 and 9 years. Methods: The sample consisted of Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) infants, whose mothers were interviewed during pregnancy regarding their alcohol consumption using a timeline follow-back approach. Infant emotional withdrawal (n = 85) was assessed on the Alarm Distress Baby Scale at 6.5 months. Mother-infant interaction was evaluated from video recordings during free play and infant feeding at 6.5 months (n = 127). Infant temperament was assessed by maternal report on the EAS Temperament Survey at 13 months (n = 119). Sociodemographic and psychological correlates of maternal alcohol use and infant iron deficiency were examined as potential confounders. The children were diagnosed for FAS/PFAS by expert dysmorphologists at 5 years, cognitive and affective function at 5 and 9 years. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with increased infant emotional withdrawal and decreased activity, but unrelated to mother-infant interaction or any other temperament measures. Children later diagnosed with FAS and PFAS at 5 years exhibited more emotional withdrawal and less responsivity and activity as infants. Infant withdrawal, responsivity, quality of interaction, and maternal sensitivity also predicted poorer IQ and affective response at 5 and 9 years. When all 4 infant affective measures were examined simultaneously in a regression analysis, only infant emotional withdrawal persisted as a significant predictor of 9-year IQ. Conclusions: This study is the first to document a direct effect of fetal alcohol exposure on emotional withdrawal in infancy. These data link prenatal alcohol to a specific aspect of infant affective function not attributable to mother-infant interaction, infant temperament, or other socioemotional aspects of the infant's environment and identify infant emotional withdrawal as an early indicator of affective disturbance, particularly in children later diagnosed with FAS and PFAS. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Ethanol is known as a potent teratogen responsible for the fetal alcohol syndrome characterized by cognitive deficits especially pronounced in juveniles but ameliorating in adults. Since the mechanisms of these deficits and following partial recovery are not fully elucidated, the aim of the present study was to investigate the process of synaptogenesis in the hippocampus over the first two months of life in control and fetal-alcohol rats. Ethanol was delivered to the pregnant dams by intragastric intubation throughout 7-21 gestation days at the daily dose of 6. g/kg generating a mean blood alcohol level of 246.6 +/- 40.9 mg/dl on gestation day 20. The spine densities as well as the expression of pre- and postsynaptic proteins, synaptophysin (SYP) and PSD-95 protein, were evaluated for three distinct hippocampal regions: CA1, CA2+3, and DG and four postnatal days: PD1, PD10, PD30 and PD60, independently. Our results confirmed an intensive synaptogenesis within the brain spurt period (first 10 postnatal days), however, the temporal pattern of changes in the SYP and PSD-95 expression was different. The ethanol exposure during half of the 1st and the whole 2nd human trimester equivalent resulted in an overall trend toward lower values of synaptic indices at PD1 with a fast recovery from these deficits observed already at PD10. At PD30, around the age when the most pronounced behavioral deficits have been previously reported in juvenile fetal-alcohol subjects, no significant changes were found in either the hippocampal levels of synaptic proteins or in the spine density in principal hippocampal neurons. © 2013 ISDN.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Background: Previous studies on male rodents found that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) decreases the number of serotonin immunoreactive (5-HT-ir) neurons in the brainstem. However, data on the effects of PAE in females are lacking. In light of known sex differences in responsiveness of the 5-HT system and known effects of estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) in the brain, we hypothesized that sex steroids will modulate the adverse effects of PAE on 5-HT neurons in adult females. Methods: Adult females from 3 prenatal groups (Prenatal alcohol-exposed [PAE], Pair-fed [PF], and ad libitum-fed Controls [C]) were ovariectomized (OVX), with or without hormone replacement, or underwent Sham OVX. 5-HT-ir cells were examined in key brainstem areas. Results: Our data support the hypothesis that PAE has long-term effects on the 5-HT system of females and that ovarian steroids have a modulatory role in these effects. Intact (Sham OVX) PAE females had marginally lower numbers of 5-HT-ir neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the brainstem compared with PF and C females. This marginal difference became significant following removal of hormones by OVX. Replacement with E2 restored the number of 5-HT-ir neurons in PAE females to control levels, while P4 reversed the effects of E2. Importantly, despite these differential responses of the 5-HT system to ovarian steroids, there were no differences in E2 and P4 levels among prenatal treatment groups. Conclusions: These data demonstrate long-term, adverse effects of PAE on the 5-HT system of females, as well as differential sensitivity of PAE compared with control females to the modulatory effects of ovarian steroids on 5-HT neurons. Our findings have important implications for understanding sex differences in 5-HT dysfunction in depression/anxiety disorders and the higher rates of these mental health problems in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Introduction: It is well established that individuals exposed to alcohol in utero have reduced cortical grey matter volumes. However, the candidate determinants of these reductions, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), have not been investigated exclusively in alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), the most prevalent fetal alcohol spectrum disorder subgroup that lacks the characteristic facial dysmorphology. Methods: T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 88 participants (8-16 years), 36 diagnosed with ARND and 52 typically developing controls. Scans were submitted to the CIVET pipeline (version 1.1.10). Deformable models were used to construct the inner white matter surfaces and pial surfaces from which CT and SA measures were derived. Group differences in cortical volume, CT, and SA were computed using a general linear model covaried for age, sex, and handedness. Results: Global cortical volume reductions in ARND did not reflect CT, which did not differ between groups. Instead, volume decreases were consistent with global SA reductions in bilateral frontal and temporal as well as right occipital regions. Local reductions in SA were observed in the right superior temporal gyrus and the right occipital-temporal region. Conclusion: Results suggest that in ARND, prenatal alcohol exposure perturbs global SA to a greater degree than CT, particularly in the right temporal lobe. © 2013 The Authors.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) frequently exhibit impairment on tasks measuring inhibition. The objective of this study was to determine if a performance-based relationship exists between psychometric tests and eye movement tasks in children with FASD. Participants for this dataset were aged 5-17 years and included those diagnosed with an FASD (n= 72), those with PAE but no clinical FASD diagnosis (n= 21), and typically developing controls (n= 139). Participants completed a neurobehavioral test battery, which included the NEPSY-II subtests of auditory attention, response set, and inhibition. Each participant completed a series of saccadic eye movement tasks, which included the antisaccade and memory-guided tasks. Both the FASD and the PAE groups performed worse than controls on the subtest measures of attention and inhibition. Compared with controls, the FASD group made more errors on the antisaccade and memory-guided tasks. Among the combined FASD/PAE group, inhibition and switching errors were negatively correlated with direction errors on the antisaccade task but not on the memory-guided task. There were no significant correlations in the control group. These data suggests that response inhibition deficits in children with FASD/PAE are associated with difficulty controlling saccadic eye movements which may point to overlapping brain regions damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. The results of this study demonstrate that eye movement control tasks directly relate to outcome measures obtained with psychometric tests that are used during FASD diagnosis, and may therefore help with early identification of children who would benefit from a multidisciplinary diagnostic assessment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Concise, accurate measures of maternal prenatal alcohol use are needed to better understand fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Measures of drinking by mothers of children with specific FASD diagnoses and mothers of randomly-selected controls are compared and also correlated with physical and cognitive/behavioral outcomes. Results: Measures of maternal alcohol use can differentiate maternal drinking associated with FASD from that of controls and some from mothers of alcohol-exposed normals. Six variables that combine quantity and frequency concepts distinguish mothers of FASD children from normal controls. Alcohol use variables, when applied to each trimester and three months prior to pregnancy, provide insight on critical timing of exposure as well. Measures of drinking, especially bingeing, correlate significantly with increased child dysmorphology and negative cognitive/behavioral outcomes in children, especially low non-verbal IQ, poor attention, and behavioral problems. Logistic regression links (p< .001) first trimester drinking (vs. no drinking) with FASD, elevating FASD likelihood 12 times; first and second trimester drinking increases FASD outcomes 61 times; and drinking in all trimesters 65 times. Conversely, a similar regression (p= .008) indicates that drinking only in the first trimester makes the birth of a child with an FASD 5 times less likely than drinking in all trimesters. Conclusions: There is significant variation in alcohol consumption both within and between diagnostic groupings of mothers bearing children diagnosed within the FASD continuum. Drinking measures are empirically identified and correlated with specific child outcomes. Alcohol use, especially heavy use, should be avoided throughout pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - There are no biological treatments for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), lifelong conditions associated with physical anomalies, brain damage, and neurocognitive abnormalities. In preclinical studies, choline partially ameliorates memory and learning deficits from prenatal alcohol exposure. This phase I pilot study evaluated the feasibility, tolerability, and potential adverse effects of choline supplementation in children with FASD. We hypothesized that choline would be well tolerated with minimal adverse events. The study design was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Participants included 20 children aged 2.5 to 4.9 years with prenatal alcohol exposure and FASD diagnoses. Participants were randomly assigned to 500 mg choline or placebo daily for 9 months (10 active, 10 placebo). Primary outcome measures included feasibility, tolerability, adverse effects, and serum choline levels. Seventeen participants completed the study. Compliance was 82% to 87%, as evidenced by parent-completed log sheets and dose counts. Periodic 24-hour dietary recalls showed no evidence of dietary confounding. Adverse events were minimal and were equivalent in the active and placebo arms with the exception of fishy body odor, which occurred only in the active group. There were no serious adverse events to research participants. This phase I pilot study demonstrates that choline supplementation at 500 mg/d for 9 months in children aged 2 to 5 years is feasible and has high tolerability. Further examination of the efficacy of choline supplementation in FASD is currently underway. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Describe the intellectual performance in a sample of children and adolescents that suffered prenatal exposure of alcohol. Methods: This report constitutes a case series study, comprising 10 subjects between 6 and 16 years old, with a history of fetal alcohol exposure. These subjects underwent a medical evaluation to be characterized as a clinical sample, respecting the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously established. The sample's intellectual performance was studied by means of instruments: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 3rd. Edition (WISC-III) and Raven's Progressive Matrices Test. Results: The sample was evaluated as being of low medium performance by the WISC-III. In the Raven Test the sample exhibited medium intellectual performance. Among all of the WISC-III indexes, Resistance to Distractions was most impaired. The Arithmetic and Picture Arrangement subtests showed more impairment results in comparison of the others subtests. As a secondary consequence, the impairment of these functions can cause difficulties in learning and social interaction and impact the development of these young people. Conclusions: The results of these series of ten cases were compared to those reported in national and international studies. The cognitive impairment caused by alcohol use during pregnancy can manifest in school-age children through learning difficulties and difficulty in establishing social interactions. Thus, prenatal exposure to alcohol becomes a public health issue which needs greater attention from national policies to carry out identification and early intervention.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by excess alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Using an in vitro system, we examined the role that chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure plays in gene expression changes during the early stage of embryonic differentiation. We demonstrated that EtOH affected the cell morphology, cell cycle progression and also delayed the down-regulation of OCT4 and NANOG during differentiation. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis demonstrated that EtOH deregulates many genes and pathways that are involved in early embryogenesis. Follow-up analyzes revealed that EtOH exposure to embryoid bodies (EBs) induced the expression of an organizer-specific gene, goosecoid (GSC), in comparison to controls. Moreover, EtOH treatment altered several important genes that are involved in embryonic structure formation, nervous system development, and placental and embryonic vascularization, which are all common processes that FASD can disrupt. Specifically, EtOH treatment let to a reduction in ALDOC, ENO2 and CDH1 expression, whereas EtOH treatment induced the expression of PTCH1, EGLN1, VEGFA and DEC2 in treated EBs. We also found that folic acid (FA) treatment was able to correct the expression of the majority of genes deregulated by EtOH exposure during early embryo development. Finally, the present study identified a gene set including GSC, which was deregulated by EtOH exposure that may contribute to the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). We also reported that EtOH-induced GSC expression is mediated by Nodal signaling, which may provide a new avenue for analyzing the molecular mechanisms behind EtOH teratogenicity in FASD individuals.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure, especially during early pregnancy, can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome. The pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms of ethanol are related to the effects of ceramide. In this study, we established an alcohol exposure model in wild-type mice and in knockout mice for the key enzyme involved in ceramide metabolism, sphingomyelin synthase 2. This model received daily intragastric administration of 25% ethanol, and pups were used at postnatal days 0, 7, 14, 30 for experiments. Serology and immunofluorescence staining found that ethanol exposure dose-dependently reduced blood sphingomyelin levels in two genotypes of pups, and increased neural cell proliferation and the number of new neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Western blot analysis showed that the relative expression level of protein kinase C alpha increased in two notypes of pups after ethanol exposure. Compared with wild-type pups, the expression level of the important activator protein of the ceramide/ceramide-1-phosphate pathway, protein kinase C alpha, was reduced in the hippocampus of sphingomyelin synthase 2 knockouts. Our findings illustrate that ceramide is involved in alcohol-induced neural proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of pups after prenatal ethanol exposure, and the mechanism may be associated with increased pression of protein kinase C alpha activating the ceramide/ceramide-1-phosphate pathway.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are debilitating, with effects of prenatal alcohol exposure persisting into adolescence and adulthood. Complete characterization of FASD is crucial for the development of diagnostic tools and intervention techniques to decrease the high cost to individual families and society of this disorder. In this experiment, we investigated visual system deficits in adolescents (12-21 years) diagnosed with an FASD by measuring the latency of patients' primary visual M100 responses using MEG. We hypothesized that patients with FASD would demonstrate delayed primary visual responses compared to controls. M100 latencies were assessed both for FASD patients and age-matched healthy controls for stimuli presented at the fovea (central stimulus) and at the periphery (peripheral stimuli; left or right of the central stimulus) in a saccade task requiring participants to direct their attention and gaze to these stimuli. Source modeling was performed on visual responses to the central and peripheral stimuli and the latency of the first prominent peak (M100) in the occipital source timecourse was identified. The peak latency of the M100 responses were delayed in FASD patients for both stimulus types (central and peripheral), but the difference in latency of primary visual responses to central vs. peripheral stimuli was significant only in FASD patients, indicating that, while FASD patients' visual systems are impaired in general, this impairment is more pronounced in the periphery. These results suggest that basic sensory deficits in this population may contribute to sensorimotor integration deficits described previously in this disorder. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause alterations to neurodevelopmental brain. Several studies have described difficulties in many cognitive functions and more specifically in IQ, attention and executive functions. Individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure are at increased risk for ADHD. According to the ADHD ethology, children show different cognitive and behavioral profiles. As reported, children with ADHD related to prenatal alcohol consumption show greater severity and incidence of social adjustment difficulties in comparison to idiopathic ADHD. The present study aims to assess working memory as well as behavioral problems in children with FASD/ADHD in comparison with idiopathic ADHD. METHODS: 17 adopted children diagnosed of FASD/ ADHD, age ranged between 6 and 10 years, were compared with 17 idiopathic ADHD children. Both groups were matched by the same subtype of ADHD, age and sex. Working memory was assessed using Digits, Letter and Number and Arithmetic subtests of the WISC-IV. Behavior problems were assessed using the Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist for Parents and Teachers (CBCL). RESULTS: Statistical analysis using T student shows significant differences between both groups in Digits (p <0.004), Letter and number (p <0.003) and Arithmetic (p < 0.000) WISC-IV subtest. In related to behavioral problems, we found only significant differences in social problems subscale in teacher's CBCL (p < 0,037). CONCLUSION: FASD/ADHD children tend to have more cognitive and behavioral problems compared to probable idiopathic ADHD. This profile is the one described in the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. These differences in neuropsychological profile can contribute to improve the differential diagnosis, the intervention and outcome between both groups. We recommend a routine monitoring FASD/ADHD to implement therapeutic interventions as early as possible.

N2  - Background: While much FASD research has focused on sociological, behavioural, and neuro-structural changes, prenatal alcohol exposure also results in long-term alterations in gene expression. A small but growing number of independent international research groups have begun to speculate that the mechanisms underlying the persistence of these changes are Epigenetic marks; Stable but potentially reversible alterations in gene expression that occur without changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Some epigenetic processes are linked to the chromatin (i.e., DNA, histone proteins, and other associated proteins), commonly involve chemical modifications (e.g. methylation) and operate at as on or off switches at the level of transcription, while others (e.g. miRNA) may fine-tune gene expression post-transcriptionally. Results: In our latest research publication (Laufer et al. Disease Models & Mechanisms 2013), we used four ethanol treatment protocols to model developmental ethanol exposure in mice: injections at 3 specific neurodevelopmental time points that model a "binge" exposure, and a voluntary maternal consumption model, which represents a moderate and chronic exposure throughout development. We then assessed small RNA brain gene expression in resulting adult offspring (PD 70) using miRNA expression arrays, gene expression arrays, and qPCR. The analysis revealed that a large number of microRNAs are altered, both up and down, depending on treatment paradigm. Some of these expression profiles are unique to a treatment protocol while others overlap. Strikingly, approximately 20% of the altered noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) localized to three imprinted clusters. The first two, Snrpn-Ube3a (Human 15q11-q13) and Dlk1-Dio3 (Human 14q32.2), are associated with processes involved in neuronal plasticity and several neurodevelopmental disorders that include schizophrenia, autism, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman Syndrome. Next, we assessed brain DNA methylation using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to DNA arrays (MeDIP-Chip), which revealed that even moderate fetal alcohol exposure has a genome-wide effect on DNA methylation, with PTEN/AKT/mTOR/PI3K signaling and imprinted regions of the genome appearing to be particularly sensitive. More recent results from our group have examined the hippocampal formation and confirmed brain region specificity of these results via analysis of gene expression, miRNA and snoRNA regulation, and DNA cytosine methylation. Histone modifications and trans-generational studies are a current avenue of investigation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that imprinted ncRNAs, which play critical roles in neurodevelopment and brain function, may have a role in the long-term maintenance of altered gene expression and cognitive endophenotypes associated with FASD. Discussion: Current research from our group is examining how environmental conditions; both enriched and deprived, affect disease development. This presentation will conclude with our current efforts to translate these results to create a diagnostic molecular profile in humans, which may then be used by clinical researchers to establish therapeutic attenuations, given the highly dynamic nature of epigenetic marks.

N2  - Introduction: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is characterized by Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). IUGR models show dysfunctional maternal uterine vascular adaptations. We hypothesized that chronic binge alcohol during pregnancy impairs uterine artery function via endothelialdependent mechanisms. Methods: A chronic binge alcohol paradigm was followed in the rats (peak blood alcohol concentration, 248 +/- 82.3 mg/dl, gestation day (GD) 7-17 or 19). On the day after the last alcohol exposure, uterine artery function was studied using wire myography. Alteration to endothelial function was also validated using cultured ovine uterine artery endothelial cells (GD 120-130; term = 147) with an alcohol dose and duration similar to the in vivo studies. Results: In rats, no growth deficits were observed on GD 18, whereas by GD 20 fetal body (21%, P=0.002) and placental weights (22%, P=0.001) decreased in the alcohol group. No differences in uterine artery contraction was noted in response to phenylephrine (group effect, P=0.4; logEC50, -6.02+/-0.02 vs. -5.94+/-0.03) or thromboxane (group effect, P=0.73; logEC50, -8.08+/-0.17 vs. -7.98+/-0.17). Further, alcohol did not alter endotheliumindependent SNP-induced relaxation (group effect, P=0.65; logEC50, -7.68+/-0.05 vs. -7.61+/-0.04). Alcohol selectively impaired uterine endothelium-dependent relaxation; acetylcholine significantly decreased vessel relaxation (dose and group main effect, P<0.01; logEC50, -7.02+/-0.14 vs. -6.53+/-0.35; Emax, 14%). Endothelium dysfunction was also noted in uterine endothelial cell culture system; binge alcohol decreased levels of major endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS, rate limiting enzyme for NO vasodilator production) excitatory P635eNOS/total eNOS (23%, P<0.003) compared to the Controls and the related pERK/total ERK signaling (25.7%, P<0.001). Discussion: 1) Chronic binge alcohol has detrimental effects on agonist-mediated endothelium-dependent uterine artery relaxation during pregnancy; 2) These data support that uterine vascular dysfunction precedes FASD growth deficits; 3) Chronic binge alcohol has specific effects on uterine eNOS activity and related signaling; 4) Ongoing studies will investigate role of NO, prostacyclin, and endothelium dependent hyperpolarizing factor in alcohol-induced decreases in uterine vascular function; 5) These findings suggest the involvement of the uterine compartment in FASD pathogenesis.

N2  - Alcohol exposure during pregnancy results neurodevelopmental and learning abnormalities and affects 1/100 deliveries. Neuroprotective proteins (NAP,SAL) have been shown to prevent some of the alcohol-induced sequelae including learning abnormalities and growth restriction. Previous work has demonstrated that when evaluated at 30min, 60min and 10days after exposure, phosphorylation of the JNK and p38 cell signaling pathways were affected by alcohol exposure in pregnancy. Given the acute changes in phosphorylation we sought to evaluate the impact of alcohol and NAP+SAL after 5 and 10 minutes of exposure, in cellular signaling pathways involved in stress/cell death (JNK, p38) and those that regulate cellular growth, survival and differentiation (STAT, MAP/ERK, CREB). We used the well characterized Webster mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnancy was identified by vaginal plug and treatment with alcohol, alcohol+NAP,SAL (20ug IP) or placebo(saline) were administered on gestational day 8. Embryos were harvested after 5 or 15min. Cell signaling pathways were studied using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore) and normalized to total protein concentration. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with Fishers post hoc for multiple comparisons; P<.05 significant. Prenatal alcohol exposure affects phosphorylation in the embryo at 5 and 15min with alterations in JNK in the embryo at both timepoints compared with controls (both P<0.01). Pretreatment with NAP+SAL returned levels to control at 15min. Phosphorylation of other pathways although significant at 5min, was not dramatically different, however at 15min a persistent pattern of alterations with alcohol treatment decreasing levels (all P<.01) with no improvement with the peptides, these included CREB, IL1b, p38, p70 and STAT3. Alcohol exposure stimulates the cellular signaling pathways involved in stress/cell death (JNK, p38) decreases those that regulate cellular growth, survival and differentiation. Targeting these pathways may provide an intervention for alcohol induced damage in pregnancy. (Figer Presented) .

N2  - Introduction: A cardinal feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). IUGR models show dysfunctional uterine vascular adaptations. Although alcohol has pregnancy-specific effects on both the maternal systemic & uterine endothelium, large scale quantitative proteomic studies are lacking. Objective: We utilized ITRAQ-label based method & nanoLC MS/MS to quantitate alcohol-induced alterations in the maternal uterine endothelial proteome. Methods: Uterine artery endothelial cells from pregnant ewes (Day 120-130; term=147), were FAC sorted, validated, & cultured. To mimic maternal binging patterns, 4 pairs of cell lines derived from 4 pregnant ewes were treated for 3 h on 3 days in a compensating system without or with alcohol (300 mg/dl) for 2 weeks. Lysates were TCA precipitated, solubilized, trypsin digested before addition of isobaric ITRAQ tags. Following SCX fractionation, samples were analyzed by nano LC MS/MS (MS Bioworks). Data were searched using MASCOT, quantitated & analyzed by Student's t test using Scaffold Q+. Results: Cell viability was unaltered by alcohol. Independent of treatment, a total of 363 proteins were detected with >2 unique peptides/protein & 0% false discovery rate (FDR). Of the 31 proteins significantly (P<0.05) altered by alcohol, 14 were upregulated () & 17 downregulated (). These proteins include those related to cell structure (eg. tubulin beta, P=0.002; vimentin, P<0.001), transcription & translation regulation (eg. elongation factor 1alpha, P<0.001; 40S ribosomal protein S19, P=0.002; calreticulin, P=0.004), histones (eg. H4, P<0.001; H2B-1k, P=0.036), Ca+2/nitric oxide (NO) (eg. HSP90beta, P=0.014; calmodulin, P<0.001), & redox balance (eg. thioredoxin, P=0.017). In addition to 100% FDR in these analyses, we also performed gel based 2-D Dige analysis. Conclusions: 1) This is the first study to utilize the well established ITRAQlabeled technology for proteomic analyses on any cell type in FASD field; 2) Chronic binge alcohol has specific effects on the maternal uterine vasculature at the level of the endothelial proteome; 3) The data support binge alcohol effects at multiple levels including epigenetic, transcriptional & translational; 4) Alcohol has major effects on proteins related to redox balance & Ca+2/NO regulation; & 5) These findings support a role for the uterine compartment in FASD pathogensis.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to a wide range of neurodevelopmental impairments in children and adults including behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In rhesus monkeys, we examined whether moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure would alter acoustic startle responses and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle. PPI is a highly quantifiable measure of inhibitory neural processes or sensorimotor gating associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Methods: Acoustic startle and PPI of the acoustic startle were tested in 37 adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from 4 experimental conditions: (i) moderate-level prenatal alcohol-exposed, (ii) prenatally stressed, (iii) moderate-level prenatal alcohol-exposed + prenatally stressed, and (iv) sucrose controls. Results: Prenatal alcohol-exposed monkeys showed a higher magnitude of acoustic startle response and disrupted PPI compared with monkeys not exposed to alcohol prenatally. Monkeys in all conditions showed higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis responses after undergoing the startle procedure, but HPA responses were unrelated to startle response magnitude, latency, or PPI. Conclusions: Finding altered PPI in monkeys prenatally exposed to a moderate dose of alcohol suggests that reduced sensorimotor gating is 1 effect of prenatal alcohol exposure. Because reduced sensorimotor gating is observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders, sensorimotor gating deficits could be an aspect of the comorbidity between fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and mental health conditions. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Alcohol use disorders (AUD) during pregnancy can have profound lifelong effects on the baby, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Hospital admission for AUD during pregnancy provides an opportunity for intervention. Characterization of women along the AUD spectrum during pregnancy aids the development of prevention strategies, policy, and clinical management guidelines aimed at this population. This study describes the hospital admission levels for AUD between the sixth month before pregnancy and the first year after birth and explores risk factors associated with the hospital admissions. Methods: This study was based on linked population data between 2002 and 2005 using the New South Wales (NSW) Midwives Data Collection (MDC) and the NSW Admitted Patients Data Collection (APDC), Australia. The study subjects included primiparous mothers who were admitted to hospital in the period from the sixth month before pregnancy to 1 year after birth with at least 1 of the following diagnoses (ICD-10-AM): mental and behavioral disorders due to the use of alcohol (MBDA) (F10.0-10.9); toxic effects of alcohol (T51.0-51.9); maternal care for suspected damage to fetus from alcohol (O35.4); or alcohol rehabilitation (Z50.2). Results: A total of 175 new mothers had 287 hospital admissions with the principal or stay AUD diagnoses during the study period in NSW. Of the 287 admissions, 181 admissions (63.07%) were reported for an alcohol-related disorder as the principal diagnosis. The hospital admission rate for AUD was 1.76/1,000 person-years (PY) (95% CI: 1.45 to 2.07) during the 6 months prepregnancy. The rate decreased to 0.49/1,000 PY (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.63) during pregnancy and to 0.82/1,000 PY (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.97) in the first year after birth. Women who smoked during pregnancy, lived in a remote area and were younger than 25 years, were more likely to be admitted to hospital with AUD diagnoses. Women in the middle disadvantaged quintile and born in other countries were less likely to be admitted to hospital with AUD diagnoses. Conclusions: Hospital admission for AUD decreased significantly in pregnancy and the first year postpartum compared to the prepregnancy period. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: While much FASD research has focused on sociological, behavioural, and neuro-structural changes, prenatal alcohol exposure also results in longterm alterations in gene expression. A small but growing number of independent international research groups have begun to speculate that the mechanisms underlying the persistence of these changes are Epigenetic marks; Stable but potentially reversible alterations in gene expression that occur without changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Some epigenetic processes are linked to the chromatin (i.e., DNA, histone proteins, and other associated proteins), commonly involve chemical modifications (e.g. methylation) and operate at as on or off switches at the level of transcription, while others (e.g. miRNA) may fine-tune gene expression post-transcriptionally. Results: In our latest research publication (Laufer et al. Disease Models & Mechanisms 2013), we used four ethanol treatment protocols to model developmental ethanol exposure in mice: injections at 3 specific neurodevelopmental time points that model a "binge" exposure, and a voluntary maternal consumption model, which represents a moderate and chronic exposure throughout development. We then assessed small RNA brain gene expression in resulting adult offspring (PD 70) using miRNA expression arrays, gene expression arrays, and qPCR. The analysis revealed that a large number of microRNAs are altered, both up and down, depending on treatment paradigm. Some of these expression profiles are unique to a treatment protocol while others overlap. Strikingly, approximately 20% of the altered noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) localized to three imprinted clusters. The first two, Snrpn-Ube3a (Human 15q11-q13) and Dlk1-Dio3 (Human 14q32.2), are associated with processes involved in neuronal plasticity and several neurodevelopmental disorders that include schizophrenia, autism, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman Syndrome. Next, we assessed brain DNA methylation using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to DNA arrays (MeDIP-Chip), which revealed that even moderate fetal alcohol exposure has a genome-wide effect on DNA methylation, with PTEN/AKT/mTOR/PI3K signaling and imprinted regions of the genome appearing to be particularly sensitive. More recent results from our group have examined the hippocampal formation and confirmed brain region specificity of these results via analysis of gene expression, miRNA and snoRNA regulation, and DNA cytosine methylation. Histone modifications and trans-generational studies are a current avenue of investigation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that imprinted ncRNAs, which play critical roles in neurodevelopment and brain function, may have a role in the long-term maintenance of altered gene expression and cognitive endophenotypes associated with FASD. Discussion: Current research from our group is examining how environmental conditions; both enriched and deprived, affect disease development. This presentation will conclude with our current efforts to translate these results to create a diagnostic molecular profile in humans, which may then be used by clinical researchers to establish therapeutic attenuations, given the highly dynamic nature of epigenetic marks.

N2  - Background: The Lililwan Project is the first population-based study to determine Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) prevalence in Australia and was conducted in the remote Fitzroy Valley in North Western Australia. The diagnostic process for FASD requires accurate assessment of gross and fine motor functioning using standardised cut-offs for impairment. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2) is a norm-referenced assessment of motor function used worldwide and in FASD clinics in North America. It is available in a Complete Form with 53 items or a Short Form with 14 items. Its reliability in measuring motor performance in children exposed to alcohol in utero or living in remote Australian Aboriginal communities is unknown.Methods: A prospective inter-rater and test-retest reliability study was conducted using the BOT-2 Short Form. A convenience sample of children (n = 30) aged 7 to 9 years participating in the Lililwan Project cohort (n = 108) study, completed the reliability study. Over 50% of mothers of Lililwan Project children drank alcohol during pregnancy. Two raters simultaneously scoring each child determined inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was determined by assessing each child on a second occasion using predominantly the same rater. Reliability was analysed by calculating Intra-Class correlation Coefficients, ICC(2,1), Percentage Exact Agreement (PEA) and Percentage Close Agreement (PCA) and measures of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were calculated.Results: Thirty Aboriginal children (18 male, 12 female: mean age 8.8 years) were assessed at eight remote Fitzroy Valley communities. The inter-rater reliability for the BOT-2 Short Form score sheet outcomes ranged from 0.88 (95%CI, 0.77 - 0.94) to 0.92 (95%CI, 0.84 - 0.96) indicating excellent reliability. The test-retest reliability (median interval between tests being 45.5 days) for the BOT-2 Short Form score sheet outcomes ranged from 0.62 (95%CI, 0.34 - 0.80) to 0.73 (95%CI, 0.50 - 0.86) indicating fair to good reliability. The raw score MDC was 6.12.Conclusion: The BOT-2 Short Form has acceptable reliability for use in remote Australian Aboriginal communities and will be useful in determining motor deficits in children exposed to alcohol prenatally. This is the first known study evaluating the reliability of the BOT-2 Short Form, either in the context of assessment for FASD or in Aboriginal children. © 2013 Lucas et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Brief, effective interventions are needed to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy in women who drink and do not use effective contraception. The Healthy Choices study compared telephone and in-person administration of a brief intervention. In addition to indicators of alcohol use and effective contraception, compliance with the intervention was examined. Women between the ages of 18 and 44 who were drinking above recommended levels and not using effective contraception were randomly assigned to either a telephone (n= 68) or in-person (n= 63) brief (two sessions) intervention. Overall, participants showed small but significant reductions in alcohol use and larger increases in effective use of contraception. Risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancy was thus significantly reduced, largely due to improved contraception with minor reductions in alcohol use. There was no significant difference in success of the intervention between the two conditions (telephone versus in-person). These findings suggest telephone-based brief intervention may be equally successful and cost-effective in reducing the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy and thus fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2013.

N2  - The failure of education to significantly reduce the incidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome has made it important to understand the mechanisms in order to develop preventative or ameliorative strategies. Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to be associated with altered fetal blood flow, oxidative stress and growth restriction that can persist into adolescence. Low birth weight is also associated with altered development and programming which can have lifelong consequences. Glutamine has been linked with fetal nitrogen and carbon metabolism, synthesis of the cellular anti-oxidant glutathione, and apoptosis suppression. It is a precursor for the synthesis of other amino acids, endothelial-dependent relaxation, and increases in protein synthesis and is used clinically as a nutrient supplement in low birth weight infants. We hypothesized that chronic third trimester-equivalent prenatal alcohol exposure would decrease the bioavailability of amino acids, hamper fetal body growth, increase fetal cerebellar oxidative stress, and alter fetal blood flow; a corollary hypothesis was that maternal L-glutamine supplementation may improve these negative developmental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to 4 groups: saline control, glutamine (GLN) control, alcohol or alcohol + GLN. Alcohol or saline infusions were given intravenously (IV) over 1 h from gestation day (GD) 109 to 132 or from GD99 to 121, 3 consecutive days per week to mimic a weekend binge drinking pattern. 100 mg/kg of GLN dose was administered IV as a 4.5 %w/v aqueous bolus three times a day. Third trimester equivalent prenatal alcohol exposure reduced fetal weight and height and also increased the ponderal index compared to the control group; these parameters were significantly improved in the alcohol + GLN group compared to the alcohol group. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreased fetal plasma concentrations of arginine, aspartate, glutamine, taurine and tyrosine; maternal glutamine supplementation improved the bioavailability of amino acids in both the maternal and fetal compartments. We observed a decrease in oxidized glutathione in maternal hemocytes and the fetal cerebellum for the alcohol + GLN group compared to the alcohol group. Fetal cerebellar blood flow was significantly increased in the alcohol group, hence increasing the cerebellar alcohol delivery. This alcohol-induced increase in fetal cerebellar blood flow was mitigated in the alcohol + GLN group. In summary, maternal glutamine supplementation improved amino acid bioavailability, fetal growth and endogenous antioxidant levels in alcohol exposed fetuses. Thus, glutamine shows great potential as a therapeutic or intervention strategy for the negative effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is a major, preventable cause of neurobehavioral dysfunction in children worldwide. The measurement and quantification of saccadic eye movements is a powerful tool for assessing sensory, motor, and cognitive function. The quality of the motor process of an eye movement is known as saccade metrics. Saccade accuracy is 1 component of metrics, which to function optimally requires several cortical brain structures as well as an intact cerebellum and brain-stem. The cerebellum has frequently been reported to be damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. This study, therefore, tested the hypothesis that children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) will exhibit deficits in the accuracy of saccades. Methods: A group of children with FASD (n = 27) between the ages of 8 and 16 and typically developing control children (n = 27) matched for age and sex, completed 3 saccadic eye movement tasks of increasing difficulty. Eye movement performance during the tasks was captured using an infrared eye tracker. Saccade metrics (e.g., velocity, amplitude, accuracy) were quantified and compared between the 2 groups for the 3 different tasks. Results: Children with FASD were more variable in saccade endpoint accuracy, which was reflected by statistically significant increases in the error of the initial saccade endpoint and the frequency of additional, corrective saccades required to achieve final fixation. This increased variability in accuracy was amplified when the cognitive demand of the tasks increased. Children with FASD also displayed a statistically significant increase in response inhibition errors. Conclusions: These data suggest that children with FASD may have deficits in eye movement control and sensory-motor integration including cerebellar circuits, thereby impairing saccade accuracy. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Early identification of and intervention for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has been shown to optimize outcomes for affected individuals. Detecting biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in neonates may assist in the identification of children at risk of FASD enabling targeted early interventions. Despite these potential benefits, complicated ethical issues arise in screening for biomarkers of PAE and these must be addressed prior to the implementation of screening programs. Here, we identify and comment, based on a North American perspective, on concerns raised in the current ethical, social, and legal literature related to meconium screening for PAE. Major ethical concerns revolve around the targeting of populations for PAE screening, consent and respect for persons, stigma and participation rates, the cost-benefit analysis of a screening program, consequences of false-positive and false-negative test results, confidentiality and appropriate follow-up to positive screen results, and the use of screen results for criminal prosecution. We identify gaps in the literature on screening for PAE, most notably related to a lack of stakeholder perspectives (e.g., parents, healthcare providers) about screening and the ethical challenges it presents. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, can result in craniofacial dysmorphism, cognitive impairment, sensory and motor disabilities among other defects. FASD incidences are as high as 2% to 5 % children born in the US, and prevalence is higher in low socioeconomic populations. Despite various mechanisms being proposed to explain the etiology of FASD, the molecular targets of ethanol toxicity during development are unknown. Proposed mechanisms include cell death, cell signaling defects and gene expression changes. More recently, the involvement of several other molecular pathways was explored, including non-coding RNA, epigenetic changes and specific vitamin deficiencies. These various pathways may interact, producing a wide spectrum of consequences. Detailed understanding of these various pathways and their interactions will facilitate the therapeutic target identification, leading to new clinical intervention, which may reduce the incidence and severity of these highly prevalent preventable birth defects. This review discusses manifestations of alcohol exposure on the developing central nervous system, including the neural crest cells and sensory neural placodes, focusing on molecular neurodevelopmental pathways as possible therapeutic targets for prevention or protection. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Alcohol is a known teratogen that is estimated to affect 2-5% of the births in the U.S. Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce physical features such as facial dysmorphology, physiological alterations such as cell loss in the central nervous system (CNS), and behavioral changes that include hyperactivity, cognitive deficits, and motor dysfunction. The range of effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure is referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Despite preventative measures, some women continue to drink while pregnant. Therefore, identifying interventions that reduce the severity of FASD is critical. This study investigated one such potential intervention, vitamin D3, a nutrient that exerts neuroprotective properties. The present study determined whether cholecalciferol, a common vitamin D3 nutritional supplement, could serve as a means of mitigating alcohol-related learning deficits. Using a rat model of FASD, cholecalciferol was given before, during, and after 3rd trimester equivalent alcohol exposure. Three weeks after cholecalciferol treatment, subjects were tested on a serial spatial discrimination reversal learning task. Animals exposed to ethanol committed significantly more errors compared to controls. Cholecalciferol treatment reduced perseverative behavior that is associated with developmental alcohol exposure in a dose-dependent manner. These data have important implications for the treatment of FASD and suggest that cholecalciferol may reduce some aspects of FASD. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: Chronic prenatal alcohol exposure can injure the developing brain, and is associated with a variety of physiological and behavioural postnatal anomalies, collectively referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Included among the anomalies is a markedly increased prevalence of seizures. To date, there exists limited information regarding the underlying mechanisms. The hippocampus is a structure implicated in the FASD and is a source of seizure activity in a variety of epileptic conditions. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in mice on the physiology and seizure susceptibility of the hippocampus. Method: Pregnant mice received 10% v/v ethanol for the first trimester of gestation by voluntary consumption. Extracellular field potentials were recorded from the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions using acute brain slices prepared from control and ethanol-exposed pups of age PD 15 to PD 21. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure for the first trimester resulted in an increase of spontaneous field activity in both the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions. These spontaneous discharges consist of depolarizing shifts of 0.2-1 mV in amplitude and 30-150 ms in duration, which were blocked by the addition of the gap junctional communication antagonist, carbenoxolone. Furthermore, prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in an increase in spontaneous and recurrent seizures in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions. Along with the physiological changes we observed molecular changes in FASD mice, including up-regulation of connexin 30 mRNA and connexin 30 protein compared to age-matched controls. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that exposure of the developing brain to alcohol results in abnormal physiological and molecular changes and an increase in seizure susceptibility in the hippocampus.

N2  - Presentation A 32-year-old woman booked her second pregnancy at the local district hospital. Her first pregnancy and delivery were unremarkable. Investigation The anomaly scan was undertaken at 20 weeks and 2 days, where all measurements were found to be on the fifth centile. A referral was made to the Consultant Obstetrician, and serial scans demonstrated the growth velocity to be maintained on the fifth centile, but the head circumference well below the third centile at 21, 23 and 26 week scans. Uterine dopplers were normal, as were liquor volume and umbilical dopplers. A fetal echocardiogram was performed. An amniocentesis was normal. A fetal brain MRI was undertaken at 28 weeks, which demonstrated delayed sulcation and a small brain. After counselling, the couple opted for a fetocide, followed by induction at 33 weeks, and a male infant was born weighing 1075 g and head circumference of 25 cm. A minimally invasive postmortem revealed normal development, other than isolated microcephaly with an immature brain for gestational age, of undetermined aetiology. Discussion Microcephaly is defined when the head circumference is measured to be smaller than expected for gestational age. The threshold at which diagnosis is made varies between authors; it is usually defined as a head perimeter measurement of -3 SD or less below the mean. Minus 2 SD is also sometimes used but will incorporate a proportion of fetuses with a small head circumference but normal development. It is primarily a disorder of cell proliferation in the cortex rather than the bones of the cranium. The forebrain is most affected and there can be other associated abnormalities including asymmetries and atrophy of the basal ganglia. The diagnosis is primarily pathogenetic. Once the diagnosis has been made, other abnormalities are sought as microcephaly may exist as part of a syndrome or an isolated finding. The causes of microcephaly include chromosomal abberations and gene defects, the result of infection (such as rubella, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis) and environmental toxins including fetal alcohol syndrome. A family history of microcephaly or other possible genetic syndromes should be taken, along with a history of exposure to viral illness and alcohol consumption. Conclusion Diagnosis on ultrasound can be challenging, and accurate gestational age is required. Head perimeter is used, and the cranial vault appears small compared with the facial bones. The forehead may have a sloping appearance. Dilated lateral ventricles can also suggest microcephaly in the context of borderline head perimeter.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Objective: To investigate the relationship between maternal alcohol-use disorder and dental hospital admissions in children up to 5 years of age. Study design: Mothers with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision/10th revision alcohol-related diagnosis, a proxy for alcohol-use disorder, were identified through the Western Australian data-linkage system. Exposed mothers were frequency-matched by maternal age, Aboriginal status, and child's birth year to randomly selected comparison mothers without an alcohol diagnosis. Linkage with the Midwives Notification System (1983-2002) identified all births of these mothers; "exposed" (non-Aboriginal, n = 11 171; Aboriginal, n = 8145) and comparison cohorts (non-Aboriginal, n = 32 508; Aboriginal, n = 16 719). Dental hospital admissions were identified through linkage with Hospital Morbidity Data (1983-2007) (3.2% exposed; 3.0% comparison) and cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (n = 84) through linkage with the Western Australian Register of Developmental Anomalies. ORs and 95% CIs for having a dental admission (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision: 520-529; International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision: K0-K14.9) were generated by the use of generalized estimating equations, which we adjusted for potential confounding factors (aOR). Results: Children of mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis had increased adjusted odds of gingivitis and periodontal diseases (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.12-2.51) and "other" diseases of the lip and oral mucosa (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.21-2.01). Diseases of the salivary glands were increased only in Aboriginal children of mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis (aOR 2.65; 95% CI 1.09-6.44). Children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome had increased ORs of any dental admission (aOR 2.58; 95% CI 1.30-5.11). Conclusions: Maternal alcohol-use disorder was associated with dental admissions related to disorders of the soft tissues, but questions remain regarding perinatal influences on dental admissions and disease.

N2  - Aims: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a very common and completely avoidable disease caused by intrauterine alcohol exposition. FAS has severe consequences not only for the individual and its direct environment but also for the health and social system in Germany. The first aim of the project is the determination of evidence-based, clinically relevant and implementable diagnostic criteria for the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome in children and adolescents in Germany. With help of the defined diagnostic criteria of FAS the disorder can be diagnosed and treated earlier, so secondary disorders can be reduced. The second aim is to create awareness in the German society about the severe complications of alcohol use in pregnancy in order to reduce the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and diminish the incidence of FAS. Methods: A steering group in Munich and a consensus group consisting of representatives of the German Federal Ministry of Health, the German Professional Societies and other FAS experts have been established in 2011. Representatives of the Patient Support Group FASworld are also members of the consensus group. For the methodological guidance the AWMF (Consortium of the scientific medical societies) is responsible and the literature evaluation is conducted by the AZQ (Center for Quality in Medicine). Results: The consensus group defined a key question and specific issues for the literature search. The evaluation of the literature is in progress. The methodological quality of the international and especially the German publications about the diagnostic criteria are rather poor. Most of the existing international guidelines for the diagnosis of FAS are consensus- but not evidence-based. Conclusion: There is great need for a standardized, multidisciplinary, quality assured and implementable prevention of FAS in Germany. The first step is the establishment of evidence- and consensus-based diagnostic criteria for children with FAS which will be approved and presented in 2012.

N2  - Alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) are the direct cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). This study examines drinking patterns among pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing age in Russia, a country with one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world. Cross-sectional survey. Seven public women's clinics in two locations: St Petersburg (SPB) and the Nizhny Novgorod region (NNR). A total of 648 pregnant and non-pregnant childbearing-age women. A face-to-face structured interview assessed alcohol consumption, pregnancy status/possibility of becoming pregnant and consumption before and after pregnancy recognition. Eighty-nine per cent of non-pregnant women reported consuming alcohol and 65% reported binge drinking in the past 3 months; 47% in NNR and 28% in SPB reported binges at least monthly. Women who might become pregnant consumed alcohol similarly to women who were not likely to become pregnant, and 32% of women in SPB and 54% in NNR were categorized as at risk for AEP. There was a significant decline in drinking after pregnancy identification. Twenty per cent of pregnant women reported consuming alcohol and 6% in SBP (none in NNR) reported binge drinking; however, a high prevalence of binge drinking was found among women who might become pregnant or who were trying to conceive. Russian women substantially reduce drinking after pregnancy recognition compared to pre-pregnancy levels. No reductions were found prior to pregnancy recognition, either when a woman might become pregnant or when she was trying to conceive. The pre-conception period presents a risk window and, therefore, a prevention opportunity. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.

N2  - Human birth defects are highly variable and this phenotypic variability can be influenced by both the environment and genetics. However, the synergistic interactions between these two variables are not well understood. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is the umbrella term used to describe the wide range of deleterious outcomes following prenatal alcohol exposure. Although FASD are caused by prenatal ethanol exposure, FASD are thought to be genetically modulated, although the genes regulating sensitivity to ethanol teratogenesis are largely unknown. To identify potential ethanol-sensitive genes, we tested five known craniofacial mutants for ethanol sensitivity: cyp26b1, gata3, pdgfra, smad5 and smoothened. We found that only platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (pdgfra) interacted with ethanol during zebrafish craniofacial development. Analysis of the PDGF family in a human FASD genome-wide dataset links PDGFRA to craniofacial phenotypes in FASD, prompting a mechanistic understanding of this interaction. In zebrafish, untreated pdgfra mutants have cleft palate due to defective neural crest cell migration, whereas pdgfra heterozygotes develop normally. Ethanol-exposed pdgfra mutants have profound craniofacial defects that include the loss of the palatal skeleton and hypoplasia of the pharyngeal skeleton. Furthermore, ethanol treatment revealed latent haploinsufficiency, causing palatal defects in ~62% of pdgfra heterozygotes. Neural crest apoptosis partially underlies these ethanol-induced defects in pdgfra mutants, demonstrating a protective role for Pdgfra. This protective role is mediated by the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Collectively, our results suggest a model where combined genetic and environmental inhibition of PI3K/mTOR signaling leads to variability within FASD. © 2013.

T1  - A potential molecular target for morphological defects of fetal alcohol syndrome: Kir2.1
A1  - Bates E.A.
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a developmental disorder that affects up to 0.2% of births. FASD comprises severe cognitive and structural birth defects including cleft lip/palate, small jaw, wide-set eyes, dental abnormalities, digit abnormalities, small head, and short stature. Strict counseling guidelines stress abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy, but the prevalence of FASD persists. The lack of a convincing molecular target has hindered FASD research and treatment. Interestingly, mutations in an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1, cause a similar constellation of birth defects as in FASD. In other words, FASD phenocopies the traits conveyed by Kir2.1 mutations. Furthermore, alcohol directly binds to and modulates Kir2.1. Substantial evidence now suggests that alcohol targets Kir2.1 to cause the birth defects associated with FASD. This review compiles clinical, genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological, and molecular evidence that identifies Kir2.1 as a molecular target for FASD development and possibly therapeutic treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - A derived peptide from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) has been shown to be neuroprotective in the fetal alcohol exposure model. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 against alcohol-induced apoptosis using TUNEL staining. We further characterize in this study the proteomic architecture underlying the role of ADNF-9 against ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic days 7-13 (E7-E13) to a 25% ethanol-derived calorie [25% EDC, Alcohol (ALC)] diet, a 25% EDC diet simultaneously administered i.p. ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9), or a pair-fed (PF) liquid diet. At E13, fetal brains were collected from 5 dams from each group, weighed, and frozen for LC-MS/MS procedure. Other fetal brains were fixed for TUNEL staining. Administration of ADNF-9 prevented alcohol-induced reduction in fetal brain weight and alcohol-induced increases in cell death. Moreover, individual fetal brains were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Statistical differences in the amounts of proteins between the ALC and ALC/ADNF-9 groups resulted in a distinct data-clustering. Significant upregulation of several important proteins involved in brain development were found in the ALC/ADNF-9 group as compared to the ALC group. These findings provide information on potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 in the fetal alcohol exposure model.

N2  - Although children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure may exhibit the distinctive facial dysmorphology seen in full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), many lack that dysmorphology. This study examined the functional organization of working memory in the brain in three groups of children-those meeting diagnostic criteria for FAS or PFAS, heavily exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children, and healthy controls. A verbal n-back task (1-back and 0-back) was administered to 47 children (17 with FAS/PFAS, 13 HE, and 17 controls) during fMRI. Intra-group one-sample t-tests were used to identify activity regions of interest central to verbal working memory including the dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC), inferior frontal gyrus, caudate/putamen, parietal cortex, and cerebellar Crus I/lobule VI and lobule VIIB-IX. Whereas groups did not differ in task sensitivity, fMRI analyses suggested different patterns of sub-network recruitment across groups. Controls primarily recruited left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). By contrast, HE primarily recruited an extensive set of fronto-striatal regions, including left dPFC and left caudate, and the FAS/PFAS group relied primarily on two cerebellar subregions and parietal cortex. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate differential recruitment of critical brain regions that subserve basic function in children with different fetal alcohol spectrum disorders compared to controls. The distinct activation patterns seen in the two exposed groups may be related to substantial differences in alcohol dose/occasion to which these groups were exposed in utero.

N2  - High numbers of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) have been described as having mental health problems. This article summarizes research about mental health problems in FASD and considers related developmental and environmental issues. A computer-based literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Academic Search Complete, and Education Resources Information Centre for articles addressing the prevalence and types of mental health issues in individuals affected by FASD. High rates of mental disorders within the FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) population were found to be consistently reported for both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Moreover, problems that emerge in childhood may reflect a convergence of genetic, environmental, and neurophysiological factors that persist into adulthood. Researchers are beginning to document the impacts of PAE on later mental health development. Further longitudinal study is needed to determine whether there is an increasing severity of mental health deficits and consequences with age, and whether any such changes reflect increasingly deteriorating environmental factors or brain-based factors. Additionally, research is needed to design interventions to better address the unique mental health needs of this population.

N2  - Craniofacial bone dysmorphology is an important but under-explored potential diagnostic feature of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. This study used longitudinal MicroCT 3D imaging to examine the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on craniofacial bone growth in a mouse model. C57BL/6J dams were divided into 3 groups: alcohol 4.2% v/v in PMI liquid diet (ALC), 2 weeks prior to and during pregnancy from embryonic (E) days 7-E16; pair-fed controls (PF), isocalorically matched to the ALC group; chow controls (CHOW), given ad libitum chow and water. The MicroCT scans were performed on pups on postnatal days 7 (P7) and P21. The volumes of the neurocranium (volume encased by the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones) and the viscerocranium (volume encased by the mandible and nasal bone), along with total skull bone volume, head size, and head circumference were evaluated using general linear models and discriminant analyses. The pups in the alcohol-treated group, when compared to the chow-fed controls (ALC vs CHOW) and the isocaloric-fed controls (ALC vs PF), showed differences in head size and circumference at P7 and P21, the total skull volume and parietal bone volume at P7, and volume of all the tested bones except nasal at P21. There was a growth trend of ALC<CHOW and ALC
CHOW), and the total skull, parietal bone, and occipital bone at P21 (ALC<CHOW, ALC<PF). While covarying for the P7 measures, the treatment affected only the 3 neurocranial bones at P21 (ALC<CHOW, ALC<PF). Discriminant analysis sensitively selected between ALC and CHOW (AUC=0.967), between ALC and PF (AUC=0.995), and between PF and CHOW (AUC=0.805). These results supported our hypothesis that craniofacial bones might be a reliable and sensitive indicator for the diagnosis of prenatal alcohol exposure. Significantly, we found that the neurocranium (upper skull) was more sensitive to alcohol than the viscerocranium (face). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: During late prenatal and early postnatal life, the reproductive system in males undergoes an extensive series of physiological and morphological changes. Prenatal ethanol (EtOH) exposure has marked effects on the development of the reproductive system, with long-term effects on function in adulthood. The present study tested the hypothesis that prenatal EtOH exposure will delay the onset of spermatogenesis. Methods: Development of the seminiferous tubules and the onset of spermatogenesis were examined utilizing a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Male offspring from ad libitum-fed control (C), pair-fed (PF), and EtOH-fed (prenatal alcohol exposure [PAE]) dams were terminated on postnatal (PN) days 5, 15, 18, 20, 25, 35, 45, and 55, to investigate morphological changes through morphometric analysis of the testes from early neonatal life through young adulthood. Results: PAE males had lower relative (adjusted for body weight) testis weights compared with PF and/or C males from PN15 through puberty (PN45). In addition, fewer gonocytes (primordial germ cells) were located on the basal lamina on PN5, while more of those touching the basal lamina were dividing in PAE compared with PF and C males, suggesting delayed cell division and migration processes. As well, the percentage of tubules with open lumena was lower in PAE compared with PF and C males on PN18 and 20, and PAE males had fewer primary spermatocytes per tubule on PN18 and round spermatids per tubule on PN25 compared with C males. Finally, the percentage of tubules at stages VII and VIII, when mature spermatids move to the apex of the epithelium and are released, was lower in PAE compared with PF and/or C males in young adulthood (PN55). Conclusions: Maternal EtOH consumption appears to delay both reproductive development and the onset of spermatogenesis in male offspring, with effects persisting at least until young adulthood. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - We explored differences in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors across six groups of professionals in key position to provide primary and secondary prevention efforts (physicians, educators, correctional staff, social workers, public health nurses, and substance abuse counselors). Achieving a 60.1% response rate, 2,292 professionals returned surveys, providing data on basic knowledge of FAS, FASD-associated risks and cognitive deficits, and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women. Across groups, findings revealed ample FASD knowledge and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women that increases as consumption becomes more frequent and severe. However, results revealed significant between-group differences data that provide valuable guidance for targeted future FASD education efforts. Public health initiatives regarding FASD have been effective in increasing knowledge among a broad range of professionals. However, between-group differences indicate the need for targeted, discipline-specific interventions. These differences highlight the need for all professional groups to provide a consistent public health message regarding maternal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Jones et al in 1973 described the prenatal alcohol exposure and the correlation with facial malformations, growth restriction, cognitive and behavioral problems as the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). But the first time that the correlation of the pregnant woman with alcohol consumption and the bad infant outcome referred was by Aristotles 2.350 years ago. Alcohol consumption had increased in the contemporary world. In USA 7.6% of the pregnant women drink alcohol during pregnancy. In Europe the problem is worst, especially in northern countries that 1% pregnant women are heavy addicted with alcohol. 25-50% of the women who drink alcohol continued alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In our country, in a very recent study, Karavitakis and al found that 20% of the Cretan pregnant women consume alcohol. The 13% had mild consumption (1 standard drink, 1 time/week). The women who drink alcohol in this study were the most educated, with the higher income and older age. From the above it is obvious that FAS is not uncommon and May et al considered an incidence of 0.2-2 per 1000 live births. In order to describe the large range of adverse outcomes, they proposed the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Stratton et al in 1996 defined the 5 diagnostic categories of FASD. These are, FAS with confirmed or not alcohol exposure, partial FAS with confirmed alcohol exposure, alcohol related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). The accurate history of prenatal exposure to alcohol is the main and crucial issue for the diagnosis of the FASD, but this is not always possible. The existing biomarkers as the levels of fatty acid ethyl esters in meconium and hair are difficult to be utilized in the clinical practice. The most common phenotype at birth includes low centile of OFC and BW and withdrawal symptoms. During infancy and early childhood, facial deformities (thin upper lip, short palpebral fissures, disappearance of lip philtrum, epicanthic folds, clinodactyly, nail hypoplasia), microcefaly, growth failure, intellectual disability, behavior problems and speech difficulties, were presented. Chromosomal imbalances may have similar to FASD phenotypes. So it is important the role of clinical geneticist in these cases. Fanconi anaemia, Smith-Lemi-Opitz syndrome, Stickler syndrome, Kabuki syndrome, Turner syndrome, has features which overlap with FASD. Chromosomal microarray analysis is useful to identify alternative diagnosis with similar phenotype as 22q11 deletions, which occurs of around 1 in 8000. Alcohol can damage a fetus at any stage of pregnancy. Damage can occur in the earlier weeks of pregnancy even before a woman knows that she is pregnant, and that time the fetus is particularly susceptible to alcohol exposure due to organogenesis,. Conclusions: No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered as safe during pregnancy. Even low amounts of alcohol during early pregnancy increases, the risk of spontaneous abortion substantially. For all these reasons a pregnant woman should not drink alcohol during pregnancy.

N2  - Ethanol consumption during pregnancy is a widespread problem which is increasing in the generation of young women. Gestational alcohol consumption causes fetal exposure to this teratogen and is associated with the onset of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FASD and FAS can lead to several physical, cognitive and behavioral disabilities, whose early diagnosis is of primary importance to perform primary prevention with total abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and secondary prevention in newborns and children for a proper follow up to reduce risk of secondary consequences. In recent years significant efforts have been made to understand the underlying mechanisms of this disease and to identify objective biological and instrumental diagnostic tools, such as exposure biomarkers in neonatal meconium and advanced magnetic resonance imaging. Nonetheless, further studies are still needed to implement our knowledge on fetal effects of ethanol, and multidisciplinary actions are necessary to raise awareness among women of childbearing age about the danger of consuming even small amounts of ethanol during pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The study investigated prenatal alcohol consumption and knowledge of alcohol risks and fetal alcohol syndrome among Korean women. The participants were 221 Korean women who attended the post-partum care centers in Seoul, Korea. The data included the participants' background characteristics, quantity-frequency typology, Student Alcohol Questionnaire, and a scale on the participants' knowledge of fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol was consumed during pregnancy by 12.7% of the participants. Of these, 60.7% drank alcohol with their spouse. A few participants reported that nurses identified their drinking habits and gave them information on alcohol consumption and fetal alcohol syndrome. Most of the participants did not have the opportunity for prenatal counseling about fetal alcohol syndrome. The knowledge level regarding alcohol risks and fetal alcohol syndrome among the participants was poor. Alcohol consumption before pregnancy was significantly related to prenatal alcohol consumption. Prenatal alcohol consumption was not related to knowledge about alcohol consumption and fetal alcohol syndrome. The assessment of alcohol consumption and counseling about alcohol are needed for pregnant women in order to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

N2  - The highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome worldwide can be found in South Africa. Particularly in impoverished townships in the Western Cape, pregnant women live in environments where alcohol intake during pregnancy has become normalized and interpersonal violence (IPV) is reported at high rates. For the current study we sought to examine how pregnancy, for both men and women, is related to alcohol use behaviors and IPV. We surveyed 2,120 men and women attending drinking establishments in a township located in the Western Cape of South Africa. Among women 13.3% reported being pregnant, and among men 12.0% reported their partner pregnant. For pregnant women, 61% reported attending the bar that evening to drink alcohol and 26% reported both alcohol use and currently experiencing IPV. Daily or almost daily binge drinking was reported twice as often among pregnant women than non-pregnant women (8.4% vs. 4.2%). Men with pregnant partners reported the highest rates of hitting sex partners, forcing a partner to have sex, and being forced to have sex. High rates of alcohol frequency, consumption, binge drinking, consumption and binge drinking were reported across the entire sample. In general, experiencing and perpetrating IPV were associated with alcohol use among all participants except for men with pregnant partners. Alcohol use among pregnant women attending shebeens is alarmingly high. Moreover, alcohol use appears to be an important factor in understanding the relationship between IPV and pregnancy. Intensive, targeted, and effective interventions for both men and women are urgently needed to address high rates of drinking alcohol among pregnant women who attend drinking establishments.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can alter physical and behavioral development, leading to a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Despite warning labels, pregnant women continue to drink alcohol, creating a need to identify effective interventions to reduce the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects. Choline is an essential nutrient that influences brain and behavioral development. Recent studies indicate that choline supplementation can reduce the teratogenic effects of developmental alcohol exposure. The present study examined whether choline supplementation during prenatal ethanol treatment could mitigate the adverse effects of ethanol on behavioral development. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated with 6 g/kg/day ethanol in a binge-like manner from gestational days 5-20; pair-fed and ad libitum chow controls were included. During treatment, subjects from each group were intubated with either 250 mg/kg/day choline chloride or vehicle. Spontaneous alternation, parallel bar motor coordination, Morris water maze, and spatial working memory were assessed in male and female offspring. Subjects prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibited delayed development of spontaneous alternation behavior and deficits on the working memory version of the Morris water maze during adulthood, effects that were mitigated with prenatal choline supplementation. Neither alcohol nor choline influenced performance on the motor coordination task. These data indicate that choline supplementation during prenatal alcohol exposure may reduce the severity of fetal alcohol effects, particularly on alterations in tasks that require behavioral flexibility. These findings have important implications for children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Alcohol exposure in pregnancy is a common and modifiable risk factor for poor pregnancy and child outcomes. Alcohol exposure in pregnancy can cause a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems in the child including the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). In order to improve prevention strategies, we sought to describe the knowledge and attitudes of women of childbearing age regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus. We conducted a national cross-sectional survey via computer assisted telephone interview of 1103 Australian women aged 18 to 45 years. Participants were randomly selected from the Electronic White Pages. Pregnant women were not eligible to participate. Quotas were set for age groups and a minimum of 100 participants per state to ensure a national sample reflecting the population. The questionnaire was based on a Health Canada survey with additional questions constructed by the investigators. Descriptive statistics were calculated and logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations with participants' knowledge and attitudes. Of women surveyed, 61.5% had heard about effects of alcohol on the fetus and 55.3% had heard of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Although 92.7% agreed alcohol can affect the unborn child, 16.2% did not agree that the disabilities could be lifelong. Most women agreed that pregnant women should not drink alcohol (80.2%) and 79.2% reported having negative feelings towards pregnant women drinking alcohol. Women with higher education levels were more likely to know the effects of alcohol consumption in pregnancy (adjusted OR 5.62; 95% CI 3.20 to 9.87) but education level and knowledge were not associated with attitude. There was a disjunction between knowledge and attitudes towards alcohol consumption in pregnancy. These findings will assist in developing effective health promotion campaigns to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and subsequent fetal damage.

N2  - Psychological distress (PD) includes symptoms of depression and anxiety and is associated with considerable emotional suffering, social dysfunction and, often, with problematic alcohol use. The rate of current PD among American Indian women is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of U.S. women in general. Our study aims to fill the current knowledge gap about the prevalence and characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems among American Indian mothers whose children were referred to screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data was conducted from maternal interviews of referred American Indian mothers (n = 152) and a comparison group of mothers (n = 33) from the same Plains culture tribes who participated in an NIAAA-funded epidemiology study of FASD. Referred women were from one of six Plains Indian reservation communities and one urban area who bore children suspected of having an FASD. A 6-item PD scale (PD-6, Cronbach's alpha = .86) was constructed with a summed score range of 0-12 and a cut-point of 7 indicating serious PD. Multiple statistical tests were used to examine the characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems. Referred and comparison mothers had an average age of 31.3 years but differed (respectively) on: education (<high school: 47.4%, 9.1%), PD-6 mean scores (3.57, 1.48), current prevalence of serious PD (19.1%, 0.0%), and a current drinking problem (31.6%, 12.1%). Among referred mothers, those with a current drinking problem had a significantly higher mean PD-6 score. Having PD, serious PD, and 2 specific scale items significantly increased the odds that a referred mother would have a current drinking problem. Psychological distress among referred mothers is significantly associated with having a self-reported drinking problem. FASD prevention requires multi-level prevention efforts that provide real opportunities for educational attainment and screening and monitoring of PD and alcohol use during the childbearing years. Mixed methods studies are needed to illuminate the social and cultural determinants at the base of the experience of PD and to identify the strengths and protective factors of unaffected peers who reside within the same communities.

N2  - In the last 40 years a vast mass of clinical, epidemiological and experimental evidence has demonstrated that alcohol is a teratogenic agent and that its consumption during gestation can cause foetal death, malformations and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in the exposed fetus. The most dramatic presentation is the complete foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is observed in children born from heavy alcohol consuming mothers. FAS and of other fetal alcohol-related effects was reported in both USA and Europe in the middle 80 s. However, despite these evidences, many European countries have largely forgotten or minimize the risks associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. Thirty years later, new epidemiological and clinical studies as well as new biomarkers of fetal-alcohol damage have identified high risk populations and have provided data demonstrating that significant number of women in the EU drink during pregnancy. In September of 2009, a conference on 'ALCOHOL AND PREGNANCY' was organized sponsored by the Swedish Presidency of the European Union, to discuss political interventions in the EU concerning this question. I briefly summarize here the discussions, presentations and the prevention programs of some European countries. The main conclusion of the conference was that we need more information and prevention programs to improve prevention of the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption during gestation.

N2  - Background: A battery of clinical assessments was used in the Lililwan* Project, Australia's first population-based Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) prevalence study, conducted in the remote Fitzroy Valley, Western Australia. One objective was to develop and assess test-retest reliability of an acceptable questionnaire for collecting health information in remote Aboriginal communities feasible for use in the Lililwan Project.Methods: A questionnaire was developed by paediatricians to assist in diagnosis of FASD. Content was based on a literature review of FASD diagnostic criteria, existing questionnaires and risk factors for FASD and birth defects. Aboriginal community members, including qualified Aboriginal language interpreters, adapted the questionnaire to ensure language and cultural components were appropriate for use in the Fitzroy Valley. Locally developed pictorial aids were used for gathering accurate information on alcohol use. Aboriginal 'community navigators' assisted researchers to translate the questions into Kimberley Kriol or local Aboriginal languages depending on participant preference.A subset of 14 questions was assessed for test-retest reliability in 30 parents/carers of children in the Lililwan Project cohort, who were interviewed by one rater using the entire questionnaire, then by a second rater who repeated 14 critical questions at least 6 hours later.Results: The full questionnaire contained 112 items and took 50 minutes to administer. For a subset of 14 items from the full questionnaire percent exact agreement between raters ranged from 59-100%, and was below 70% for only 1 question. Test-retest reliability was excellent (Kappa 0.81-1.00) for 5 items, substantial (Kappa 0.61-0.80) for 5 items, and moderate, fair or slight (Kappa <0.60) for the remaining 4 items tested. Test-retest reliability for questions relating to alcohol use in pregnancy was excellent. When questions had moderate, fair or slight agreement, information was obtained from alternate sources e.g. medical records. Qualitative feedback from parents/carers confirmed acceptability of the questionnaire.Conclusions: This questionnaire had acceptable test-retest reliability and could be used to collect demographic, socio-cultural and biomedical information relevant to the diagnosis of FASD in Aboriginal communities throughout Australia and elsewhere. Community input is crucial when developing and administering questionnaires for use in cross-cultural contexts.*Lililwan is a Kimberley Kriol word meaning 'all the little ones'.

N2  - Background: Accurate confirmation of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is required as a diagnostic criterion for the majority of children adversely affected by PAE who do not manifest the physical features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. A number of ethanol biomarkers have been used to assess PAE, often with suboptimal results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and cost of PAE screening in newborns by measuring phosphatidylethanol (PEth) in dried blood spot (DBS) cards. Methods: The feasibility of collecting an additional DBS card during routine newborn screening and the background prevalence of PAE were evaluated in a de-identified sample of newborn children delivered at the University of New Mexico Hospital. Electronic orders to collect DBS cards from newborns who continue to bleed after the routine newborn screen, glucose, or hematocrit testing were initiated for all infants delivered during a 4-week time frame. Specimens were sent to a contract laboratory for PEth analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A cost analysis was conducted to compare the cost of PAE screening by PEth in DBS versus PEth in conventional blood specimens and by meconium fatty acid ethyl esters. Results: From 230 collected cards, 201 (87.4%) had at least 1 full blood spot (amount sufficient for PEth analysis), and 6.5% had PEth >20 ng/ml indicative of potential PAE in late pregnancy. PAE screening by PEth in DBS is logistically simpler and less expensive compared with 2 other screening approaches. Conclusions: These results indicate that screening for PAE in DBS cards is a feasible procedure and that a majority of infants have enough blood after the routine heel prick to fill an additional card. Moreover, screening by PEth analysis from DBS cards is cost-efficient. The acceptability of such screening by parents and corresponding ethical issues remain to be investigated. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain development are well documented in infants, children, and adolescents, but the long-term effects into adulthood are poorly understood. We present here the neuropathologic findings in a 34-year-old woman with an early childhood diagnosis of FAS. In addition to the characteristic FAS facial dysmorphia and cognitive impairments, the patient's course was notable for multiple psychiatric manifestations, with co-morbid diagnoses of schizophrenia (with auditory hallucinations), depression, and anxiety. The patient died of an acute pulmonary embolism. At autopsy, the brain was mildly underweight (1150 grams). The cerebral hemispheres demonstrated a simplified gyral pattern and mild underdevelopment of the lateral temporal lobes with striking bilateral clefts between the superior and middle temporal gyri. Histologically, there was an apparent paucity of neurons (both granular and pyramidal) in the temporal cortex, and mild asymmetric hippocampal rotation. The corpus callosum, subcortical nuclei, cerebellum, and brainstem were unremarkable. The ventricles were not enlarged. There were no acquired changes, e.g., infarcts. Moreover, neuronal loss and/or gliosis were not detected in the gray matter structures, and there was no evidence of destructive lesions in the white matter. The analysis of this case provides the unique opportunity to determine the phenotype of the human brain that was exposed to prenatal alcohol more than three decades before death and in which secondary diseases, e.g., atherosclerosis with infarcts, were not present to obscure the phenotype. The primary process appears to be static and malformative without evidence of secondary degenerative lesions, e.g., neuronal loss, over time. While clefts of the temporal lobe have not been reported in FAS, excessive cortical thickness of the lateral temporal gyri and asymmetry of the hippocampi have been described. The relationship of these lesions involving the limbic system to comorbid psychiatric disease in older individuals with FAS is unknown.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are conditions caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in amounts sufficient to cause permanent deficits in brain functioning. Extent of damage largely depends on timing, dose, frequency, and pattern of exposure. Timing is especially important because prenatal alcohol exposure during critical periods of gestation can affect brain development in ways that produce varying patterns of neurocognitive deficits and associated adaptive impairments. This article describes some of the more serious neurophysiological and neuropsychological sequelae of prenatal alcohol exposure that contribute to increased risk for substance abuse problems among people with an FASD. We discuss the unique interface between pharmacological treatment and FASD, noting that failure to consider the possibility of FASD in treatment planning may result in treatment failure and/or relapse. Finally, we present a clinical case example and recommend service accommodations to address some of the impairments in FASD that limit substance abuse treatment success.

N2  - One critical clinical challenge in the fetal alcohol research field is the need to develop more sensitive and reliable biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure that might also serve as predictors of functional brain damage in newborns, allowing for earlier identification of children at risk for longer-term adverse neurobehavioral consequences. Using genomic approaches, we reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy dierentially aects placental and fetal cortical gene expression, including genes coding for proteins associated with nervous, vascular and immune system development. Given the critical role of angiogenesis in both placental function and brain development, we have focused subsequent studies on the impact ofmoderate prenatal ethanol exposure on the expression of four placental proteins associated with angiogenesis. These proteins were measured in both placenta and fetal cortex along with an assessment of cerebral cortical microvascular development. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0%or 5%ethanol solution in 0.066%saccharin water for four hours each day throughout gestation. The mean daily ethanol consumption of 2.72 g/ kg, which produces a peak maternal serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL, did not aectmaternal weight gain, litter size, placental or fetal body weight. On GD20, rat placental:fetal units were removed by Caesarian section and both placenta and cerebral cortex were processed for western blotting analysis. In addition, fetal frontal cortices were evaluated for vascular density in the cortical plate (CP), intermediate zone (IZ), and ventricular zone (VZ) layers. Moderate drinking during pregnancy significantly decreased the expression of cerebral cavernous malformation protein 3 (CCM-3) and inhibin A in both placental and cerebral cortical tissues. In contrast, the levels of annexin A4 and neuropilin 2 were significantly increased in placenta, but not significantly dierent in cerebral cortex. Prenatal ethanol exposure decreased vascular density in all three layers of cerebral cortex. The reduction was statistically significant in the ventricular zone. These results provide preliminary evidence regarding the prospect of using a biosignature pattern of ethanol-induced alterations in placental proteins associated with angiogenesis as a biomarker for altered microvascular development, a process critical for normal brain development and function.

N2  - Alcohol (ethanol) drinking during pregnancy has become a major health and social concern. It has been linked to a wide range of birth-related defects and abnormal behaviors in ospring. In this study, we examined the eect of prenatal alcohol exposure on voluntary alcohol consumption and brain CB1 receptor using alcohol binge model that has been shown to produce a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The pregnant C57BL/6J mice were given alcohol (2.9 g/kg, two doses, 4 hrs apart, i.g.) on gestation days 7 and 8, while control mice received isocaloric maltose-dextrin solution. The results indicate increase in CB1 receptor expression in prefrontal cortex and alcohol consumption (10%v/v) in alcohol exposed adult ospring compared to control groups. Pharmacological antagonismof CB1 receptor function with either SR141716A or AM4113 (a dose of 3 mg/kg body wt. i.p.) significantly decreased alcohol consumption in alcohol exposed ospring. These results suggest that alcohol exposure during gestation day 7 and 8 dysregulates the function of eCB system and increases alcohol consumption in adult ospring. The eCB system might serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of some of the behavioral deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare the nutritional status ofmothers of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) with randomly-selected mothers of children without an FASD. One hundred and seventy-eight mothers (57 mothers of children with FASD and 121mothers with children without FASD) from a community in theWestern Cape Province of South Africa completed 24- hour dietary recall interviews. Data were analyzed with the Nutrition Data System for Research. Using a timeline, follow-back technique, each woman reported how current dietary intake compared to intake during her pregnancy with the index child. Dierence ofmeans tests compared the intake for macronutrients (total grams, fat, carbohydrate, protein, cholesterol, and fiber) andmicronutrients (vitamin A,D,E,K,C,B-complex, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, selenium, sodium, potassium, omega-3s, eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), docosapentanoic acid (DPA) and docshexanoic acid (DHA)) between the Dietary Recommended Intake (DRI) for pregnant women 19-30. Further analyses were made comparing subgroups.Mothers of children with an FASD, alcohol exposed controls, and unexposed controls. Statistical analysis indicated that: compared to DRI, with the exception of vitamin B12, selenium, and sodium, all mothers (FASD and control) were significantly deficient on all micronutrients (p < .000). While all mothers weremicronutrient deficient compared to DRI, mothers of children with FASD in this sample consumed, on average, higher amounts ofmicronutrients than mothers of randomlyselected controls. Analyses of specific micronutrient intake dierences betweenmothers of FASD and control children are ongoing at the time of the abstract preparation, but will be presented. Despite no statistical dierence in the total gram intake, mothers of randomly-selected controls had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) than mothers of children with FASD. These results support previous studies which indicate that people who consume large quantities of alcoholmay be at an additional nutritional disadvantage because chronic alcohol use can cause malabsorption or altered metabolism of nutrients. These results confirm the importance of BMI as one co-factor of risk for FASD, and suggest that nutritional status of the mother may have a direct or indirect eect on the fetus. And poor nutrition could be a co-factor that exacerbates the hallmark characteristics of FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) causes lifelong cognitive deficits found in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) by impairing brain development.We recently showed that dietary prevention of gestational maternal iron deficiency (ID) lessens FASD's learning deficits. Our preliminary data suggest this is due, in part, because alcohol inhibits the fetus from correctly interpreting maternal iron status, thus preventing the proper homeostatic adaptations between the ID fetal brain and liver. In adults, alcohol dysregulates iron homeostasis and suppresses the synthesis of hepcidin, the "master regulator" of iron homeostasis and a potent anti-inflammatory peptide. The consequences of hepcidin dysregulation during gestation to fetal development and its iron-sensing ability are unknown.We investigated this question using a 2nd trimester rat gestational PAEmodel (5 g/kg/d) under conditions of maternal iron suciency (IS) and ID.We evaluated gestational day 20.5 fetal brain, fetal liver, andmaternal liver using real-time PCR for the expression of hepcidin and pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa). Unexpectedly, rather than reducing hepcidin, as in adult alcoholics, PAE increased hepcidin production in both maternal and fetal liver, but not in fetal brain, during both IS and ID. PAE also increased IL-1b and TNFa expression under both IS and ID in fetal liver, brain, and maternal liver. These increases were additive in fetal brain and indicated a feed-forward inflammatory loop driven by alcohol. Additionally, in alcohol's absence, maternal ID increased both IL-1b and TNFa in these fetal andmaternal tissues, as compared with maternal IS. As a whole, our data suggest that PAE during maternal ID causes a more dramatic disruption of fetal iron metabolismand inflammation compared to maternal IS, magnifying the proinflammatory state produced by PAE. A firmer understanding of the impact ofmaternal iron status on PAE's inflammatory action may inform prophylactic and therapeutic dietary interventions withmaternal iron supplementation to reduce the FASD's outcome severity in children.

N2  - Disruption of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated as an important molecular mechanism underlying alcohol (ethanol)-induced birth defects. Recently, haploinsuciency in the Hedgehog receptor Cdon was shown to synergize with prenatal alcohol exposure to produce the facial and brain abnormalities associated with severe forms of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Employing a mousemodel of FAS, the study reported herein was conducted to examine whether single allelemutations in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh; the dominant vertebrate Hh ligand) or Gli2 (the dominant transcriptional activator of the Hh pathway) alter the severity of alcohol-induced facial dysmorphology. Timed-pregnancies were established by mating wildtype C57Bl/6J female mice with Shh+/- or Gli2+/- (backcrossed to C57Bl/6J) malemice. On gestational day (GD)7, timed pregnant dams were treated with two IP doses of 2.9 g/kg ethanol (or vehicle alone), administered four hrs apart. GD17 fetuses were then removed and genotyped. Following rigorous alignment, frontal and sagittal images of each specimen were captured, fromwhich nine unique craniofacial measurements were performed. Vehicle treated wildtype and heterozygous animals were largely indistinguishable. However, relative to their wildtype alcohol-exposed littermates, Shh+/- and Gli2+/- alcohol-exposed ospring exhibited an increase in severity of FAS-associated facial features, including midfacial hypoplasia and hypotelorism.While Shh+/- and Gli2+/- mice have been described as phenotypically normal, this study illustrates a functional haploinsuciency of both genes in combination with alcohol exposure. Additionally, these results further support Hh signaling perturbation as amechanism underlying the pathogenesis of FAS while highlighting the significance of gene-environment interactions for the teratogenic endpoint.

N2  - Because the majority of children adversely aected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) do not present with the physical features characteristic of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, confirmation of maternal drinking is required both for diagnosing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and initiating interventions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to play an important role in the mechanisms underlying the deleterious eects of PAE and are appealing as novel biomarkers since they are very stable in plasma and serum and have shown great promise as biomarkers of cancer and other conditions. In this study we used Exiqon wholemiRome PCR plates to examine the levels of 766 human miRNAs in serum samples from 34 pregnant women (17 Alcohol-users [AU] and 17 abstinent controls [AC]) selected from a well-characterized cohort at UNM. Patients were recruited from a clinic that serves pregnant women with current or past history of substance abuse.Women classified as AU reported >3 drinks/week and/or binge drinking episodes during pregnancy and were positive for at least one conventional ethanol biomarker, whereas controls abstained from alcohol use during pregnancy per self-report and were negative for all ethanol biomarkers. All serum samples were collected at mid-gestation. We found that the levels of 184 of the 341 miRNAs that were detected in serum were significantly altered in the AU group vs. controls (p < 0.05). To validate these findings, a subset of the 12most promising miRNAs due their fold change dierences between the groups was selected and analyzed by individualmiRNA PCR assays. We found that twomiRNAs (miR-200a andmiR-1908) emerged as candidatemiRNAs associated with AU. Furthermore, the ratio of miR- 1908/miR-200a was significantly higher in the AU group compared to controls (p < 0.002). Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, we found that the combination of these miRNAs resulted in an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.83 (p < 0.001) indicative of high sensitivity and specificity.When a novel direct ethanol metabolite (phosphatidylethanol [PEth], measured in a dry blood spot cards of a newborn) was added to the panel, diagnostic accuracy of the test improved further (AUC = 0.95; p = 0.001). In conclusion, our results suggest that alterations in the levels of two serum miRNAs could be used to reliably detect alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to numerous adverse eects on the developing fetus. Theses teratogenic outcomes are termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which in the most severe cases lead to fetal alcohol syndrome. There is a high prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and hearing disorders in the FASD population. Thus, alcohol exposure in utero is a potential factor for the etiology and mechanisms of PAE-related seizures. Evidence indicates that PAE alters auditory brainstemresponses in rodent, and the alterations persist into adulthood. The inferior colliculus (IC), the generator of auditory brainstem response wave V, plays a critical role in the initiation of tonic-clonic seizures following alcohol withdrawal. Thus, alcohol-induced changes in IC neuronal excitability may contribute to the mechanisms of PAE-related seizures.We have previously reported that PAE enhances the current density of high threshold voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels including CaV2.3 (R-type) channels, which exhibit biophysical properties closer to that of low threshold CaV (CaV3 T-type) channels. Here, we examined the eects of PAE on T-type channel currents in dissociated IC neurons obtained from ospring (P3-P7). Pregnant rats received a single dose of 5 g/kg body weight ethanol (95%) as a 30%(v/v) solution in Isomil by gastric intubation at gestational day 18. Control animals received only Isomil. Currents were recorded in the whole cell patch clamp configuration. T-type currents weremeasured using 5 mMCa2+ as charge carrier during voltage steps to - 40 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV. Quantification shows that T-type current density was significantly elevated in IC neurons of ospring subjected to PAE. Pharmacological experiments to dissect T-type currents are in progress. These findings suggest that in addition to high threshold CaV channels, PAE also alters the low threshold CaV channels, which may play important roles in the pathophysiology of PAE-related disorders of neuronal excitability.

N2  - Introduction : Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is characterized by Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). IUGR models show dysfunctional uteroplacental vascular adaptations.We hypothesized that chronic binge alcohol results in uteroplacental vascular dysfunction by disrupting critical endothelial gestational adaptations. Methods: Maternal uterine vascular function was assessed utilizing wire myography following chronic binge alcohol administration in rats (peak blood alcohol concentration, 248 +/- 82.3 mg/dl, gestation day (GD) 7-17 or 19). Complementary proteomic approaches (2-D DIGE gel-based, iTRAQlabel-based, and label-free) and immunoblotting were used to delineate underlying mechanistic perspectives utilizing FAC sorted ovine uterine artery endothelial cells (GD 120-130; term = 147) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Results: Alcohol-induced uterine vascular dysfunction preceded fetal growth deficits (body weight, 21%, P = 0.002; placental weight, 22%, P = 0.001). No differences in uterine artery reactivity was noted in response to vasoconstrictors phenylephrine (P = 0.4) or thromboxane (P = 0.73), and to endothelium-independent dilator SNP (P = 0.65). Alcohol selectively impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation; acetylcholine significantly decreased vessel relaxation (dose and groupmain effect, P < 0.01; logEC50, -7.02 +/- 0.14 vs. -6.53 +/- 0.35; Emax, 14%). Complementary proteomic approaches showed that proteins associated with the key vasodilator nitric oxide (NO), and redox balances were affected (eg, HSP90b, P = 0.014; calmodulin, P < 0.001; thioredoxin, P = 0.017). Further, alcohol decreased levels of total endothelial NO synthase (eNOS, rate limiting enzyme for NOproduction) and excitatory P635eNOS/total eNOS (23%, P < 0.003) compared to the Controls and the related pERK/total ERK signaling (25.7%, P < 0.001). Discussion: (1) Chronic binge alcohol impairs endothelium-dependent uterine artery relaxation that is critical for gas and nutrient delivery to the fetus; 2) Uteroplacental vascular dysfunction precedes FASD growth deficits; 3) Alcohol negatively affects the chief uteroplacental vasodilator system (NO) and related signaling; 4) Rapid and high throughput quantitative proteomic platforms may be very helpful for FASD mechanistic insights, diagnosis, and to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies for FASD; 5) These findings suggest the involvement of the uteroplacental compartment in FASD pathogenesis.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Massive apoptosis of neurons resulting from exposure of the developing brain to alcohol is considered as the main cause of long-lasting structural CNS abnormalities and neuronal cell death by activation of pro-apoptotic caspase 3. We established an in vivo rat FAS model by feeding of 16-day pregnant rats with a 6.7%ethanol liquid diet until delivery.We demonstrate that the levels of proapoptotic caspase 3 and Bax were increased in the brain of pups from the ethanol group, while the early expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl2-associated athanogene-3 (Bag3) was inhibited by ethanol exposure. Bag3 plays an important role in protein quality control and the clearance of misfolded proteins in the developing brain. The level of glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b) playing an essential role in neural development was increased in relation to the decreased Bag3 in the ethanol-treated groups. During the period of Bag3 inhibition, the level of a GSK3b downstreamtarget, b-catenin, was also increased in the brain of ethanol-exposed pups, suggesting its accumulation in cells and dysregulation of b-catenin signaling that can possibly induce developmental brain defects. In vivo studies demonstrated a negative correlation between prenatal ethanol uptake and the development of the brain. Body and brain weight were significantly lower at P5 and P8 in the ethanol groups as compared to control groups, coinciding with low Bag3 expression. Behavioral observations at postnatal days P8 and P15 revealed hearing and feeding diculties and eye blink deficits in the ethanol group when compared to controls.We also found dysregulation of synaptophysin and genes that control synaptogenesis. These genes were also altered in an in vitro human FAS model, where we used primary neuronal culture and utilized a relevant concentration of ethanol (50 mM) for 24 hours. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that biphasic Bag3 expression (low in developing brain and increases with aging) is strongly inhibited by ethanol exposure. These changes were accompanied by alterations in key signaling pathways in the brain including early postnatal expression and accumulation of apoptosis-related and developmentally regulated proteins, neuronal loss and developmental delays later in life.

N2  - This study is a collaboration between Motherisk and theMaternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC), which collected meconiumsamples throughout Canada to measure environmental chemicals, but not alcohol. The focus of our study is to investigate the incidence of heavy fetal alcohol exposure bymeconium FAEE analysis in Canada, as well as correlating neonatal outcomes and fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) concentrations. FAEEs serve as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. Meconium was collected from 1537 newborns at 11 obstetric units across Canada and participatingmothers also completed questionnaires that contained a section focusing on alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. The questionnaires will serve as a maternal self-report and will be compared to meconium FAEE concentration. Any meconiumsample with a total FAEE concentration (the sum of ethyl palmitate, oleate, stearate and linoleate concentrations) greater than 2 nmol/g meconium is classified as positive for excessive alcohol consumption during the second and/or third trimesters of pregnancy. Additionally, neonatal and maternal outcomes were recorded and will be correlated with total and individual FAEE concentrations to determine any associations. MeconiumFAEE analysis of the samples by GC-MS is currently ongoing at theMotherisk Laboratory. This study is the first National study on heavy fetal alcohol exposure anywhere in the world. Because an estimated 40%of heavily alcohol-exposed fetuses exhibit FASD, this approach will yield the most accurate estimate of the incidence of FASD in Canada.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) is one of the most prominent causes of mental retardation in the developed world, as heavy alcohol consumption can cause gross structural and physiological abnormalities in the central nervous systemresulting in deficits in learning and memory processes. Heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome, while moremoderate consumption of ethanol causes more subtle physiological changes. Underlying many of learning and memory deficits observed in FAE are alterations in gene expression, which when properly characterized will lead to a better understanding of the neurological abnormalities occurring following exposure to alcohol during development. One important regulator of gene expression is the RNA binding protein HuD, which binds to and stabilizes transcripts containing a HuD binding site. This protein is important during development for proper axonal outgrowth and targeting, as well as during learning andmemory processes. For these experiments, pregnant Long-Evans rats were given 5% saccharin- sweetened ethanol in a voluntary exposure paradigm.Once the pups reached adulthood, the animals were sacrificed and hippocampi harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was then extracted and HuD mRNA levels analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. HuD mRNA levels in hippocampi from rats exposed to ethanol in utero were significantly lower than saccharin exposed control animals. These results suggest that FAE could be limiting HuD expression, which could have a number of downstream eecs. Lower basal expression levels of HuD in FAE could be one factor contributing to deficits in learning andmemory processes. HuD stabilizes a number of transcripts involved in long-term potentiation, so learning and memory deficits in FAE could also be a results of abnormal synaptic plasticity. Decreased HuD expression could also lead to changes in the expression of HuD RNA targets involved in hippocampal dependent memory, leading to a cascade of changes in gene expression that would have a profound impact on neural function.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce persistent adverse developmental outcomes, collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Despite the substantial research characterizing the brain injury and resultant neurodevelopmental disabilities, a significant gap still exists in providing coordinated, timely and eective care and supportive policies for children with FASD. Furthermore, relatively little research has been conducted on interventions that provide eective services for these children. The purpose of this research was to perform a needs assessment that could be used to develop a customized, internet-based intervention that provides families aected by FASD with the appropriate strategies tomanage challenging behaviours and to facilitate positive interactions. Sixty caregivers and 26 clinicians from across Canada were interviewed by telephone. The questions were open-ended and designed to gain insight into the behavioural and emotional problems associated with FASD, eective and ineective parenting strategies, as well as the skills needed to manage challenging behaviours. Caregivers reported that themost challenging behaviour categories were Externalizing Behaviours (most common subcategories: 1st temper tantrums/anger; 2nd violence/ aggression; 3rd impulsivity), Cognitive Diculties (most common subcategories: 1st memory; 2nd language problems; 3rd attention problems) and Social Diculties/Maladjustment (most common subcategories: 1st issues with playing; 2nd inability to filter; 3rd annoys/aggravates others). The most successful parenting strategies were Parental Reflection, Routine/Structure/ Consistency and Environmental Modification, while the use of Aggression, Unrealistic Expectations and Consequences and Rewards were the least eective. When caregivers were asked the best way to deliver assistance, the top response was Internet followed by Support Groups. Clinicians reported that Issues with Professional Institutes and Behavioural Diculties/Challenges were the most common concerns they heard from caregivers of children with FASD; and the major limitations in accessing services and supports were Lack of Knowledge, Awareness and Training, Services and Supports are not accessible and Services and Supports Do not Exist. These data will inform the development of the intervention program Strongest Families: FASD, which will provide a family-centered approach to training, education and support for children with FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with increased sleep problems which may aggravate the neurobehavioural problems in children with FASD. Treatment of sleep problems in these children is a challenge, at least partly due to an incomplete understanding of the specific nature of the problems. We have completed a study to develop and evaluate 2 intervention programs (a motor-skill development and a neurofeedback program) for children with FASD. One of the objectives of this study was to assess the nature and occurrence of sleep disturbances in participating children. Methods: The caregivers of 43 children with FASD filled out a questionnaire developed to survey sleep disturbances. The questionnaire assessed the prevalence and frequency of sleep disturbances, as well as specific problems with going to bed or falling asleep, and waking up during the night. Caregivers were also asked to rate the quality of life of themselves and their child (on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being highest), and to rate what the quality would be if the sleep problems were solved. Information was also collected on the use of melatonin, which is commonly used to treat problems with falling asleep. Results: Twenty-nine out of 43 children (67%) were reported to have sleep disturbances. Most (27 of 29) had problems going to bed or falling asleep, with 10 children experiencing problems every night and 12 experiencing problems 3-6 times weekly. Twenty children had problems with waking in the night, with 3 experiencing problems every night, and 4 experiencing problems 3-6 nights weekly. Of 26 respondents, 16 caregivers reported that their child's quality of life would improve if the sleep problems were solved, while 14 reported that their own quality of life would improve. Average quality of life scores were lower for the children with sleep disturbances (7.1+/- 2.0) and their caregivers (6.7+/-1.8), compared to children without sleep disturbances (8.0+/-2.0) and their caregivers (7.6+/-1.6), but these differences were not significant (p=0.166 for children, p=0.107 for caregivers). Twenty-four children had used melatonin for sleep problems, with 19 currently using melatonin. Only 13 caregivers had sought help from the medical systemfor their children's sleep issues. Conclusions: A high proportion of children with FASD experience frequent sleep disturbances, which are perceived by over half of caregivers to affect the quality of life of themselves and their children.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters the structure of specific brain regions, and these alterations correspond with a highly complex pattern of impairments in neurocognition, self-regulation, and adaptive functioning. However, very little is known about how PAE alters structural white matter connectivity among regions. Diusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a MRI technique that allows for the assessment of whitematter integrity by measuring restriction of water diusion known as fractional anisotropy (FA). Evidence from rodent models demonstrates that the development of myelination: 1) is reduced by PAE; and 2) begins earlier in females compared tomales. Similarly fromhuman studies, decreased integrity of several whitematter tracts were observed among individuals with a FASD compared to Controls. However, nothing is known about how the integrity of white matter tracts may dier between boys compared to girls with a FASD. In the current study, Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were utilized for analysis of DTI images in order to investigate tract integrity in FASD vs. Control boys and girls (ages 5 to 16 years). We hypothesized reduced integrity of whitematter tracts (lower FA) in FASD compared to Control participants, and that the eects of FASD on structural integrity will be sexually dimorphic. Independent t-tests were performed between each group and sex, and significance was determined by threshold-free clustering and a voxelwise significance of p<.05. Preliminary findings showed that youth with a FASD exhibit lower values of FA in frontal gyrus white matter. Interestingly, this eect was observed in opposite hemispheres between sexes, with reduced FA values occurring in the right hemisphere of FASD girls, but in the left hemisphere of FASD boys when compared to their sex matched Control peers. Interestingly, higher values of FA were observed in FASD compared to Control youth. Specifically, FASD girls had higher FA in the cerebellum, whereas FASD boys showed higher values in the posterior thalamic radiation, when compared to sex matched Controls. These novel findings provide evidence that PAE alters white matter microstructure in a sexually dimorphicmanner. Importantly, the present results have implications for understanding structural connectivity among regions that are implicated in cognitive, behavioral and mental health problems that occur at a high prevalence among individuals with an FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol has been linked to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) which includes a wide range of developmental deficits from non-detectable to severe mental retardation. Because women who abuse alcohol often ignore proper food intake, we investigate the contribution of nutritional disparity to FASD.We have previously observed that moderate alcohol and under-nourishment can independently cause partial and reversible facial dysmorphology, but moderate alcohol combined with under-nourishment exerted severe facial dysmorphology that could not be alleviated.We have also reported that DNA methylation is a programmed event playing a role in transcriptional regulation throughout neural development and that alcohol delays this epigenetic program and may contribute to FASD etiology. Because DNAmethylation depends on the availability ofmethyl donors, we set out to investigate the role of nutritional deficiency in alcohol-induced epigenetic alteration. Using an alcohol in liquid-diet mousemodel (4%v/v, across gestational days 7-17,) total free access nutrition was calorically matched to Chow controls but with 50-75%micronutrient deficiency. An alcohol-free isocaloric pair-fed (PF) control was also used. The cortices and cerebellumof all groups were immunostained with antibodies against DNA methylation markers 5-methylcytosine (5meC) and, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at postnatal day 7 and 21.We found that nutritional deficiency during gestation is independently capable of hindering the cell-specific DNA methylation program of the cerebellum which we have previously described. Specifically, nutritional deficiency was associated with an intranuclear reorganization of 5meC and 5hmC in addition to cellular growth restriction. Though this was also observed in alcohol-treated groups, nutritional deficiency exacerbated the eects of alcohol. This is in agreement with our long time observations of dysmorphogenesis at the rank of Alcohol> PF> Chow and further posits the question of whether nutritional supplementation can alleviate the burden of fetal alcohol. Preliminary evidence has indeed shown that nutritional supplementation can increase the daily intakes of liquid-diet of pregnant females. Due to the high incidence of nutritional insuciency associated with mothers who abuse alcohol during pregnancy, it is important to investigate the relationship between alcohol andmalnutrition further, as a step toward the development of a viable therapeutic.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal exposure to alcohol may negatively affect the developing brain with long term effects on development and behaviour. South Africa has a high prevalence of alcohol abuse and associated fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. A number of neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine systems are being implicated as underlying the association between maternal alcohol, and subsequent negative behavioural outcomes in offspring. In particular, the glutamatergic system, appears to be disrupted in offspring of rodent mothers exposed to stress. There has been relatively little work, however, on the glutamatergic system during early life in humans. This study aims to assess the effects ofmaternal alcohol use on infant neuronal integrity and glutamatergic function, as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Methods: Pregnant mothers in a Cape Town community were consented and further identified using the ASSIST questionnaire. Mothers screening positive for alcohol use in preganacy were administered a more detailed assessment of their alcohol use. Infants of these mothers as well as matched controls were assessed byMRS scan at 2-4 weeks of age performed during natural sleep. The MRS findings of index children were compared to that of the controls. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics committee. Results: Twenty eight infants aged between 2-4 weeks underwent MRS scans (12 controls, 15 alcohol-exposed infants, 1 infant was co-exposed to methamphetamines). Comparisons of group data on the findings from voxels placed over Parietal white matter (PWM) of infants exposed to alcohol prenatally showed significantly decreased Glx peak (Glu + Gln, p = 0.009) and significantly increased macromolecules and lipids (MM09 + Lip09, p = 0.007) (PWM nControl = 5, PWM nAlcohol=5).Parietal grey matter (PGM) of infants exposed to alcohol prenatally showed no significant differences (PGM nControl = 7, PWM nAlcohol=10). Discussion: This research advances understanding of the relevant mechanisms resulting in the neurological effects of alcohol and stimulant exposure. This may ultimately drive therapeutic approaches. The study offers an important opportunity to contribute to the protection of child health in South Africa and to further knowledge to benefit children in developing countries exposed to alcohol in pregnancy.

N2  - With Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) occurring in 2-5%of US live births, interventions are needed that assist women in reducing prenatal alcohol use to decrease the risk of FASD. This study determined the eectiveness of a single-session motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to decrease prenatal alcohol use. It also investigated the influence of self-determination theory mechanisms of basic psychological needs satisfaction and autonomous motivation on drinking behaviors. Of 184 women attending a prenatal visit (66%African American, mean age 25.4, mean weeks gestation 24.3), 122 women screened positive for previous year alcohol use asmeasured by the AUDIT or quantity/frequency measures of alcohol use. These women then completed the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS) and Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ) before randomization to an MI or comparison group. TheMI group received the intervention at the same or next prenatal visit. Both groups completed 30 day postbaseline (n = 92) and 30 day postpartum (n = 102) followups. Poisson regression using generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique to account for the repeated nature of the data found no significant main eects of MI on drink days per week, drinks per day, and total AUDIT scores. No interaction eects were noted, except for a significant interaction eect of MI on drink days per week showing the MI group to increase drink days per week, while the comparison group changed little across time. However, due to curvilinearity, strong caution is suggested when interpreting results. Linear regression using GEE did demonstrate a significant eect of time on BPNS and Relative Autonomy Index scores of the TSRQ with both increasing over time. In this study,MI was not found eective in decreasing prenatal alcohol use or in increasing basic psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivations to decrease prenatal alcohol use. However, future studies with increased numbers of data collection points would better allow interpretation and analysis of curvilinear relationships. Likewise, larger sample sizes with increased numbers of higher level drinkers would increase statistical power, as well as allow exploration of the eects of MI with women whose children are at higher risk for FASD. Additional sessions of the intervention, or booster interventions, are recommended to determineMI's ability to decrease prenatal alcohol use in the future.

N2  - This study aims to establish the incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure in the province of Prince Edward Island (PEI) in order to inform future public health initiatives addressing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. FASD in a leading preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disability in North America. Obtaining information about prenatal alcohol use in challenging via self-report due to the stigma associated with alcohol abuse in pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol exposure was investigated via population- based collection and analysis of meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE). FAEE are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol produced in the fetus and deposited into meconium. FAEE meconium concentrations greater than 2.0 nmol/g are indicative of frequent prenatal alcohol exposure during the last two trimesters of pregnancy. Meconium samples were collected from 1307 neonates born between November 2010 and November 2011 in hospitals on PEI or born to PEI-citizens giving birth at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Samples were frozen and shipped for analysis. FAEE were extracted via liquid-liquid extraction followed by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Four FAEE were quantified using deuterated internal standards; ethyl palmitate, ethyl linolate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate. Of 1307 samples collected, 1271 samples were successfully analyzed. Results were positive in 3.1%ofmeconium samples collected within the first twenty-four hours after delivery. It is estimated that approximately 40%of alcohol-exposed neonates will have FASD. This study suggests that approximately 1.3%of neonates born in the province will have FASD. This is the first province-wide study of fetal alcohol exposure conducted in Canada.

N2  - Purpose: Sensory processing impairments are reported frequently among children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). This pilot study aimed to validate previous clinical and behavioral findings by examining physiological reactivity to discrete, non-noxious sensory stimuli using the Sensory Challenge Protocol (SCP), a laboratory paradigm used with children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. Methods: Twenty-three children ages 5 through 11 years (11 with FASD; 12 with typical development and no prenatal alcohol exposure) participated in a two group comparison study. Sensory processing behaviors were measured by parent-report using the Short Sensory Profile (SSP; Dunn, 1999). Physiological reactivity to sensation was examined during the SCP using 1) electrodermal skin reactivity (EDR), 2) heart rate (HR), 3) heart rate variability (HRV) and 4) salivary cortisol levels taken at baseline, 15 and 30 minutes after the SCP. Results: Children with FASD showed significantly lower average EDR maximum amplitude during four of six sensory and the recovery conditions compared to controls. Significant differences in HRV change from baseline were detected in two of six sensory conditions and recovery. No significant group differences in heart rate outcomes or salivary cortisol levels at baseline or 15 and 30 minutes post SCP were found. Conclusions: Differential autonomic responses (EDR and HRV) to sensation and during recovery, but no differences in neuroendocrine responses, were found between children with FASD compared to controls without alcohol exposure. The direction and magnitude of these experimental differences require further investigation to understand the biobehavioral interplay between sensory reactivity and sensory processing behaviors among children with FASD.

N2  - Arithmetic has been identified as a particularly sensitive developmental endpoint for prenatal alcohol exposure. Our Detroit behavioral data suggest that fetal alcohol-related impairment in arithmetic is mediated primarily by a specific deficit in the core quantity systeminvolving the ability to mentally represent and manipulate number, a finding that we have confirmed in a Cape Town cohort. Five parietal regions are known to be critical in number processing: left and right horizontal intraparietal sulcus (IPS), left and right posterior superior parietal lobe (PSPL), and left angular gyrus (AG). IPS is activated in tasks involving relative quantities (magnitude representation), left AG during manipulation of numbers in verbal form. 59 right-handed children (age 7.9-13.4 yr) were administered fMRI tasks in Cape Town, South Africa. Prenatal alcohol exposure was assessed by maternal interview for oz absolute alcohol (AA)/day averaged across pregnancy, AA/drinking occasion, and drinking frequency. 14 children were diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS), 21 non-syndromal heavily exposed, and 24 controls whosemothers abstained or drank no more than minimally. fMRI data were acquired during exact addition (EA) (e.g.,"2 + 3 = 5 or 6?") and proximity judgment (PJ) (e.g.,"Is 5 closer to 4 or 7?"). Each of these self-paced tasks comprised 3 task (40s), 3 control (40s) and 3 rest blocks (20s), which were interleaved. Runs for which children scored <60% were excluded. fMRI regions of interest were defined as spheres, radius 6 mm. Because the tasks were simplified, the groups did not differ in accuracy on either task. However, the FAS/PFAS group completed fewer sums correctly during PJ (F(2,44)=3.40,p < 0.05). Increased AA/day and AA/occasion were associated with decreased activation in right IPS during both tasks (rs ranged from -0.36 to-0.38, ps<0.05). Although brain activation was not related to accuracy during EA, activity in left PSPL related inversely to accuracy on PJ (r = -0.55, p < 0.001). The reduced activation in right IPS is consistent with our previous behavioral findings suggesting a fetal alcohol-related specific deficit in representation and manipulation of quantity. Greater activation in left PSPL by children who perform the PJ task more poorly suggests that this regionmay be used to compensate for the reduced facility in magnitude representation in this group.

N2  - Background: Attention deficits are often observed in children with prenatal alcohol exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often diagnosed in this population. This study used an objective assessment tool to examine differences between alcohol-exposed and non-exposed children, with and without an ADHD diagnosis on core symptoms of ADHD: inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Method: Subjects (6-17y, M = 11.77) comprised four groups: alcohol-exposed with ADHD (AE+, n = 33), alcohol-exposed without ADHD (AE-, n = 19), non-exposed with ADHD (ADHD, n = 41), and non-exposed controls without ADHD (CON, n = 52). Subjects were evaluated with the Quotient ADHD System, which provides objective data on ADHD core symptoms. The system uses a motiontracking system to measure activity during a continuous performance task, measuring inattention and impulsivity. Data on six motion and six attention parameters were obtained and each dependent variable examined separately. Data were analyzed with a 2 (AE) x 2 (ADHD) between-subjects ANCOVA, using age as a covariate. Results: The AE x ADHD interaction was significant only for the number of commission errors (p = .040). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the average number of commission errors was significantly higher for the ADHD group compared to the CON and AE+ groups (p < .05). A significant main effect of ADHD diagnosis was observed on measures of omission errors, variability in response time, coefficient of variance, number of headmovements, distance, and area traveled (p < .05). The main effect of AE was significant on measures of omission errors, response latency, and variability in response time (p < .05). Conclusions: There was a high degree of similarity between alcohol-exposed children, regardless of ADHD diagnosis on this objectivemeasure of activity and attention. There was also a high degree of similarity between the AE groups and the non-exposed children with ADHD. However, impulsivity as measured by commission errors, was detected among the non-exposed children with ADHD but not in either alcohol-exposed group. Future studies should investigate the utility of the Quotient ADHD System in diagnosing individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and include expanded assessment of impulsivity, as thismeasure may aid in differential diagnosis of prenatal alcohol exposure versus ADHD due to other causes.

N2  - Background Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) comprises a triad of growth impairment, central nervous system dysfunction and characteristic facial features. Diagnosis is complex and often not recognised at an early age. The three facial features: short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip, are unique to FAS. Clinical examination is inherently subjective and apart from palpebral fissure length, minimal reference data is available in neonates. Establishing a standardised method and normal range would promote an objective assessment. Earlier diagnosis would enable earlier effective interventions. Methods Standardised digital facial photographs were taken of normal term Caucasian neonates. Mothers completed anonymous questionnaires about alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Photographs were assessed using Facial Analysis Software to obtain values for palpebral fissure length (PFL) and upper lip circularity (LC). Upper lip thinness and philtrum smoothness were ranked according to 5-point Likert Scale. Results 29 infants were studied, 17 male: 12 female. Mean gestational age 40.3 weeks (range 37.1-42.3), mean weight 3556g. 23 (79%) had no prenatal alcohol exposure whilst 6 had minimal exposure (1-2units/week). PFL measurements could be obtained from 21 photographs (72%) with mean of 15.6 mm (range 13.7-18.7mm). Upper lip and philtrum values could be determined in 24 (83%). Mean LC was 57.21 (range 31.4-128.2). Mean rank scores for upper lip and philtrum were both 3. Conclusion It has been possible to gain measurements of facial features in just over 3/4 of neonates studied, showing the feasibility of this technique in this age-group. Further results are needed to establish reference ranges.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure is the leading preventable cause of birth and developmental defects in the United States. Despite a growing body of knowledge about the spectrum of disorders resulting from fetal alcohol exposure, 1 in 9 pregnant women continues to drink alcohol during pregnancy, and a small percentage of pregnant women continues to binge drink. Health care providers do not consistently screen pregnant women for alcohol use, nor do health professionals necessarily know how to counsel pregnant women effectively about the risks of fetal alcohol exposure. In this article, we review the epidemiology of fetal alcohol exposure and discuss current strategies for screening and prevention of fetal alcohol exposure. We also explore the multiple barriers that exist toward reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancies from the patient, provider, and systems perspectives. Finally, we make recommendations for improved clinical and public health strategies to eliminate fetal alcohol exposure in the United States.Target Audience: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physiciansLearning Objectives: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to describe rates of fetal alcohol exposure in the United States, describe the demographic characteristics of women at highest risk for fetal alcohol exposure, counsel patients appropriately regarding the risk of poor fetal outcomes in association with fetal alcohol exposure, and understand the barriers to effective counseling about fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: The prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were determined in this fourth study of first-grade children in a South African community. Methods: Active case ascertainment methods were employed among 747 first-grade pupils. The detailed characteristics of children within the continuum of FASD are contrasted with randomly selected, normal controls on (i) physical growth and dysmorphology; (ii) cognitive/behavioral characteristics; and (iii) maternal risk factors. Results: The rates of specific diagnoses within the FASD spectrum continue to be among the highest reported in any community in the world. The prevalence (per 1,000) is as follows: fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)-59.3 to 91.0; partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS)-45.3 to 69.6; and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)-30.5 to 46.8. The overall rate of FASD is therefore 135.1 to 207.5 per 1,000 (or 13.6 to 20.9%). Clinical profiles of the physical and cognitive/behavioral traits of children with a specific FASD diagnosis and controls are provided for understanding the full spectrum of FASD in a community. The spectral effect is evident in the characteristics of the diagnostic groups and summarized by the total (mean) dysmorphology scores of the children: FAS = 18.9; PFAS = 14.3; ARND = 12.2; and normal controls, alcohol exposed = 8.2 and unexposed = 7.1. Documented drinking during pregnancy is significantly correlated with verbal (r = -0.253) and nonverbal ability (r = -0.265), negative behaviors (r = 0.203), and total dysmorphology score (r = 0.431). Other measures of drinking during pregnancy are significantly associated with FASD, including binge drinking as low as 3 drinks per episode on 2 days of the week. Conclusions: High rates of specific diagnoses within FASD were well documented in this new cohort of children. FASD persists in this community. The data reflect an increased ability to provide accurate and discriminating diagnoses throughout the continuum of FASD. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a congenital syndrome caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and is entirely preventable by abstinence from alcohol drinking during this time. Little is known about the prevalence of FAS and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Western countries. We present the results of FAS/partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) prevalence study and maternal characteristics in a sample of schoolchildren from a rural province of Croatia. This study involved seven elementary schools with 1,110 enrolled children attending 1st to 4th grade and their mothers. We used an active case ascertainment method with passive parental consent and Clarified IOM criteria. The investigation protocol involved maternal data collection and clinical examination of children. Out of 1,110 mothers, 917 (82.6%) answered the questionnaire. Alcohol exposure during pregnancy was admitted by 11.5%, regular drinking by 4.0% and binge drinking by 1.4% of questioned mothers. Clinical examination involved 824 (74.2%) schoolchildren and disclosed 14 (1.7%) with clinical signs of FAS and 41 (5.0%) of PFAS. The observed FAS prevalence, based on 74.2% participation rate, was 16.9, PFAS 49.7 and combined prevalence was 66.7/1,000 examined schoolchildren. This is the first FAS prevalence study based on active ascertainment among schoolchildren and pregnancy alcohol drinking analysis performed in a rural community of Croatia and Europe. High prevalence of FAS/PFAS and pregnancy alcohol consumption observed in this study revealed that FAS is serious health problem in rural regions as well as a need to develop future studies and preventive measures for pregnancy alcohol drinking and FASD.

T1  - Spirit(ed) away: Preventing foetal alcohol syndrome with motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy
A1  - Jansen Van Vuuren A.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a growing concern in South Africa. In the Western Cape, prevalence rates for FAS are the highest in the world. Not surprisingly, the Western Cape also has some of the highest levels of alcohol consumption per capita. Although FAS is primarily caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the high rate of FAS in South Africa originates from a multitude of complex factors. These factors include heritage, poverty, high levels of unemployment and low-paid menial jobs, depression, low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, increased accessibility to alcohol, lack of recreation, poor education, familial pressure, denial, cultural misconceptions and the smaller physiques of some of the women in the Western Cape. Holistic and comprehensive macro- and micro-level approaches are necessary in order to change the alcohol consumption trend that has developed over the last 300 years. No single strategy will reduce or eliminate the burden of alcohol misuse in this society. However, as the presented discussion suggests, combining the spirit of motivational interviewing (MI) with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) practice, borrowed from health psychological interventions for lifestyle-related chronic health conditions, holds promise for reducing the prevalence of FAS within Western Cape communities. These individual-based approaches have yet to be employed in South Africa despite the wealth of evidence that demonstrates their potential in targeting high-risk groups and reducing per capita alcohol consumption. © SAAFP.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol has consistently been associated with adverse effects on neurodevelopment, which is collectively called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Increasing evidence suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol increases the risk of developing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like behavior in human. In this study, we investigated the behavioral effects of prenatal exposure to EtOH in offspring mice and rats focusing on hyperactivity and impulsivity. We also examined changes in dopamine transporter and MeCP2 expression, which may underlie as a key neurobiological and epigenetic determinant in FASD and hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive behaviors. Mouse or rat offspring born from dam exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (EtOH group) showed hyper locomotive activity, attention deficit and impulsivity. EtOH group also showed increased dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter level compared to control group in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Prenatal exposure to EtOH also significantly decreased the expression of MeCP2 in both prefrontal cortex and striatum. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to EtOH induces hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive behaviors in rodent offspring that might be related to global epigenetic changes as well as aberration in catecholamine neurotransmitter transporter system. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Objectives To examine alcohol-use disorders in pregnant women and the extent of under-reporting. Design Population-based cohort study. Setting Western Australia. Population Women with a birth recorded on the Western Australian Midwives Notification System (1985-2006). Methods Mothers with an International Classification of Diseases 9/10 alcohol-related diagnosis, indicating heavy alcohol consumption, recorded on population-based health datasets (non-Aboriginal n = 5839; Aboriginal n = 2583) were identified through the Western Australian data-linkage system. This 'exposed' cohort was frequency matched (on maternal age, year of birth of offspring, Aboriginal status) with comparison mothers without an alcohol-related diagnosis (non-Aboriginal n = 33 979; Aboriginal n = 8005). Main outcome measures Trends in maternal alcohol diagnoses in relation to pregnancy for non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal women. The proportion of children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) who had a mother with an alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy. Results The proportion of Aboriginal mothers in Western Australia with an alcohol diagnosis (23.1%) is ten times greater than for non-Aboriginal mothers (2.3%). There has been a six-fold increase in the percentage of non-Aboriginal births with a maternal alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy and a 100-fold increase for Aboriginal births. Around 70% of the mothers of children diagnosed with FAS did not have an alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy and 18% of the mothers had no record of an alcohol diagnosis. Conclusions Maternal alcohol exposure during pregnancy is significantly under-ascertained. Given the severe risks to the fetus from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, assessment and recording of alcohol use should be routinely undertaken in maternity and other health settings. © 2013 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology © 2013 RCOG.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol leads to widespread cognitive deficits, including problems with attention and response inhibition. This study examined blood oxygen level-dependent response in children with and without histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during a task of response inhibition consisting of cued and noncued trials. Methods: Children and adolescents (ages 8 to 18 years) with (alcohol-exposed [AE] = 20) and without (control [CON] = 15) histories of heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a go/no-go task. Unbeknownst to subjects, a predictive cue preceded the no-go stimulus in 87% of trials. Results: Groups were matched on demographic variables and did not differ on most measures of task performance. However, following cued stimuli, the AE group demonstrated a lower hit rate to go stimuli and more conservative response bias than the CON group. AE participants demonstrated more activation during no-go trials (inhibition) relative to go trials in the left precuneus, cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate, and right medial frontal gyrus. During cue-dependent response inhibition, the AE group demonstrated less activation in the left precentral and postcentral gyrus compared to the CON group. Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies of response inhibition, the AE group demonstrated greater frontal and parietal activation when attempting to inhibit prepotent responses than the CON group, despite similar rates of commission errors. This study further demonstrated that the AE group had impaired behavioral performance on cued trials and demonstrated less activation in precentral and postcentral gyri relative to the CON group on these trials. This investigation provides evidence of impaired behavioral and neural processing of sequential information in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, which can help improve inhibition in typical populations. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objectives This study compares the behavioral profile of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) who were diagnosed using the Canadian Guidelines with children with prenatal alcohol exposure who did not meet criteria for a FASD diagnosis. Methods and Procedures To accomplish this, we used caregiver and teacher questionnaires evaluating different aspects of behavior. Investigated were 170 children, 109 who received a diagnosis of FASD (Diagnosed Group) and 61 who did not (Non-Diagnosed Group). On the caregiver report, children in the Diagnosed Group had more internalizing and externalizing problems on the CBCL, more executive function difficulties on the BRIEF and more attention problems on the Conner's Rating Scale, compared to the Non-Diagnosed Group. On teacher report, children in the Diagnosed Group had more internalizing and externalizing problems on the TRF and more attention problems on the Conner's Rating Scale, compared to the Non-Diagnosed Group. For both informants, more children in the Diagnosed group had scores in the clinically elevated range. Conclusion Overall, the present results identify key caregiver and teacher-rated profiles of children with FASD diagnoses. These profiles will aid in better understanding, diagnosing and providing focused treatment approaches for children with FASD. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Objective Children with FASD display a heterogeneous profile and may have deficits in physical, behavioural, emotional, and social functioning, as the result of prenatal alcohol exposure. The major objective of the current study was to identify if a specific pattern of neuropsychological functioning exists among children prenatally exposed to alcohol who received a diagnosis, versus exposed children who did not. We compared groups on domains of intellectual functioning, memory, attention, executive functioning, motor functioning, language/communication and achievement. Methods One hundred and seventy children who were seen in the clinic between 2005 and 2009 were included in this study. Out of the total 170 children seen, 109 received an FASD diagnosis. Results We identified a specific neuropsychological profile that typifies children diagnosed with an FASD versus those exposed prenatally to alcohol, who did not receive a diagnosis. Diagnosed children displayed a neuropsychological profile characterized by weaknesses in the areas of verbal reasoning, memory, overall language functioning, math reasoning and calculation. Groups did not differ on measures of attention or executive functioning. Conclusion The information gained from these analyses, are essential for informing best practices for diagnosis and treatment. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - According to the World Health Organization, alcohol is the third most dangerous factor following smoking of tobacco and hypertension of risks impacting health of the population. 50 % of men and 10 % of women suffer from diseases caused by alcohol drinking. Chronic consumption of alcohol damages the nervous system, causes adverse changes in the circulatory system and intestine, increases the risk of cancers. Comparing the impact of alcohol on the health of women and men, in case of women, even similar levels of consumption cause stronger action. Alcohol is the cause of endocrine diseases and among others- reduces fertility. It is the risk factor of premature deliveries, abortions, and placenta- associated pathologies. Disorders of children with prenatal exposure to alcohol are described as fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorders and alcohol related birth defects. It is recommended to impose a total ban on alcohol consumption by pregnant women. Moreover one should emphasize that the minimum safe dose of alcohol for the foetus cannot be specified. In order to resolve alcohol drinking problems a cooperation of representatives of many professions such as: doctors, psychologists, educators and employees of care facilities is necessary. It is also obligatory to obtain support and assistance from the nearest surroundings of the patient.

T1  - Powers and faden's theory of social justice applied to the problem of foetal alcohol syndrome in South Africa
A1  - Horn L.
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - South Africa has the highest rate of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the world. The problem of alcohol abuse in pregnancy has very deep historical roots that are intertwined with the injustices of both apartheid and pre-apartheid colonialism. Much of the research that is being done in these communities is focused on identifying the epidemiological variables associated with these patterns of alcohol abuse. The underlying reasons as to why these patterns continue seem to remain largely obscured from view. In this article, I apply the theory proposed by Powers and Faden of social justice as a 'moral foundation for public health and health policy' to the problem of FAS in South Africa. The objective of this application is two-fold: first, to critically explore the additional insights and alternative perspectives to the problem of FAS that this approach may provide and second, to assess the utility of the theory when applied directly to a specific public health problem. I conclude by noting that although this approach could result in the kind of 'public health scope creep' that has been criticized by various authors, it does provide fresh insights to the problem of FAS in South Africa. © 2013 The Author.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable, biomarkers of alcohol use are sometimes necessary to accurately determine fetal risk. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG), a direct metabolite of ethanol, has been detected in the meconium of infants born to mothers who consumed excessive alcohol during pregnancy. It is still unknown whether EtG detected in meconium originated from maternal hepatic glucuronidation of ethanol followed by subsequent placental transfer. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if EtG crosses the human placenta. Methods: The transfer of EtG was measured using the ex vivo dual perfusion of an isolated human placental lobule. EtG (1 mug/mL) was added to the maternal circulation and samples were taken throughout the 1 h pre-experimental and 3 h experimental phases for measurement of EtG and markers of placental viability. Results: After 3 h, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 0.29 +/- 0.02 and net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring. Triplicate averages of EtG concentrations in perfused placental lobules ranged from 140 to 414 ng/g tissue. Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all perfusions. Discussion: The data show that EtG crosses the human placenta and primarily represents maternal exposure to alcohol. Conclusions: This information can help with the development of more thorough biomarker screens for alcohol use during pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) results in a broad array of neurobehavioral deficits. Recent research has focused on identification of a neurobehavioral profile or profiles that will improve the identification of children affected by AE. This study aimed to build on our preliminary neurobehavioral profile to improve classification accuracy and test the specificity of the resulting profile in an alternate clinical group. Methods: A standardized neuropsychological test battery was administered to 3 groups of children: subjects with AE (n = 209), typically developing controls (CON, n = 185), and subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n = 74). We assessed a large sample from 6 sites in the United States and South Africa, using standardized methodology. Data were analyzed using 3 latent profile analyses including (i) subjects with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and controls, (ii) subjects with AE without FAS and controls, and (iii) subjects with AE (with or without FAS) and subjects with ADHD. Results: Classification accuracy was moderate but significant across the 3 analyses. In analysis 1, overall classification accuracy was 76.1% (77.2% FAS, 75.7% CON). In the second analysis, overall classification accuracy was 71.5% (70.1% AE/non-FAS, 72.4% CON). In the third analysis, overall classification accuracy was 73.9% (59.8% AE, 75.7% ADHD). Subjects that were misclassified were examined for systematic differences from those that were correctly classified. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the neuropsychological effects of AE are clinically meaningful and can be used to accurately distinguish alcohol-affected children from both typically developing children and children with ADHD. Further, in combination with other recent studies, these data suggest that approximately 70% of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure are neurobehaviorally affected, while the remaining 30% are spared these often-devastating consequences, at least those in the domains under study. Refining the neurobehavioral profile will allow improved identification and treatment development for children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objective: Classic facial characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) are shortened palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, and thin upper vermillion. We aim to help pediatricians detect facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum, especially among nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) individuals without classic facial characteristics. Methods: Of 192 Cape Coloured children recruited, 69 were born to women who reported abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy. According to multifaceted criteria, the remainder were allocated clinically to the FAS (n = 22), partial FAS (n = 26) or nonsyndromal HE (n = 75) categories. We used dense surface modeling and signature analyses of 3-dimensional facial photographs to determine agreement between clinical categorization and classifications induced from face shape alone, to visualize facial differences, and to consider predictive links between face shape and neurobehavior. Results: Face classification achieved significant agreement with clinical categories for discrimination of nonexposed from FAS alone (face: 0.97-1.00; profile: 0.92) or with the addition of partial FAS (face: 0.90; profile: 0.92). Visualizations of face signatures delineated dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum and in half of the nonsyndromal HE category face signature graphs detected facial characteristics consistent with prenatal alcohol exposure. This subgroup performed less well on IQ and learning tests than did nonsyndromal subjects without classic facial characteristics. Conclusions: Heat maps and morphing visualizations of face signatures may help clinicians detect facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum. Face signature graphs show potential for identifying nonsyndromal heavily exposed children who lack the classic facial phenotype but have cognitive impairment.

N2  - Genetic factors are involved in variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which is also observed among various inbred mouse strains. The CD1 mouse strain is often used in toxicological and genetic experiments. However, there is little literature using this strain to study long-term neurologic abnormalities of FASD. In the present study, we addressed the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on neurological alterations in adult CD1 mice. The female CD1 mice received exposure to ethanol solution (10 vol%) starting from 2 weeks before mating up to pups born (postnatal day 1). At 24 weeks after the birth, the prenatal ethanol-exposed mice and control mice showed no difference in spatial learning and memory performance in a Morris water maze. Consistently, pathological changes, such as increased neuronal apoptosis, decreased synaptic protein synaptophysin expression, synaptic loss and reactive astrogliosis, were not observed in the hippocampus of mice prenatally exposed to ethanol. These results suggest that CD1 mice are highly resistant to prenatal alcohol exposure and may serve as genetic modification models of FASD. Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy remains a common occurrence and is associated with a multitude of adverse birth and long-term outcomes. Binge drinking in particular is shown to be particularly harmful to the developing fetus. Effects include full fetal alcohol syndrome, with characteristic facial dysmorphology, growth restriction, and developmental to delays. Exposed children may also have partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related birth defects, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. These effects are preventable, and efforts must begin with accurate identification of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. Several screening tools have been developed and validated for use in prenatal care settings, and the most recently proposed brief and easy to use T-ACER3 has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in both identifying risk drinking during pregnancy and predicting long-term neurobehavioral outcomes in exposed children. Once identified, effective interventions are available for use with pregnant women consuming alcohol. Brief interventions, which can be delivered by a health professional and involve motivational interviewing, have been demonstrated to significantly reduce alcohol consumption during pregnancy. These approaches, recommended by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG), help move patients toward increased readiness to positively change their drinking behavior. Ultimately, all prenatal care providers should routinely screen all patients for alcohol use using validated tools, and where appropriate, should offer intervention. © 2013, Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.

N2  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading cause of preventable intellectual disabilities in the United States and a significant public health issue. Objectives The purpose of this study is to evaluate the knowledge and screening practices of pre-clinical medical students and clinical providers on FAS, FASD, and alcohol consumption. Methods A short survey sent to medical students and residents on the campus of a large medical school and university hospital. Results On the survey of clinical providers, 38% of respondents stated they always survey pregnant women about their alcohol consumption, 34% stated they always screen patients planning to get pregnant, and 9% screen women of childbearing age. There were a significant percentage of providers who never screen women. When questioned regarding safe amounts of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, 69% of preclinical medical students and 67% of clinical providers stated there is no safe amount of alcohol consumption. Clinical providers were much more likely to correctly select the facial features necessary for the diagnosis (p-value < 0.01). Conclusions Significant differences exist in the knowledge and screening practices of these different healthcare providers and trainees. Future interventions should seek to improve knowledge on FAS, FASD, and alcohol consumption, in order for practitioners to be more consistent with national guidelines and the Surgeon General recommendations. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - The characteristics of fetal acohol spectrum disorders (FASD) constitute a specific facial phenotype, growth failure and neurodevelopmental defects. Reported FASD prevalences vary widely from 0.08 per 1,000 up to 68.0-89.2 per 1,000. We aimed to evaluate to which extent children referred with a suspicion of FASD, indeed have FASD. We included all 27 children referred to our genetic department with a suspicion of FASD between 2005 and 2010. Nineteen children (70.3%) were of non-Dutch ancestry, and 24 (88.9%) had been adopted. We used both the 4-Digit Code and the Revised Institute of Medicine criteria. More than half of the children did not meet either criteria for the diagnosis of FASD. Of note, after evaluation 8/27 children appeared not to have confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure. Two children referred for suspicion of FASD (neither of which were exposed to alcohol or met the criteria for FASD) had a pathogenic microstructural chromosomal rearrangement (del16p11.2 of 542KB and dup1q44 of 915KB). In 22/24 children (91.7%) there were other factors that may have affected their intellectual abilities, such as familial intellectual disability and social deprivation. We recommend a critical approach towards the diagnosis FASD, and to investigate all patients suspected to have FASD for other causative factors including genetic abnormalities. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can have serious and permanent adverse effects. The developing brain is the most vulnerable organ to the insults of prenatal alcohol exposure. A behavioral phenotype of prenatal alcohol exposure including conduct disorders is also described. This study on a sample of Brazilian adolescents convicted for criminal behavior aimed to evaluate possible clinical features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). These were compared to a control group of school adolescents, as well as tested for other environmental risk factors for antisocial behavior. A sample of 262 institutionalized male adolescents due to criminal behavior and 154 male students aged between 13 and 21 years comprised the study population. Maternal use of alcohol was admitted by 48.8% of the mothers of institutionalized adolescents and by 39.9% of the school students. In this sample of adolescents we could not identify individual cases with a clear diagnosis of FAS, but signs suggestive of FASD were more common in the institutionalized adolescents. Social factors like domestic and family violence were frequent in the risk group, this also being associated to maternal drinking during pregnancy. The inference is that in our sample, criminal behavior is more related to complex interactions between environmental and social issues including prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure leads to widespread cognitive deficits, including problems with spatial working memory (SWM). Neuroimaging studies report structural and functional abnormalities in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), but interpretations may be complicated by the co-occurrence of a family history of alcoholism. Since this history is also linked to cognitive deficits and brain abnormalities, it is difficult to determine the extent to which deficits are unique to prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Age-matched subjects selected from 2 neuroimaging studies underwent functional imaging while engaging in a task assessing memory for spatial locations relative to a vigilance condition assessing attention. Pairwise comparisons were made for the following 3 groups: children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 18); those with no prenatal alcohol exposure, but a confirmed family history of alcoholism (FHP, n = 18); and nonexposed, family history negative controls (CON, n = 17). Results: Relative to CON and FHP, the ALC group showed increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left middle and superior frontal gyri for the SWM condition relative to the vigilance condition (SWM contrast). Additionally, the ALC group showed unique BOLD response increases in the left lingual gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus relative to CON, and left cuneus and precuneus relative to FHP. Both ALC and FHP showed greater activation compared to CON in the lentiform nucleus and insular region. Conclusions: These results confirm previous studies suggesting SWM deficits in FASD. Differences between the ALC group and the CON and FHP groups suggest the left middle and superior frontal region may be specifically affected in alcohol-exposed children. Conversely, differences from the CON group in the lentiform nucleus and insular region for the ALC and FHP groups may indicate this region is associated with family history of alcoholism rather than specifically with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol affects 1 in 100 births in the United States resulting in neurodevelopmental and learning abnormalities. Development of the nervous system, including myelination and differentiation, are dependent on soluble and membrane bound receptors. Alterations in these may underlie abnormal development due to in-utero alcohol exposure. Prenatal therapy with neuropeptides (NAP + SAL) prevents some of the developmental and behavioral abnormalities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of alcohol and NAP + SAL in cellular signaling pathways. STUDY DESIGN: We used the well characterized Webster mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnancy was identified by vaginal plug and treatment with alcohol (0.03mL/kg IP), alcohol+NAP+SAL (20fxg IP) or control (saline) was administered on gestational day 8. Embryos were harvested after 30 minutes, 60 minutes or 10 days. MAP kinase, SRC and STAT cell signaling pathways were studied using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Milli-pore) and normalized to total protein concentration. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with Fishers post hoc for multiple comparisons; P<.05 significant. RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol increased phosphorylation of JNK in the embryo at 30 and 60min compared with controls (both P<0.01). Pretreatment with NAP+SAL returned levels to control at 60min (Figure). Similarly alcohol increased phosphorylation ofp38 at 30min and NAP + SAL returned levels to control. These findings persisted at 10 days. No differences were found in the phosphorylation of ERK. The levels at these timepoints were undetectable for the SRC and STAT pathways. CONCLUSION: Phosphorylation of the JNK andp38 cell signaling pathways are affected by alcohol exposure in pregnancy. Targeting cell signaling pathways, such as with NAP+SAL, should have a significant impact on prevention of alcohol-induced abnormalities. (Graph Presented).

N2  - The relationship between maternal drinking during pregnancy and low birth weight and birth defects is expressed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the corresponding studies have not been conducted in Japan. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of alcohol and tobacco use by both mothers and fathers on the development of newborn babies and infants in Japan. This study was conducted in Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan, with collaboration with all municipal health centers in the city. The questionnaires were delivered to all parents present at health checkups for their four-month old infants, and replies were returned by post. The questionnaire included questions about infants at birth and at four months of age, related to development status, weight and height, and it also included questions about parents, related to age, physical condition, flushing history, medical history, smoking history, passive smoking, and drinking patterns before and after pregnancy ( drinking patterns of fathers were examined only before pregnancy ). Total number of replies was 3,689 of 30,600 subjects and 27 subjects were excluded due to multiple births. Compared with the national average, the average birth weight and height of our subjects were almost the same, and the physiques of the infants were related with the number of pregnancies and births, period of gestation and parents' height and weight. The maternal smoking rate was 18.3% (prepregnancy), 7.0% (less than 16 weeks of pregnancy) and 4.9%( more than 16 weeks of pregnancy). The corresponding rates of maternal drinking were 59.4%, 25.3% and 15.7%. Paternal drinking and smoking were not related to the development of newborn infants and babies. Maternal smoking history during pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights. Infants delivered by mothers who had drunk daily during pregnancy tended to show low birth weights, but it was not significant. However, maternal heavy drinking after 16 weeks of pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights, small heads, even after correction of parents' age and height, number of pregnancies and period of gestation, and maternal smoking history. Smoking and heavy drinking by mothers may disturb the development of infants of general population in Japan.

N2  - Background: Recent studies have shown significant white matter abnormalities in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is capable of identifying subtle microstructural abnormalities in white matter - including in the absence of gross structural anomalies. Our previous work has revealed that corpus callosum abnormalities in FASD are associated with measurable disturbances in inter-hemispheric functional connectivity. The current study extends these findings in an examination of whole-brain functional connectivity using graph-theory analysis of resting fMRI data. Methods: High resolution anatomical, 30-direction DTI, and 6-minute eyes-closed restingstate fMRI data were obtained on a Siemens Tim Trio 3T scanner from 24 children (ages 10-17) with FASD and 31 matched control subjects. All children were evaluated and diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician using the University of Washington 4-digit diagnostic system. Neurocognitive evaluations, including the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WISC-IV / WAIS-IV), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT / CVLT-C) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) were also obtained. MRI data were pre-processed with the 1000-functional-connectome protocol. fMRI data were subjected to regression against whole-brain signal, white matter, CSF, and motion. Susceptibility artifacts in the fMRI data were corrected with field maps. Anatomical data were parsed with FreeSurfer and ROIs were applied to the fMRI data. The matrix of correlations of resting fMRI signal from 60 cortical ROIs was examined with graph theory analyses. Results: Overall network efficiency was significantly lower in FASD vs. controls as evidenced by higher mean path length in FASD (p=.038) and lower global efficiency (p=.042) in FASD. There were also trend-level indications of abnormalities in localized processing including higher mean clustering coefficient (p=.066) and higher local efficiency (p=.096) in FASD. None of the four network indices was correlated with IQ, but significant correlations were observed between path length and global executive functioning on the BRIEF (r=.41, p = .048). Global efficiency and path length were also correlated to initial learning (trial 1) on the CVLT. Conclusions: The results from this study of whole-brain functional connectivity are consistent with previous studies, including our own, that suggest significant abnormities in brain networks among children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Measures of network function were found to correlate significantly with cognitive functioning including memory and executive control. Whole-brain functional connectivity measures have the potential to serve as an index of level of functional brain impairment and also to serve as measures of change - change over development and change with intervention.

N2  - Neurons containing proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptides, known to control stress axis, metabolic and immune functions, have a lower function in patients with a family history of alcoholism, raising the possibility that alcohol effects on the POMC system may transmit through generations. In this study we investigated whether prenatal ethanol alters DNA methylation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, and also whether the methylation changes in the proximal POMC promoter can be transmitted transgenerationally. The rat POMC gene contains a 5' CpG island that surrounds the POMC transcription start site. Detailed characterization of POMC DNA methylation revealed that there were fetal alcohol-induced changes in methylation that resulted in hypermethylation of proximal POMC promoter in adulthood, even though the exposure to ethanol ended at GD 21. A transgenerational study was conducted by mating male and female rats (F1) prenatally exposed to alcohol or a control diet for three generations. The proximal POMC promoter in the F1 and F2 animals was significantly hypermethylated in comparison to the control group, and the POMC gene expression level was decreased in both male and female progenies. However, in the F3 generation only male offspring of the exposed animals demonstrated a significant increase in DNA methylation level with the concomitant drop in POMC gene expression. Additionally, hypermethylated POMC gene was detected in sperm of fetal alcohol exposed F1 through F3 male germline. The germline transmission of POMC gene methylation was also correlated with altered stress axis response. Thus, our data highlight the novel possibility that epigenetic changes contribute to the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on POMC gene expression, as well as, the perpetuation of abnormal POMC neuronal functions through subsequent generations via the male, possibly through Y-chromosome. The results also shed light on the sexdependent difference in the genetic risk of alcohol dependence.

N2  - Purpose : Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders refers to a constellation of physical, psychological and emotional deficits that affect children of mothers who used alcohol during pregnancy, the most serious of which is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, or FAS. Although, Asian countries were known to have lower prevalence of alcohol drinking and alcohol dependence, currently those among women has been increasing very fast. In Korea, the rate of past month drinking among women has been increasing from 32% to 80%(1989 - 2007). This trend was prominent especially in childbearing age group. Therefore, it was expected that there might be substantial risk of development of FASD in Korea. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of FASD in Korea. Method : We used active case ascertainment approach to raise the possibility of detecting FASD case. We visited 8 institutes where the kids with mental retardation were committed and 13 general elimentary school. In primary screening process, 307 kids were screened by height and weight. 97 Kids whose height or weight are under 10 percentile were selected for facial dysmorphologic examination in institution. In addition, in general school setting, 7,785 kids were screened, and dysmorphologic examination were performed in 231 kids. Results : Among kids in instiution 13 kids(14%) were diagnosed by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, while 40(43%) kids were found to be group with deferred diagnosed by FAS. Further among kids in general school, 40 kids(0.51%) were diagnosed by FAS according to dysmorphology core criteria by CIFASD, while 14 kids(0.18%) were diagnosed by FAS according to Canaidian diagnosis guidelines. Conclusion : In conclusion, as we used active case ascertainment approach to higher risk group and general population, we could find the relatively higher rate of FAS. In order to estimate the general prevalence of FASD, the expanded epidemiologic survey on FASD in general population and alcohol exposure in perinatal clinic are needed.

N2  - Purpose of the Study: The relationship between maternal drinking during pregnancy and low birth weight and birth defects is expressed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the corresponding studies have not been conducted in Japan. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of alcohol and tobacco use by both mothers and fathers on the development of newborn babies and infants in Japan. Method: This study was conducted in Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan, with collaboration with all municipal health centers in the city. The questionnaires were delivered to all parents present at health checkups for their four-month old infants, and replies were returned by post. The questionnaire included questions about infants at birth and at four months of age, related to development status, weight and height, and it also included questions about parents, related to age, physical condition, flushing history, medical history, smoking history, passive smoking, and drinking patterns before and after pregnancy ( drinking patterns of fathers were examined only before pregnancy ). Results: Total number of replies was 3,689 of 30,600 subjects and 27 subjects were excluded due to multiple births. Compared with the national average, the average birth weight and height of our subjects were almost the same, and the physiques of the infants were related with the number of pregnancies and births, period of gestation and parents' height and weight. The maternal smoking rate was 18.3% (prepregnancy), 7.0% (less than 16 weeks of pregnancy) and 4.9%( more than 16 weeks of pregnancy). The corresponding rates of maternal drinking were 59.4%, 25.3% and 15.7%. Paternal drinking and smoking were not related to the development of newborn infants and babies. Maternal smoking history during pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights. Infants delivered by mothers who had drunk daily during pregnancy tended to show low birth weights, but it was not significant. However, maternal heavy drinking after 16 weeks of pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights, small heads, even after correction of parents' age and height, number of pregnancies and period of gestation, and maternal smoking history. Conclusion: Smoking and heavy drinking by mothers may disturb the development of infants of general population in Japan.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the most debilitating outcome of an alcoholexposed pregnancy (AEP) associated with heavy maternal drinking; alcohol consumption at lower levels can result in a range of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). No safe amount of alcohol or time during pregnancy has been identified, including early in pregnancy when a woman may not know she is pregnant. A combination of at-risk drinking with the possibility of becoming pregnant constitutes significant risk for AEP. The risk is prevalent among Russian women and developing OBGYN clinic-based brief interventions (BI) that target both risky alcohol consumption and lack of contraception is promising for preventing FASD. Methods: This study is a two-arm, site-randomized clinical trial testing a BI designed to reduce the AEP risk among childbearing age women. Women were recruited for the study at 20 district OBGYN clinics in two locations, representing a major urban population of St. Petersburg (SPB) and a more rural population of the Nizhny Novgorod Region (NNR). Clinics were randomized to intervention or control/services as usual conditions. The intervention was based on BI guidelines (Barbor & Higgins-Biddle, 1992; Whitlock et al. 2004) and evidence-based FASD prevention interventions, Healthy Moms (Fleming et al., 2008) and Project CHOICES (Floyd et al., 2007). The dual-focused brief physician intervention (DFBPI) was designed to be deliverable by OBGYN physicians at women's clinics. The intervention consisted of two face-to-face, structured, 5-minute sessions incorporated in clinic visits scheduled approximately one month apart. Follow-up assessments were at 3, 6, and 12-months. A total of 1,914 childbearing age women were screened and women at risk for AEP,( i.e., had intercourse without effective contraception and consumed four or more drinks on any occasion or eight or more than drinks per week) were recruited for the study (n=764), including 404 women at-risk in SPB and 360 in NNR. Results: Binge drinking was prevalent among women at both study locations; NNR women reported less effective contraceptive use. Physicians incorporated the intervention into clinic visits and maintained intervention skills. Preliminary findings: Both groups reduced alcohol consumption- 68% in the intervention group and 64% in control group at 3 month follow-up. Compared to the control group, larger proportions of women in the intervention condition reported reduced alcohol consumption at 6 month (71% vs 61%) and 12 month follow up (69 vs 56%). Conclusions: Results support the feasibility of the DFBPI at OBGYN clinics in Russia.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to induce fetal brain growth deficits at different embryonic stages. We focused this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects against alcohol-induced apoptosis at midgestation using activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF)-9, a peptide (SALLRSIPA) derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor, and NAP, a peptide (NAPVSIPQ) derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein. We used an established fetal alcohol exposure mouse model. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet (ALC) group with 25 % (4.49 %, v/v) ethanol-derived calories, (2) pair-fed (PF) control group, (3) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9) group, (4) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of NAP (ALC/NAP) group, (5) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of ADNF-9 (PF/ADNF-9) group, and (6) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of NAP (PF/NAP) group. On day 15 (E15), fetal brains were collected, weighed, and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. ADNF-9 or NAP was administered daily from E7 to E15 alongside PF or ALC liquid diet exposure. Our results show that NAP and ADNF-9 significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of fetal brains. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP or ADNF-9 administration alongside alcohol exposure significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium of the cingulate cortex and ganglionic eminence. These findings may pave the path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during pregnancy stages. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Objective: In humans, antenatal alcohol exposure elicits various developmental disorders, in particular in the brain. Numerous studies focus on the deleterious effects of alcohol on neural cells. Although recent studies suggest that alcohol can affect angiogenesis in adults, the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain microvasculature remains poorly understood. Methods: We used a mouse model to investigate effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the cortical microvascular network in vivo and ex vivo and the action of alcohol, glutamate, and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) on activity, plasticity, and survival of microvessels. We used quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, calcimetry, and videomicroscopy. We characterized the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the cortical microvascular network in human controls and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (pFAS) patients at different developmental stages. Results: In mice, prenatal alcohol exposure induced a reduction of cortical vascular density, loss of the radial orientation of microvessels, and altered expression of VEGF receptors. Time-lapse experiments performed on brain slices revealed that ethanol inhibited glutamate-induced calcium mobilization in endothelial cells, affected plasticity, and promoted death of microvessels. These effects were prevented by VEGF. In humans, we evidenced a stage-dependent alteration of the vascular network in the cortices of fetuses with pFAS/FAS. Whereas no modification was observed from gestational week 20 (WG20) to WG22, the radial organization of cortical microvessels was clearly altered in pFAS/FAS patients from WG30 to WG38. Interpretation: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects cortical angiogenesis both in mice and in pFAS/FAS patients, suggesting that vascular defects contribute to alcohol-induced brain abnormalities.

N2  - Studies in rat models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders have indicated that the cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to ethanol-induced Purkinje cell loss during the third trimester-equivalent, with striking regional differences in vulnerability in which early-maturing regions in the vermis show significantly more loss than the late-maturing regions. The current study tested the hypothesis that the sheep model will show similar regional differences in fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell loss when prenatal binge ethanol exposure is restricted to the prenatal period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester and also compared the pattern of loss to that produced by exposure during the first trimester-equivalent. Pregnant Suffolk sheep were assigned to four groups: first trimester-equivalent saline control group, first trimester-equivalent ethanol group (1.75. g/kg/day), third trimester-equivalent saline control group, and third trimester-equivalent ethanol group (1.75. g/kg/day). Ethanol was administered as an intravenous infusion on 3 consecutive days followed by a 4-day ethanol-free interval, to mimic a weekend binge drinking pattern. Animals from all four groups were sacrificed and fetal brains were harvested on gestation day 133. Fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell counts were performed in an early-maturing region (lobules I-X) and a late-maturing region (lobules VIc-VII) from mid-sagittal sections of the cerebellar vermis. As predicted, the third trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure caused a significant reduction in the fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell volume density and Purkinje cell number in the early-maturing region, but not in the late-maturing region. In contrast, the first trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure resulted in significant reductions in both the early and late-maturing regions. These data confirmed that the previous findings in rat models that third trimester-equivalent prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in regionally-specific Purkinje cell loss in the early-maturing region of the vermis, and further demonstrated that first trimester ethanol exposure caused more generalized fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, independent of the cerebellar vermal region. These findings support the idea that prenatal ethanol exposure in the first trimester interferes with the genesis of Purkinje cells in an unselective manner, whereas exposure during the third trimester selectively kills post-mitotic Purkinje cells in specific vermal regions during a vulnerable period of differentiation and synaptogenesis. © 2012.

N2  - Background Alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) falls under the umbrella of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), but individuals do not demonstrate the facial characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), making diagnosis difficult. While attentional problems in ARND are similar to those found in attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the underlying impairment in attention pathways may be different. Methods Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a working memory (1-back) task of 63 children, 10 to 14 years old, diagnosed with ARND and ADHD, as well as typically developing (TD) controls, was conducted at 3 T. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were also acquired. Results Activations were observed in posterior parietal and occipital regions in the TD group and in dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal regions in the ARND group, whereas the ADHD group activated only dorsolateral prefrontal regions, during the working memory component of the task (1-back minus 0-back contrast). The increases in frontal and parietal activity were significantly greater in the ARND group compared to the other groups. This increased activity was associated with reduced accuracy and increased response time variability, suggesting that ARND subjects exert greater effort to manage short-term memory load. Significantly greater intra-subject variability, demonstrated by fMRI region-of-interest analysis, in the ADHD and ARND groups compared to the TD group suggests that momentto- moment lapses in attention contributed to their poorer task performance. Differences in functional activity in ARND subjects with and without a diagnosis of ADHD resulted primarily from reduced activation by the ARND/ADHD + group during the 0-back task. In contrast, children with ADHD alone clearly showed reduced activations during the 1-back task. DTI analysis revealed that the TD group had significantly higher total tract volume and number of fibers than the ARND group. These measures were negatively correlated with errors on the 1-back task, suggesting a link between white matter integrity and task performance. Conclusions fMRI activations suggest that the similar behavior of children with ARND and ADHD on a spatial working memory task is the result of different cognitive events. The nature of ADHD in children with ARND appears to differ from that of children with ADHD alone. © 2012 Malisza et al.

N2  - Background: A derived peptide from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) has been shown to be neuroprotective in the fetal alcohol exposure model. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 against alcohol-induced apoptosis using TUNEL staining. We further characterize in this study the proteomic architecture underlying the role of ADNF-9 against ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Methods. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic days 7-13 (E7-E13) to a 25% ethanol-derived calorie [25% EDC, Alcohol (ALC)] diet, a 25% EDC diet simultaneously administered i.p. ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9), or a pair-fed (PF) liquid diet. At E13, fetal brains were collected from 5 dams from each group, weighed, and frozen for LC-MS/MS procedure. Other fetal brains were fixed for TUNEL staining. Results: Administration of ADNF-9 prevented alcohol-induced reduction in fetal brain weight and alcohol-induced increases in cell death. Moreover, individual fetal brains were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Statistical differences in the amounts of proteins between the ALC and ALC/ADNF-9 groups resulted in a distinct data-clustering. Significant upregulation of several important proteins involved in brain development were found in the ALC/ADNF-9 group as compared to the ALC group. Conclusion: These findings provide information on potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 in the fetal alcohol exposure model. © 2011 Sari et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: Studies of the adverse neurobehavioral effects of maternal alcohol consumption on the fetus have been largely confined to the postnatal period, after exposure to alcohol has finished. This study explored the brain function of the fetus, at the time of exposure to alcohol, to examine its effect on information processing and stability of performance. Methods: Five groups of fetuses, defined by maternal alcohol consumption patterns, were examined: control (no alcohol); moderate (5 to 10 units/wk either drunk evenly across the week or as a binge, in 2 to 3 days); heavy (20+ units/wk drunk evenly or as a binge). Fetal habituation performance was examined on 3 occasions, separated by 7 days, beginning at 35 weeks of gestation. The number of trials required to habituate on each test session and the difference in performance across test sessions were recorded. Results: Fetuses exposed to heavy binge drinking required significantly more trials to habituate and exhibited a greater variability in performance across all test sessions than the other groups. Maternal drinking, either heavily but evenly or moderately as a binge, resulted in poorer habituation, and moderate binge drinking resulted in greater variability compared with no, or even, drinking. Conclusions: Decreased information processing, reflected by poorer habituation, and increased variability in performance may reflect the initial manifestations of structural damage caused by alcohol to the brain. These results will lead to a greater understanding of the effects of alcohol on the fetus's brain, enable the antenatal identification of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and lead to the early implementation of better management strategies. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Introduction: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has been identified as significant medical and public health problem. Many studies have reported morphologic characteristics and long-term disabilities. However neurodevelopment of early infancy has been rarely described. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Cheil General Hospital Mother Risk Program. In total 236 pregnant women participated in the research and filled out TWEAK questionnaire. After delivery and 12 months postpartum, offspring5 were examined and mothers were interviewed. Meconium was collected to measure fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) in their offspring5. 106 babies being over 10 months of age were performed the physically examined and Bayley scales of infant and Toddler Development III (BSID-III) were performed. We compared the growth (height, weight, and head circumference), morphological characteristics (palpebral fissure length and philtrum grade) and BSID-III results between maternal alcohol drinking group and non-drinking group. Results: The overall rate of alcohol drinking more than once during pregnancy was 55% (66/120). In maternal alcohol drinking group, TWEAK positive rate was 38% (25/66) and FAEE positive rate was 24% (8/33). One child was diagnosed as foetal alcohol syndrome. For the growth, children in the maternal alcohol drinking group showed less growth rate, shorter palpebral fissure length, higher philtrum grade and lower BSID-III score than in the nondrinking group however statistical difference was not significant. Conclusion: Offspring of women drinking alcohol had tendency of delayed neurodevelopment but that was not prominent in early infancy. Development test alone could not be a diagnostic tool for FASD without distinctive FAS morphology.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The indications of brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in fetal alcohol syndrome are not clearly defined, even though the condition is recognized as one of the most common causes of mental retardation. This article reports a case of a 9-year-old adopted girl with developmental delay, mildly dysmorphic facial features, and behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. Extensive investigations including genetic studies and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormalities, and a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome was considered since official diagnostic criteria were met. A brain SPECT was requested and showed severely decreased tracer activity in the thalami, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes on both sides, the overall findings being consistent with the established diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. With increasing availability of functional brain imaging, the study indications and possible ethical implications in suspected prenatal alcohol exposure or even before adoption need further consideration. In this patient, SPECT was the only test to yield positive results. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - Objective: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these alterations. Study Design: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after 6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P <.05 considered significant. Results: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9; range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P <.003), similar to the controls. Alcohol exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (P <.003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1beta were decreased 6 hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-, and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of the groups. Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Background: Observational studies have generated conflicting evidence on the effects of moderate maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy on offspring cognition mainly reflecting problems of confounding. Among mothers who drink during pregnancy fetal alcohol exposure is influenced not only by mother's intake but also by genetic variants carried by both the mother and the fetus. Associations between children's cognitive function and both maternal and child genotype at these loci can shed light on the effects of maternal alcohol consumption on offspring cognitive development. Methods: We used a large population based study of women recruited during pregnancy to determine whether genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes in this cohort of women and their children were related to the child's cognitive score (measured by the Weschler Intelligence Scale) at age 8. Findings: We found that four genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes in 4167 children were strongly related to lower IQ at age 8, as was a risk allele score based on these 4 variants. This effect was only seen amongst the offspring of mothers who were moderate drinkers (1-6 units alcohol per week during pregnancy (per allele effect estimates were -1.80 (95% CI = -2.63 to -0.97) p = 0.00002, with no effect among children whose mothers abstained during pregnancy (0.16 (95%CI = -1.05 to 1.36) p = 0.80), p-value for interaction = 0.009). A further genetic variant associated with alcohol metabolism in mothers was associated with their child's IQ, but again only among mothers who drank during pregnancy. © 2012 Lewis et al.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Objective: To determine to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta. Methods: Placentae (n=4) from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto were taken to the on-site perfusion laboratory. After cannulation and establishment of dual circulation, 1 mcg/mL EtG was added to the maternal reservoir and samples were taken throughout the 3h experiment. Measurements of placental viability were oxygen transfer, pH, glucose consumption, hCG production, fetal reservoir volume, and fetal arterial inflow pressure. EtG was analyzed in perfusate samples and placental tissue by GC-MS after solid phase extraction. Results: After 3h, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 0.30 +/- 0.02 and net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring. Triplicate averages of EtG concentrations in perfused placental lobules ranged from 140-414 ng/g. Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all perfusions. Conclusions: EtG appears to cross the human placenta and, hence, to represent both maternal and fetal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) are both validated biomarkers of chronic excessive alcohol consumption in hair. One of the most promising clinical applications of alcohol hair analysis is to identify infants as risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) by assessing maternal ethanol consumption; however, studies on FAEE and EtG hair analysis to determine alcohol abuse have been primarily conducted in male populations. Previous studies have indicated that the use of ethanol containing hair-care products may elevate FAEE concentrations in hair, providing a potential source of bias in the use of this biomarker in female populations. This study examines individuals undergoing hair analysis under suspicion of chronic alcohol abuse in child safety investigations. METHODS: A total of 207 hair specimens were analyzed for both FAEE and EtG, approximately 70% of all samples were from female donors. Onehundred fifty-eight samples were blindly assessed for both biomarkers; n = 49 additional samples were analyzed for EtG following positive FAEE analysis. Cut-off values of 0.50 ng/mg-FAEE and 25 pg/mg-EtG were applied to determine chronic excessive alcohol consumption. Hair samples were pre-washed to remove external contamination and analyzed for FAEE and EtG by GC-MS using deuterated internal standards. RESULTS: A higher rate of correspondence was found between FAEE and EtG levels amongst male (71%) over female (28%) subjects. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a gender bias exists making determination of chronic excessive alcohol use challenging in female subjects. The source of this bias is likely cosmetic hair treatments; with ethanol-containing hair products producing false-positive FAEE findings and hair bleaching/colouring possibly producing falsenegative EtG results contributing to a greater discordance amongst samples of female origin.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Although receiving services for developmental disabilities is a strong protective factor against negative outcomes in FASD, there is little research on service utilization patterns among individuals with FASD. The goal of the current study was to examine rates of service utilization among children with FASD and those with confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) without an FASD diagnosis. Service utilization patterns were compared across diagnostic group, diagnostic assessment before age six vs. after age six, and residential location (urban vs. rural). Methods: Caregivers of 46 children with FASD and 26 with PAE were interviewed using the Services for Children and Adolescents Parent Interview (SCAPI). The SCAPI collects information about child medication, individual child therapy, parent/family therapy, education services, parenting classes/groups, and parent medication. Questions about respite and early intervention were added. Results: The most frequently used services among both diagnostic groups were education services, child medication, child therapy, and parenting classes. The groups differed in access to educational support (accessed more by FASD) and parenting classes/groups (accessed more by PAE). Children assessed before age 6 had better service access than those diagnosed later in areas of early intervention, parent/family therapy, and parent medication whereas a greater proportion of those diagnosed after age 6 accessed respite. Service access did not differ between urban and rural participants. Conclusions: An FASD diagnosis instead of just confirmed PAE does not generally seem to increase overall rates of service utilization. Furthermore, geographic location has little effect on service utilization. However, being diagnosed before age six appears to be associated with better service access.

N2  - Objectives: As part of population-based prevalence study of FASD in the Lazio Province of Italy, researchers conducted in-depth maternal interviews with mothers of all cohort subjects (n=976). The objective was to examine and better define the maternal risk factors of the mothers who produce children with an FASD. Materials & Methods: Lazio contains the city of Rome and the study area is characterized by small and medium sized towns and rural areas. The study consisted of two waves of dysmorphology screening, child testing, and interviews of mothers all with affected children and controls from first grade classes and their mothers. Results: Analysis of the maternal demographic and drinking characteristics of mothers of children with FASD, mothers of randomly-selected controls, and community mothers of other first grade children provided many statistically significant results including height and body mass index (BMI) differences, with mothers of the FASD children being the shortest (F = 5.95, p =.003), and having the highest BMI (F = 3.45, p = .032). Mothers of FASD children report the highest lifetime alcohol consumption (X2 = 7.85, p = .020), as well as more drinks consumed per month (F = 10.72, p = .000), and in the past week (F = 8.27, p = .000) at the time of interview. In addition, total drinks consumed per week three months before pregnancy is significantly higher for mothers of children with FASD (F = 5.03, p = .007), as is the percentage of that group who report consuming three drinks or more per occasion during pregnancy (e.g., binge drinking; X2 = 5.70, p = .058). Correlations illustrate the importance of maternal demographic (e.g., mother's occupation and monthly income) and other drinking variables (e.g., variety of alcohol types consumed, total number drinks consumed per week three months before pregnancy, binge drinking), as they correlate significantly with child physical traits that are key to FASD diagnoses, In addition, paternal and family variables are examined, including reported alcohol problems in the child's family and father's legal problems, both of which differ significantly by group (FASD, Control, and Community; X2 = 11.74, p = .003 and X2 = 8.03, p = .018, respectively), with the greatest problems in the FASD group. Conclusion: Maternal risk factors for FASD in Italy have been better defined by this study, and the results may be relevant to other European countries.

N2  - Introduction: Ethanol consumption by pregnant women can produce severe effects in the foetus and the newborn, mainly in neurological and weight-height development, and are included in the term FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder). Questionnaires are the most used screening method to detect prenatal exposure, but a previous population study questioned its reliability. The objective of this study was to compare alcohol prenatal exposure detection by questionnaire compared with biomarkers in meconium. Materials & Methods: Sixty two meconium samples from mothers who denied alcohol consumption during pregnancy by questionnaire were analysed. The objective analysis was made by determination of FAEEs (fatty acid ethyl esters) as exposure biomarkers in meconium as biological matrix. Results: In the meconium from 10 of 62 newborns from non-alcohol consuming mothers by questionnaire (16.12%) FAEE values were positive (> 2 nmol/g). Discussion: Questionnaires as a screening method during pregnancy are not a reliable tool. It is necessary to identify prenatal exposure to alcohol as soon as possible by biomarkers analysis in biological matrices from the newborn or the mother. The early detection will allow these patients to benefit from follow up and treatment to reach the best possible neurological development.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this systematic report was to review the literature regarding the attachment styles of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Materials & Methods: AMED, BNI, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, Pubmed Central, and Science Direct were systematically searched using various FASD (FASD, PAE , FAS, FAE) terminologies alongside the keyword of attachment. Papers were also checked manually against records. Results: The systematic searches yielded a mere eight articles and two dissertation abstracts dated from 1987 to 2009. Only two articles were found that addressed a specific FASD condition; which reported no effects upon the child's attachment. Five studies argued for an association between prenatal alcohol exposure and insecurity of attachment in offspring, one reported infrequent effects of alcohol on attachment, whereas the remaining two found no significant relationship; with one article contesting that any differences in attachment may be explained by low-quality care instead. All of the articles suffered from methodological issues including sample size, choice of measures and control of confounding variables; however the specific variable of intellectual functioning, which is commonly damaged within suffers of FASD, was not appropriately considered. Studies into attachment within children diagnosed with disorders that are frequently co-morbid with FASD, such as ADHD and ASD, may help to shed the light on the effects of FASD. Conclusions: With many children born to alcohol addicted mothers being taken into care or experiencing neglect the lack of research and high prevalence within this group of neurodevelopmental disorders, further research is required to understand attachment styles in children with FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Early diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is essential for the prevention of secondary problems. There are, however, strong indications that many children and adults with FASD go unrecognized and are untreated. In addition, some individuals with FASD are incorrectly diagnosed and receive the wrong treatment. This pilot study investigates to what degree FASD related behavior problems are present in children in foster care in The Netherlands. Materials & Methods: Approximately 270 Dutch foster parents will be approached to participate in our study. Data will be collected for children, aged 6 to 16, who have been in their current foster family for over 6 months. Foster parents will be asked to fill out a digital questionnaire including demographic and background variables and including two instruments that were developed to detect children with FASD. The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Questionnaire (FASQ) developed by Feldmann (Scheffner, 2011) includes 38 items presenting social, behavioral and emotional problems of children and adolescents indicative of FASD. The Neurobehavioural Screening Tool (NST; Nash, Koren, & Rovet, 2009) is based on ten questions from the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: Data collection is in progress. Parents are currently being approached and asked to complete the questionnaire. First results are expected in September 2012. Conclusion: Based on the high risk background of foster children, we expect that children in foster care show elevated levels of behavioral problems related to FASD, and that there is a significant relationship between these problems and the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy of the mother. An increased rate of such behavior problems will be a strong indication for the need for diagnosticians and foster care workers to focus more on FASD.

N2  - Objectives: The Russian Federation has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the world; however, little is known about the existing pool of research related to prenatal alcohol exposure, and particularly Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in this country. The objective of this study was to locate and review published and unpublished studies concerning any aspects related to FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure conducted in or using populations from the Russian Federation. Materials & Methods: A systematic literature search was performed simultaneously in the Russian Federation and Canada. The search was conducted in multiple (English and Russian) electronic bibliographic databases, using multiple combinations of the key words in both Russian and English. In addition, the search was conducted in several major libraries in Moscow. Results: In total, only 60 studies were identified and included in the current review: 48 studies were in Russian and 12 were in English. The examined studies can be categorized into the following four major groups: those that 1) assessed alcohol consumption during pregnancy; 2) examined Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and FASD prevalence in the general population, and/or foster homes and orphanages; 3) clinically examined children and adults and demonstrated the life-long polysystemic teratogenic effect of alcohol on the fetus; and 4) experimentally studied the teratogenic effect of alcohol on laboratory animals. The results of the studies are exceptionally alarming. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy varies from approximately 14% to 83% in various regions of the Russian Federation. Binge drinking is reported to occur in up to 21% of pregnancies. The prevalence of FAS in the general population was estimated in only one study, which reported the prevalence to be as 18-19 per 1,000 live births. This figure is approximately 20 times higher than that reported for the general population of Canada. The prevalence of FAS in orphanages for children with special needs was reported extremely high - ranging from about 427 to 680 per 1,000. Conclusion: Given the alarming prevalence rates of prenatal alcohol exposure and FASD, very little is being done in terms of research in this area within the Russian Federation. An increase in attention by the research community is urgently needed in order to improve the overall awareness of the negative consequences of consuming alcohol while pregnant, as well as the initiation of preventive measures in this country.

N2  - Objectives: Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a public health priority. FASD prevention programs can be broadly categorized into universal, selective and indicated based upon the breadth of the target population, the risk of having children with FASD, and the cost-benefit ratio of committing resources. Establishing and strengthening policies and plans for FASD prevention require an informed consideration of what is known to be effective. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the scientific literature on the effectiveness of FASD prevention on prenatal alcohol use- and FASD-related outcomes. Materials & Methods: Searches in biomedical electronic databases and the grey literature were conducted for the period from 1970 to February 2012 to identify studies (i.e., randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), observational analytical cohort studies, and uncontrolled trials) assessing universal, selective, and indicated prevention interventions targeting the broad community, pregnant women, women of childbearing age, women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) or of having a child with FASD. Results: From 3,455 references retrieved, 59 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review (Universal = 19, Selective = 30; Indicated = 10). The best scientific evidence on the effectiveness of universal FASD prevention is derived from two studies of moderate-to-weak methodological quality that evaluated a multimedia education program targeting youth in the community. Multimedia and macro-level education programs produced a statistically significant improvement in the level of knowledge regarding FASD and the effects of alcohol drinking during pregnancy. Studies assessing universal interventions such as alcohol-related warning messages, health educational activities and alcohol bans were of poor quality; and, overall, did not show that these interventions lead to significant modifications in knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of risks associated with drinking during pregnancy. Compared to universal preventive interventions, the following selective preventive interventions have a better scientific evidence base (overall strong and moderate quality) for their effectiveness: motivational interviewing, counselling activities and health education programs for women of childbearing age who consume alcohol, pregnant women, and women at risk of AEP. The scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of indicated approaches is weak and inconclusive. Conclusion: The scientific base to support the effectiveness of universal and indicated approaches for prevention of FASD is limited. Moderate evidence for selective prevention activities such as counselling, motivational interviewing and health education for pregnant women and women at risk of AEP is encouraging.

N2  - Objective: For children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) preterm birth (PTB) is frequently reported. Preterm birth may cause a variety of motor and cognitive deficits in the premature infant. The effect of preterm birth on the motor cognitive outcome in patients with FAS is unknown. Matierals & Methods: We assessed the mental and motor development of 48 children with PTB and 30 children with FAS using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II). Groups were matched for age (PTB: M = 25 months, SD = 3 months; FAS: M = 27 months, SD = 6 months). Of the children with PTB, 31 had bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or intracranial hemorrhage, 17 had no birth complications. Of the FAS children, 12 had PTB (all without birth complications). Results: In the BSID-II, PTB children without birth complications had a mean mental (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) that were close to normal (MDI = 98, PDI = 92). PTB children with birth complications had a mean MDI of 85 and a mean PDI of 81. Children with FAS had a mean MDI of 79 and a mean PDI of 80. MDI was higher in FAS children with PTB compared to FAS children without PTB (81 vs. 77). Conclusions: PTB, although frequently in FAS, seems not to contribute to the mental or motor development deficits in children with FAS. Deficits are caused predominantly by the prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Moreover, in children with FAS, PTB without complications seems to moderate the effects of PAE.

N2  - Background: Alcoholism during pregnancy is one of the most common factors in western societies causing persisting congenital and multiple physical as well as neurological impairments. Finding the diagnosis at first sight puts medical professionals into a demanding situation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect patients' developmental characteristics with the main focus on the necessity of the diagnosis itself. Patients: 125 young patients, whose diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made at the Muenster University Hospital, were followed up. Materials & Methods: Biographic details such as living conditions, health, developmental problems and educational career were gathered using a structured interview. The diagnosis itself and the impact of this on the patients were also explored. Results: Patients displayed characteristics of a less mature trait of character. The majority were looked after by foster parents. High rates of social and developmental problems could be found. The diagnosis was identified as a protective factor, with significantly better outcomes for patients being diagnosed in early childhood. A diagnosis established later in life was particularly helpful for the families and caregivers. Feelings of failure and self-blame could be diminished. Conclusions: The early detection of affected children has to be improved as receiving the correct diagnosis, despite the persistent impairments, is of major benefit for both patients and their families.

N2  - Objectives: According to a study at the Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca of Murcia, only 29% of women don't drink any alcohol in the preconception period (the most critical to the fetus). The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has announced that a low level consumption of alcohol (1 or 2 units once or twice a week) has not yet been found to be harmful to women or their babies (http://www.rcog.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1996). However, the Spanish Society of Obstetrics and Ginecology (SEGO), in cooperation with the Association of Brewers of Spain, has launched, since 2009, the educational campaign "A pregnancy without", which aims to raise awareness among pregnant women about the incompatibility of alcohol consumption during the pregnancy period, with the slogan "Because he drinks what you drink". The campaign is proposed to beer drinkers; who are pregnant; plan to become pregnant or breastfeeding, choose non-alcoholic variety. Materials & Methods: During the campaign messages are disseminated through information materials, supervised by the Spanish Ministry of Health, gynecologists across the country providing useful information about alcohol-free beer as an alternative to the traditional one and how could integrated into the habits of the pregnant woman. Additionally, the campaign also includes the dissemination of information brochure that is aimed at pregnant women that has collected various recommendations to help them follow a complete and balanced diet. In order to increase the dispread of messages among pregnant women, and society in general, there was a wide broadcasting of campaign messages in the media. Results: All members of SEGO (with 6,300 national partners) have received some information and materials on the properties of non-alcoholic beer as an alternative to traditional beer during pregnancy, emphasizing the dangers of drinking in this period. Also were distributed over 500,000 information brochure among pregnant women and women who want to be. Conclusion: This campaign is an example of good practice in prevention and public health and scientific collaboration between an association whose objective is to ensure the health and individual sectors committed to preventing cases of inadequate intake of beer. Thanks to it has been possible to achieve satisfactory results in relation to the spread, helped by the information campaign in the media where the SEGO warned of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Objectives: The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical, mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The measurement of ethylglucuronide (EtG) in alternative biological matrices, including neonatal and maternal hair, neonatal meconium, and maternal nails is receiving increasing interest for the accurate evaluation of the utero exposure to alcohol. Aims: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between EtG in maternal hair and nails with EtG in neonatal meconium to further explore the suitability of these biomarkers in disclosing prenatal exposure to ethanol. Materials & Methods: A total of 151 maternal hair strands (0-6 cm), nail clips (2-6 mm) and corresponding neonatal meconium and nails samples were obtained from neonatal wards of 4 Mediterranean public hospitals: Rome, Florence and Belluno in Italy and Barcelona in Spain. Hair, nails and meconium were analyzed for the presence of EtG by validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay. Meconium was also analyzed for the presence of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) as a complementary biomarker of in utero exposure to alcohol. Results: On the basis of the accepted cut-off for EtG and FAEEs in neonatal meconium, 18 newborns resulted in utero exposed to maternal alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, none of these cases were confirmed by the presence of EtG in maternal hair and nails, which resulted all negative to this biomarker. Conversely, one high positive result in nails (24 pg EtG/mg nail) was obtained in Pakistan woman, whose hair resulted negative to EtG likewise the meconium of her newborn. Low maternal education level was associated with biomarker scores over the cutoff. There was also a significant correlation between the highest percentage of prenatal exposure in the capital and certain maternal sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusion: Obtained results confirm that EtG and FAEEs in meconium are the best biomarker to assess in utero exposure to maternal alcohol. The 18 newborns exposed to maternal ethanol came from mothers who declared alcohol consumption through the entire pregnancy, but not on daily basis and with no more than 1 drink per day.This fact led us to suppose that firstly EtG in hair and nails is not a good biomarker to disclose an alcohol consumption lower than on daily basis and lower than one alcoholic unit per day. Secondly that both in case of hair and in that of nails, the amount of collected sample is crucial to obtain a positive result, since available methods are yet not enough sensitive for less than 20 mg keratin matrices.

N2  - Objectives: Awareness, education, and prevention are key to eliminating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which is a 100% preventable lifelong disability. The aim of this presentation is to share resources and ways that the community is being engaged in Edmonton, Canada. The main goals are to raise awareness, provide new resources, and to get conversations started so that we can put forth a clear message that no alcohol is best during pregnancy. A music video and cell phone ringtone have just been created and released in order to target youth and young adults. This video is a unique resource that is being used in various settings and has received extensive positive feedback. Prevention initiatives and a public health message will be at the forefront of this interactive presentation. Materials & Methods: A power point presentation will be used. Also, print materials will be handed out, the music video 'You Can Choose' will be shown that has been created in partnership with the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum of Services (FASS) and the Edmonton Fetal Alcohol Network (EFAN), and information will be provided on how to access the free ringtone. Results: The presentation shared resources and provided information on what new and unique tactics are being used in the Edmonton community to raise awareness about this invisible, preventable disability. Conclusion: As a community it is our responsibility to work together to raise awareness and to educate on FASD. By providing information and having an open discussion we can help to start these much needed conversations and begin to break down the stereotypes, misconceptions, and stigma associated with alcohol, pregnancy, and FASD.

N2  - Objectives: The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) was established by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol (NIAAA) in 2003 with the overall goal of improving the diagnoses of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). It is a multidisciplinary, multisite, international project combining both clinical and basic science projects. To date, CIFASD it has involved projects in seven different countries, including four in Europe. The major objective is to provide an overview and update on CIFASD, highlighting major accomplishments to date Materials & Methods: CIFASD utilizes a comprehensive approach to many of the critical questions in FASD research including improved diagnosis and enhanced understanding of the dysmorphology, neurobehavioral phenotypes, and neuropathology associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. One goal of CIFASD is to integrate information from three modalities (brain, face, and behavior) at a variety of ages, to guide early recognition of FASD with greater sensitivity. Our research projects utilize state-of-the-art techniques in brain imaging, craniofacial image analysis, behavioral phenotyping, and genetics. Results: Our brain imaging project is examining data longitudinally, as preliminary data suggest a difference in the trajectory of brain developmental between alcohol-exposed and control children. Our behavioral projects are refining the profiles of cognitive deficits following prenatal alcohol exposure, and showing similarities and differences between behaviors of children with an FASD compared to those with ADHD. Our work on facial imaging may better identify not only individuals with FAS, but also those with subclinical features. We are examining potential biomarkers of alcohol exposure, and how genetic and nutritional variables modify FASD to better identify individuals with, or at risk for FASD. Conclusion: Our efforts are accelerating progress in identifying children with prenatal alcohol exposure, which we envision will lead to earlier and improved interventions. This work should inform promising practices in the identification and treatment of individuals exposed to alcohol prenatally.

N2  - Objectives: Alcohol consumption by pregnant women is related to fetal damage resulting in a large spectrum of physical and behavioral problems in the offspring. This study aimed to assess fetal exposure to alcohol in pregnant women through questionnaires, interviews and postpartum data in a Brazilian sample of pregnant women. Materials & Methods: Data were collected longitudinally from 66 pregnant women since the first trimester of pregnancy as well from their newborns. All participants are living in the region of Ribeirao Preto, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The questionnaires T-ACE (Tolerance, Annoyed, Cut down, Eye-Opener) and AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) were employed as screening instruments for alcohol use. Postpartum information was collected such as: birth weight and length, childbirth delivery type and newborn gender. Results: T-ACE positive pregnant women scored 2.69 +/- 0.79 and 9.2 +/- 4.1 in the questionnaires T-ACE and AUDIT (N = 36), respectively. The average number of drinks in the first, second and third trimester was 50.4, 12.6 and 15.7, respectively for the T-ACE positive group. Two thirds (66.67%) of the sample of pregnant women were found as AUDIT positive (cut-off > 7.0). A statistically significant inverse Spearman correlation was found only for newborns of female sex for birth length and AUDIT total score (N = 16, rho = - 0.556, p = 0.025). No newborn was found as a clinical FAS case, and all other birth parameters were found in the normal range. Conclusion: No statistical differences were observed in relation to anthropometric variables except for birth length in the female newborn. Meconium samples have been collected and will help to complement this study, allowing comparison of these values with the information provided by pregnant women and providing an objective measure in order to validate the findings.

N2  - Objectives: The adverse effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy have been widely reported, and represent a leading preventable cause of physical and cognitive birth defects in the United States (Bertrand, 2009; Hoyme et al., 2005; Wilton and Plane, 2006). Brief, effective interventions are needed to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy in sexually active women who drink and do not use effective contraception. Materials & Methods: The Healthy Choices study compared the efficacy of a brief intervention delivered either over the telephone or in-person. In addition to indicators of alcohol use, contraception methods and compliance were examined, along with measures of mood and domestic violence. Women between the ages of 18 and 44 who were drinking above recommended levels and not using effective contraception were randomly assigned to either a telephone intervention group (n=68) or in-person intervention group (n=63). Results: Overall, participants showed significant reductions in alcohol use, and increases in effective use of contraception (thus reducing their risk of an alcoholexposed pregnancy). There was no significant difference in success of the intervention between the two conditions (telephone vs. in-person). Conclusion: Telephone-based brief intervention can be successful and cost-effective in reducing the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy and the incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Objectives: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are preventable birth defects directly linked to consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, resulting in a significant public health cost burden. Current estimates suggest that 1% or 5 million people are living with fetal alcohol brain injury in Europe. Many medical and allied health professionals are key to (1) primary prevention of FASDs through working with women of childbearing age and (2) secondary prevention through working with affected individuals whose lives can be greatly improved with knowledge based interventions. The aim of this work was to demonstrate the pressing and urgent need for European health and allied health service providers to upskill their employees with the knowledge and ability to deal and manage FASD affected children & adults. Materials & Methods: Participants were drawn from Social Work, Psychology and Foster & Adoptive Parents who participated in FASD training in three different European sites (Ireland, United Kingdom, and Poland) during 2011. Training was delivered using core material from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder(s) Competency - using Curriculum Development Guide for Medical and Allied Health Education and Practice (CDC) alongside relevant local data of prevalence rates of FASD and drinking rates in pregnancy as applicable to the site of the training. Data was collated using structured evaluation questionnaires along with themed group work within the training events. Results: Evaluations from these multi-site training events suggest that Training, Education and Policy development concerning FASD is sought by allied health professionals, Foster & Adoptive Parents in order to properly respond to the needs of individuals living with FASD. The data suggests that there is an increased need for awareness of the life long disability of FASD and the complex problems faced by professionals to respond in a professionally competent manner. Conclusion: The evaluation of three European training events suggest that competence, especially when viewed separately in terms of knowledge versus capacity for application of information, in the area of FASDs is lacking in both the provider and caring professionals. Addressing this may be best achieved through the undertaking of a structured 'Training Needs Analysis' in multiple sites throughout the EU.

N2  - Background: FASD is the term used to describe different categories of consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. Abnormal growth and characteristic physical features can be present in FASD, and then the diagnostic term is the fetal alcohol syndrome with complete or partial features. Materials & Methods: All systems used to establish diagnostic criteria for FASD (Institute of Medicine, Canadian guidelines, 4 digit coding system), assess the presence or absence of the 3 major physical features (short palpebral features, smooth philtrum and upper lip) growth deficits (height and weight <10%) and physical evidence of central nervous system involvement (microcephaly) to identify the different diagnostic categories. In order to identify the physical features associated with FAS, several important facts should be taken into account: 1). Expert physical diagnosis can be necessary. FAS is a dysmorphic syndrome with similar features to several genetic or other teratogenic syndromes with intellectual disability and behavioral problems. A differential diagnosis with other conditions should always be made, especially when the full pattern of malformation characteristic of FAS is not present. Genetic tests may be needed to rule out other causes. 2). Several studies have proven that additional facial features such as abnormal ears (railroad track ears), ptosis of the eyelids, midface hypoplasia and a long philtrum, are all characteristic features or FAS. Other characteristic non-facial features include contractures of one or multiple joints (camptodactyly and others), limitation of pronation and supination of the elbow, clinodatyly of the 5th finger of the hands, and most importantly, abnormal hand creases (hockey stick crease and others) are also very specific to FASD and should be taken into account for this diagnosis. 3) It has been proven that all these physical features together in a pattern are very specific to FAS, and their presence should be a firm indicator that the etiology of learning or behavioral problems is in fact prenatal exposure to alcohol. In the absence of physical findings, firm recognition of exposure or the presence of a very characteristic neurobehavioral profile are necessary in order to make a diagnosis of FASD. 4) Many of these features are predictors of more severe neurobehavioral involvement, and lower IQs are seen in patients with the most prominent physical features. They can be predictors of outcome, according to the number (dysmorphology scores) and severity of the growth deficits and the dysmorphic features. Conclusions: We believe the identification of these physical features should be part of the knowledge of any pediatrician of other professional dealing with children at risk for FASD, but only expert physical diagnosis can assess some difficult cases and make sure no other condition is present, especially in the absence of known prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - Background: The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical, mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objectives: Assessment of exposure to ethanol at both prenatal and postnatal stages is essential for early prevention and intervention. Since pregnant women tend to underreport alcohol drinking by questionnaires, a number of biological markers have been proposed and evaluated for their capability to highlight gestational drinking behaviour. Materials & Methods: These biomarkers include classical biomarkers (albeit indirect) of alcoholinduced pathology (mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) acetaldehyde-derived conjugates, and finally derivatives of nonoxidative ethanol metabolism (fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG), ethyl sulphate (EtS) and phosphaditylethanol (PEth)). Since ethanol itself and acetaldehyde are only measured few hours after ethanol intake in conventional matrices such as blood, urine and sweat, they are only useful to detect recent ethanol exposure. In the past few years, the non-oxidative ethanol metabolites have received increasing attention because of their specificity and in some case wide time-window of detection in non-conventional matrices from the pregnant mother (oral fluid and hair) and fetusnewborn (neonatal hair, meconium, placenta and umbilical cord). Conclusions: This presentation reviews the markers of ethanol consumption during pregnancy and related prenatal exposure. In addition, clinical toxicological applications of these procedures are presented and discussed.

N2  - Objectives: This investigation's aim is to study features of maternal consumption of alcohol and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia, Russia). Materials & Methods: Quality and rate of Maternal Alcohol Consumption observation in 11 regions (uluses) by means of the interviews, physical assessment and study of case histories according to CDC recommendations (2004). Incidence and clinical features of FAS study in 13 uluses, orphanages and National Medical Center. 26 caucasian, 18 sakha and 12 native (evens, evenks) with FAS aged from 40 postmenstrual weeks to 7 years detailed observation by means of 4-digit Diagnostic Code, routine and agedependent developmental neurological assessment, brain ultrasonography, MRI, Denver test and Zhurba Scale. Results: Analysis of maternal alcohol consumption shows that from 0.7 to 6.1% of pregnant women in different uluses used alcohol, and from 0.2 to 4.5% drank heavily. There are no significant differences in maternal alcohol consumption in different ethnical groups. Incidence of FAS varies from 0.06 to 0.9% in child population of different uluses. We haven't found significant correlation between maternal alcohol consumption level and incidence of FAS in the uluses (r = 0.559; p = 0.093).Incidence of FAS varies from 0.3% in National Medical Center to 11.3-34.0% in orphanages. Our investigation demonstrates that native babies with FAS were born pre-term much oftener than sakha infants (chi2 = 4.54; p = 0.033). Sakha children with FAS have smaller birth weight and height than caucasian ones (chi2 = 4.35-5.90; p = 0.037-0.015). Clinical assessment and neurovisualization show that caucasian patients have ptosis and ventriculodilatation significantly more frequently than sakha babies (chi2 = 5.11-5.97; p = 0.024-0.015); sakha infants have much more frequently muscle tone deviations, inborn heart defects, visual nerve atrophy and subarachnoid space dilatation than other ones (chi2 = 11.55-4.10; p = 0.0007-0.043). Native children demonstrate better quality of social adaptation than caucasian babies (chi2 = 10.26-4.10; p = 0.0014). Conclusion: Our investigation shows the necessity of taking into account ethnical and regional features of maternal alcohol consumption and FAS manifestation in epidemiological and clinical study.

N2  - Objectives: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a very common and completely avoidable disease. FAS has severe consequences not only for the individual and its direct environment but also for the health and social system in Germany. Aims: The first aim of the development of the German guideline was the determination of evidence-based and in practice easily applicable diagnostic criteria for the identification of FAS in children and adolescents in Germany. With help of the defined diagnostic criteria FAS should be diagnosed and treated earlier, so secondary complications can be reduced. The second aim was to create awareness in the German society of the severe complications of intrauterine alcohol exposition in order to decrease the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and diminish the incidence of FAS. Materials & Methods: A steering group in Munich and a consensus group consisting of representatives of the German Federal Ministry of Health, the German Professional Societies of Pediatrics, Neuropediatrics, Social Pediatrics, Gynecology, Neonatology, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Addiction Research and Therapy, Addiction Medicine, Addiction Psychology, Midwife Sciences, Midwives, Doctors of the Public Health Service, of the Patient Support Group FASworld Germany and additional FAS experts have been established in 2011. The AWMF (Association of the scientific medical societies) was responsible for the methodological guidance. Systematic literature retrieval and determination of levels of evidence were conducted by the AZQ (Medical Center for Quality in Medicine). Results: The methodological quality of the international and especially the German publications about the diagnostic criteria are rather poor. Most of the existing international guidelines for the diagnosis of FAS are consensus- but not strictly evidence-based. Evidence-and consensus-based criteria for the diagnosis of FAS were evaluated and established for Germany. The methodological process is described. The implication of the guideline is performed by algorithms for pediatricians and general practitioners for the referral of children with suspected FAS. Another algorithm including the defined diagnostic criteria of FAS has been developed for experts Conclusion: There is great need for a standardized, multidisciplinary, quality assured and implementable prevention of FAS in Germany. The first step was the development of an evidence- and consensus-based diagnostic guideline for children with FAS in Germany.

N2  - Objectives: Diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is complex, with numerous competing diagnostic systems. All recent diagnostic systems require the presence of growth restriction, mental retardation and 3 characteristic facial features. Software developed at the University of Washington has been created to objectively analyse digital photographs, measuring for the unique triad of FAS facial features: small palprebral fissure length (PFL), thin upper lip and smooth philtrum. This software has been validated in older children, but has not been used in neonates. We are unable to find neonatal normal reference ranges for measures except PFL. Early diagnosis in children has been associated with better outcomes. This study aims to determine the feasibility of using the facial analysis software to identify features associated with fetal alcohol exposure in normal neonates and if successful to develop normal reference ranges for Caucasian neonates. Materials & Methods: Ethics approval and informed consent was obtained. Healthy Caucasian neonates were photographed according to a standardised protocol. Mothers were asked to fill out an anonymous lifestyle questionnaire including questions on alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Standard physical measurements of the baby were taken. PFL and upper lip circularity (LC) were measured using the software. Philtrum smoothness and LC was assessed on a 5 point likert scale using reference photos. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Results: 33 neonates were recruited. PFL was measurable in 24 photographs (72.7%). Mean PFL was 15.5mm (95% C.I 13.1 - 17.9mm).LC was measurable in 33 photographs (100%). Mean LC was 59.4 (95% C.I. 18.1 - 100.5). Median LC and philtrum smoothness Likert ranks were both 3. 4 neonates were assessed as having FAS type features according to Likert ranking including 2 with abstinent mothers. 7 mothers (21.2%) reported drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Conclusion: It was possible to measure a full data set on just over 3/4 of neonates, demonstrating the feasibility of this method at this age. Mean PFL from this pilot study was significantly below previous published reference ranges. Current Likert scale reference photos may not be appropriate for neonates. Further data collection is required for development of robust reference ranges using this method.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of comprehensive community-based interventions to reduce fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in two populations from the Northern Cape Province in South Africa. Materials & Methods: Changes in the prevalence of FASD, and in maternal knowledge and drinking behaviour, were assessed in De Aar and Upington, Northern Cape Province, before and after an intensive community-level intervention. Eight community workers implemented educational activities to raise awareness of the risks of maternal drinking and to alter community norms about alcohol use in pregnancy. All children were examined by two dysmorphologists at 9 months of age and those with evidence of FASD were reassessed at 18 months. Neuropsychometrists evaluated infant neurodevelopment. Structured maternal interviews with FASD cases and matched controls determined patterns of alcohol use and knowledge about FASD. Results: At baseline, 809 children were evaluated, 751 after intervention. FASD prevalence pre-intervention was 8.9% (72/809) and 5.7% post intervention (43/751; P=0.02). In multivariate logistic regression, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity, FASD prevalence was 0.73 fold lower post-intervention than pre-intervention (95%CI=0.58-0.90; P=0.004). Dysmorphology scores reduced from 4 at baseline (IQR=2-7) to 3 (IQR=1-6; P=0.002). After intervention, a large proportion of women reported having received educational messages, levels of knowledge about alcohol increased and some changes were detected in attitudes to drinking. Conclusion: Comprehensive community-level interventions might reduce the burden of FASD in heavily-affected areas of South Africa, by about 30%. This, the first study ever to document the effectiveness of FASD prevention using clinical outcomes, suggests that comprehensive community-level services should be implemented in similar settings to reduce this very common, oft neglected, disorder.

N2  - Background: Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, has recently been detected in cord blood of infants born to alcohol-abusing mothers. Formic acid detoxification requires folic acid. However, in a rodent model, placental folate-receptors have decreased expression after alcohol exposure. We hypothesize that folate transport to the fetus will be decreased after chronic alcohol exposure and that these decreased levels will limit the ability to detoxify formic acid. These factors may, in part, contribute to deficits in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Objectives: To determine if alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in lower folate transport to the fetus and whether lower folate levels decrease the ability to detoxify formic acid. Methods: Serum folate was measured in maternal and cord blood at delivery from alcohol-abusing mothers and controls. As an in vitro model, a choriocarcinoma cell line (BeWo) was characterized after culturing in folate-free conditions. Results: The fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was <1.0 in half of the alcohol-exposed pairs (n=12), whereas all of the controls were >1.0 (n=8). Mean folate in cord samples was lower in alcohol-exposed cord than in the controls (25.83 +/- 13.58 vs. 44.04 +/- 10.86, p<0.01). BeWo cells were found to proliferate and maintain normal morphology when introduced into folate-free DMEM. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that folic acid transport to the human fetus is compromised in pregnancies affected by alcohol-abuse. BeWo cells can proliferate under folate-free conditions and will be utilized to investigate formate kinetics and toxicity.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders result from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and are characterized, in some cases, by central nervous system anomalies and cognitive impairment. Regional patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities suggest that alcohol exerts selective damage on the developing fetal brain. This study assessed brain-behavior relationships in a sample of youth with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. The aim was to characterize how structural brain alterations observed in our previous studies relate to cognitive deficits commonly reported in individuals with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Twenty-one youth (mean age 13 years) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 7 nonexposed healthy comparison subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and neurobehavioral testing. Regional brain volumes within the alcohol-exposed group were correlated with neuropsychological measures of cognitive control and verbal learning/recall, as these aspects of cognition have previously been shown to be vulnerable to alcohol teratogenesis. Results: Between-group effect sizes revealed moderate to large cognitive performance and brain volume decrements in alcohol-exposed subjects, compared with typically developing peers. Within the alcohol-exposed group, volume of the caudate nuclei was the most consistent predictor of neuropsychological performance, after controlling for potentially confounding variables including total brain volume, IQ, and age. Conclusions: These data are consistent with previous research associating gestational alcohol exposure with structural and functional changes of the caudate nucleus. Our findings extend this previous work by demonstrating that volume reductions of the caudate have behavioral relevance for this population, in relation to cognitive control and verbal learning and recall abilities. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy causes birth defects and lifelong disabilities in the affected children. Due to the wide range of symptoms related to prenatal alcohol exposition, the umbrella term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is used. FASD covers full Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (pFAS). Children with FAS are smaller in length and weight than healthy children of their age. Head circumference s smaller as well. Typical signs of FAS are facial characteristics such small eyes, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip. Many affected children only show distinct behavioural problems (pFAS). Children with FAS or pFAS do not recognize dangerous situations, they would go with anyone, and are easily influenced. They are forgetful, do not learn from consequences. The diagnosis of FAS goes by small size and weight of the children, and the typical facial alterations. pFAS, however, is diagnosed if behavioural, social and emotional problems are present, and prenatal alcohol exposition is assured by anamnesis. Medical treatment is supplemented by occupational and behavioural therapy. The affected children need instruction, orientation, apportionment concerning time (and space), and a firm daily routine. At legal age, most patients with FASD are not able to live autonomously. They are naive and easily talked into things, therefore they require long-lasting care.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading non-genetic cause of neurodevelopmental disability in children. Although alcohol is clearly teratogenic, environmental factors such as gravidity and socioeconomic status significantly modify individual FASD risk despite equivalent alcohol intake. An explanation for this variability could inform FASD prevention. Here we show that the most common nutritional deficiency of pregnancy, iron deficiency without anemia (ID), is a potent and synergistic modifier of FASD risk. Using an established rat model of third trimester-equivalent binge drinking, we show that ID significantly interacts with alcohol to impair postnatal somatic growth, associative learning, and white matter formation, as compared with either insult separately. For the associative learning and myelination deficits, the ID-alcohol interaction was synergistic and the deficits persisted even after the offsprings' iron status had normalized. Importantly, the observed deficits in the ID-alcohol animals comprise key diagnostic criteria of FASD. Other neurobehaviors were normal, showing the ID-alcohol interaction was selective and did not reflect a generalized malnutrition. Importantly ID worsened FASD outcome even though the mothers lacked overt anemia; thus diagnostics that emphasize hematological markers will not identify pregnancies at-risk. This is the first direct demonstration that, as suggested by clinical studies, maternal iron status has a unique influence upon FASD outcome. While alcohol is unquestionably teratogenic, this ID-alcohol interaction likely represents a significant portion of FASD diagnoses because ID is more common in alcohol-abusing pregnancies than generally appreciated. Iron status may also underlie the associations between FASD and parity or socioeconomic status. We propose that increased attention to normalizing maternal iron status will substantially improve FASD outcome, even if maternal alcohol abuse continues. These findings offer novel insights into how alcohol damages the developing brain. © 2012 Rufer et al.

N2  - Ethanol is a legal and widely available substance. There are health and social consequences associated with its abuse. One of the most important problems is related to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In fact, prenatal ethanol exposure can be associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), a term used to describe a wide range of potentially lifelong effects that include physical, mental, behavioral, and learning disabilities. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), which are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol, are currently used as biomarkers of direct ethanol consumption in different matrices, including hair, blood, skin surface, and meconium. Analysis of these compounds in meconium reveals exposure to alcohol during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. An important finding for evaluation of gestational ethanol exposure is the fact that FAEEs do not cross the placenta. Because they accumulate in the fetal gut from approximately the 20th week of gestation until birth, this provides a wide window of detection of chronic exposure to alcohol. The sum of the concentrations of all the FAEEs, with a cutoff of 2 nmol g -1 or 600 ng g-1 meconium, has been recommended as evidence of maternal alcohol use. We introduce a novel technique to quantify ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl stearate, and their deuterated analogues (as internal standards, IS) in meconium using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Limits of detection and quantification were 50 and 100 ng g-1 for all analytes except ethyl stearate (LOD 100 ng g-1 and LOQ 500 ng g-1). Calibration curves were linear from the LOQ to 5000 ng g-1. The validated method was applied to the analysis of 81 meconium samples. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy may result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which is an umbrella term used to describe a range of conditions that are associated with significant neurodevelopmental impairments. Communicating an FASD diagnosis to a child is a complex and difficult task that requires a great deal of care, particularly due to the sensitive nature of the etiology of these disorders. To the best of our knowledge, there are no formal guidelines or published materials that outline the ethical considerations specifically associated with disclosing an FASD diagnosis to a child. This paper discusses a number of ethical principles and situational factors that should be considered when communicating an FASD diagnosis, as well as some of the potential risks and benefits associated with disclosure. We also provide recommendations to assist clinicians in communicating the diagnosis in a manner that increases understanding and minimizes harm to the child. Future recommendations include the development of formalized guidelines in order to aid clinicians in carrying out this sensitive task. © 2012 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Background: Most children who are exposed to large quantities of alcohol in utero do not develop fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Population-based prospective data on the risk of developing components of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), however, are limited. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of 9,628 women screened during their first prenatal appointment in Chile, which identified 101 who consumed at least 4 drinks/d (exposed) matched with 101 women with no reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy (unexposed). Detailed alcohol consumption data were collected during the pregnancy. Children were evaluated up to 8.5 years of age by clinicians masked to exposure status. Results: One or more functional central nervous system abnormalities were present in 44.0% (22/50) of the exposed children compared to 13.6% (6/44) of the unexposed (p = 0.002). Growth restriction was present in 27.2% (25/92) of the exposed and 12.5% (12/96) of the unexposed (p = 0.02). Abnormal facial features were present in 17.3% (14/81) of the exposed children compared to 1.1% (1/89) of the unexposed children (p = 0.0002) by direct examination. Of the 59 exposed children with data available to detect at least 1 abnormality, 12 (20.3%) had no abnormalities. Binge drinking from conception to recognition of pregnancy (OR = 1.48 per day, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.91, p = 0.002) and after recognition of pregnancy (OR= 1.41 per day, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.95, p = 0.04) and total number of drinks consumed per week from conception to recognition of pregnancy (OR = 1.02 per drink, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.04, p = 0.0009) were significantly associated with abnormal child outcome. Conclusions: After exposure to heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy, 80% of children had 1 or more abnormalities associated with alcohol exposure. Patterns of alcohol use that posed the greatest risk of adverse outcomes were binge drinking and high total weekly intake. Functional neurologic impairment occurred most frequently and may be the only sign to alert physicians to prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Both sensory and cognitive deficits have been associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol; however, very few studies have focused on sensory deficits in preschool-aged children. As sensory skills develop early, characterization of sensory deficits using novel imaging methods may reveal important neural markers of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Participants in this study were 10 children with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and 15 healthy control (HC) children aged 3 to 6 years. All participants had normal hearing as determined by clinical screens. We measured their neurophysiological responses to auditory stimuli (1,000 Hz, 72 dB tone) using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We used a multidipole spatio-temporal modeling technique to identify the location and timecourse of cortical activity in response to the auditory tones. The timing and amplitude of the left and right superior temporal gyrus sources associated with activation of left and right primary/secondary auditory cortices were compared across groups. Results: There was a significant delay in M100 and M200 latencies for the FASD children relative to the HC children (p = 0.01), when including age as a covariate. The within-subjects effect of hemisphere was not significant. A comparable delay in M100 and M200 latencies was observed in children across the FASD subtypes. Conclusions: Auditory delay revealed by MEG in children with FASDs may prove to be a useful neural marker of information processing difficulties in young children with prenatal alcohol exposure. The fact that delayed auditory responses were observed across the FASD spectrum suggests that it may be a sensitive measure of alcohol-induced brain damage. Therefore, this measure in conjunction with other clinical tools may prove useful for early identification of alcohol affected children, particularly those without dysmorphia. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Pathological changes in skeletal remains are difficult to diagnose, but may provide some clues as to the personal history and identification of an individual. In 2011, a skeletonized forensic case of a juvenile individual was received from the Northern Cape. The remains were suspected to have belonged to a girl who went missing in 2003. The aim of this study is to report on the findings from this case. Anthropological assessment indicated that the remains possibly belonged to a female individual of 12-15 years. Several pathological changes and skeletal abnormalities were observed which included an abnormally shaped head with bulging forehead, slight microcephaly, facial asymmetry, enamel hypoplasia, cribra orbitalia, spina bifida occulta of L1, and growth retardation. A tentative diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made, and it was later confirmed by SAPS that the suspected parents of this individual have a history of alcohol abuse. FAS occurs in children born to women who consume large quantities of alcohol during pregnancy. This condition presents various degrees of severity, and this case probably represents an extreme version of FAS. Differential diagnosis would include malnutrition, chronic infectious disease, or mental retardation of other causes. Although not conclusive, the combination of abnormalities seen in this individual is strongly suggestive of FAS, and to our knowledge this is the first skeletal case with this condition to be reported.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Not all women who consume alcohol during pregnancy have children with FASD and studies have shown that genetic factors can play a role in ethanol teratogenesis. We examined gene expression in embryos and placentae from C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice following prenatal alcohol exposure. B6 fetuses are susceptible to morphological malformations following prenatal alcohol exposure while D2 are relatively resistant. Methods: Male and female B6 and D2 mice were mated for 2 hours in the morning, producing 4 embryonic genotypes: true-bred B6B6 and D2D2, and reciprocal B6D2 and D2B6. On gestational day 9, dams were intubated with 5.8 g/kg ethanol, an isocaloric amount of maltose dextrin, or nothing. Four hours later, dams were sacrificed and embryos and placentae were harvested. RNA was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 v2 microarray chips. Data were normalized, subjected to analysis of variance and tested for enrichment of gene ontology molecular function and biological process using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Results: Several gene classes were differentially expressed in B6 and D2 regardless of treatment, including genes involved in polysaccharide binding and mitosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure altered expression of a subset of genes, including genes involved in methylation, chromatin remodeling, protein synthesis, and mRNA splicing. Very few genes were differentially expressed between maltose-exposed tissues and tissues that received nothing, so we combined these groups for comparisons with ethanol. While we observed many expression changes specific to B6 following prenatal alcohol exposure, none were specific for D2. Gene classes up- or down-regulated in B6 following prenatal alcohol exposure included genes involved in mRNA splicing, transcription, and translation. Conclusions: Our study identified several classes of genes with altered expression following prenatal alcohol exposure, including many specific for B6, a strain susceptible to ethanol teratogenesis. Lack of strain specific effects in D2 suggests there are few gene expression changes that confer resistance. Future studies will begin to analyze functional significance of the expression changes. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: The identification of individuals exposed prenatally to alcohol can be challenging, with only those having the characteristic pattern of facial features, central nervous system abnormality, and growth retardation receiving a clinical diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Methods: Seventeen anthropometric measurements were obtained at 5 and 9 years from 125 Cape Town, South African children, studied since birth. The children were divided into 3 groups: FAS or partial FAS (PFAS), heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE), and non-alcohol-exposed controls (C). Anthropometric measurements were evaluated for mean group differences. Logistic regression models were used to identify the subset of anthropometric measures that best predicted group membership. Anthropometric measurements were examined at the 2 ages in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure obtained prospectively from the mothers during pregnancy. Correlation of these facial measurements with key neurobehavioral outcomes including Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-IV IQ and eyeblink conditioning was used to assess their utility as indicators of alcohol-related central nervous system impairment. Results: Significant group differences were found for the majority of the anthropometric measures, with means of these measures smaller in the FAS/PFAS compared with HE or C. Upper facial widths, ear length, lower facial depth, and eye widths were consistent predictors distinguishing those exposed to alcohol from those who were not. Using longitudinal data, unique measures were identified that predicted facial anomalies at one age but not the other, suggesting the face changes as the individual matures. And 41% of the FAS/PFAS group met criteria for microtia at both ages. Three of the predictive anthropometric measures were negatively related to measures of prenatal alcohol consumption, and all were positively related to at least 1 neurobehavioral outcome. Conclusions: The analysis of longitudinal data identified a common set of predictors, as well as some that are unique at each age. Prenatal alcohol exposure appears to have its primary effect on brain growth, reflected by smaller forehead widths, and may suppress neural crest migration to the branchial arches, reflected by deficits in ear length and mandibular dimensions. These results may improve diagnostic resolution and enhance our understanding of the relation between the face and the neuropsychological deficits that occur. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a common cause of intellectual impairment and birth defects. More recently, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been found to be a risk factor for fetal mortality, stillbirth and infant and child mortality. This has led to increased concern about detection and management of PAE. One to 2 h after maternal ingestion, fetal blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) reach levels nearly equivalent to maternal levels. Ethanol elimination by the fetus is impaired because of reduced metabolic capacity. Fetal exposure time is prolonged owing to the reuptake of amniotic-fluid containing ethanol by the fetus. Alcohol elimination from the fetus relies on the mother's metabolic capacity. Metabolic capacity among pregnant women varies eightfold (from 0.0025 to 0.02 g dl-1 h-1), which may help explain how similar amounts of ethanol consumption during pregnancy results in widely varying phenotypic presentations of FASD. At birth physiological changes alter the neonate's metabolic capacity and it rapidly rises to a mean value of 83.5% of the mother's capacity. FASDs are highly recurrent and younger siblings have increased risk. Detection of prenatal alcohol use offers an important opportunity for office-based interventions to decrease exposure for the remainder of pregnancy and identification of women who need substance abuse treatment. Mothers of children with FAS have been found to drink faster, get drunk quicker and to have higher BACs. A modest increase in the prevalence of a polymorphism of alcohol dehydrogenase, which increases susceptibility to adverse outcomes from PAE has been reported. Lastly, detection of alcohol use and appropriate management would decrease risk from PAE for subsequent pregnancies. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading cause of intellectual disability in the Western world. Due to the organic brain damage caused by alcohol, and the resulting cognitive, functional, and behavioural deficits, people with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) are at high risk for becoming involved in the legal system, either as offenders or as victims, if appropriate diagnosis, interventions and support services are not initiated early in life and maintained throughout the life-course. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of incarceration for youths (12-18 years) with FASD, compared to youths without FASD, in Canada. Using the epidemiological data available on the prevalence of incarceration in youths with FASD and data on the prevalence of incarceration in youths without FASD in the general population of Canada, it was estimated that youths with FASD are nineteen times more likely to be imprisoned than youths without FASD, on any given day in a specific year. These alarming study findings emphasize the need to incorporate screening for FASD as early as possible in the criminal justice process. It is crucial to better understand the mental disabilities of offenders prenatally exposed to alcohol and make appropriate referrals for mental health and other services.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the leading preventable cause of developmental disabilities in the United States and likely throughout the world. FASDs can be prevented by avoiding alcohol use during pregnancy; however, efforts to prevent risky alcohol consumption in women of childbearing potential have not been universally successful. Objectives: Data suggest that successful interventions may require tailoring methods to meet the needs of specific populations and cultures. Key findings of interventions previously tested among American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) women who are or may become pregnant, data gaps, and promising ongoing interventions are reviewed. Methods: A systematic review of the current literature on empirically based interventions among AI/AN women was conducted. Selected alternative approaches currently being tested in AI/AN settings are also described. Results: Similar to findings among other populations of women in the United States, a number of interventions have been implemented; however, only a small number have measured results. Approaches have included standard interventions involving hospitalization, inpatient, or outpatient care; wellness education; traditional approaches; and case management for high-risk women. An ongoing Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocol comparing the effectiveness of a web-based culturally adapted tool, or a peer health educator model to standard clinical practice is described. Conclusion: Translation of successful interventions from other settings to AI/AN populations holds promise. Scientific Significance: FASDs represent a significant health issue with high personal and societal costs. Improvement of interventions to prevent prenatal alcohol consumption in specific populations, including AI/AN women, is a critical public health need. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - While it is known that suboptimal maternal vitamin D status can be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, the frequency of low vitamin D status in many populations is a subject of debate. Our ongoing study investigates the nutrient status of alcohol-exposed Ukrainian pregnant women and whether micronutrient supplementation can reduce the risk of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Blood samples and alcohol consumption data are collected at the time of enrollment (mean gestational age, 20.4 +/-7.0 wk). Here we present data on the baseline vitamin D status of these women. Mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [25(OH)D] of alcohol-exposed (n=180) and unexposed (n=180) women were 20.6 ng/mL and 21.8 ng/mL, respectively. Across both groups, 50.6% and 32.9% were classified as vitamin D deficient [25(OH)D <20ng/mL] or insufficient [25(OH)D >20 ng/mL and <30 ng/mL], respectively. When adjusted for solar radiation by month, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestation age at blood draw, smoking status, and age, regression analyses showed that each additional oz. of alcohol consumed per drinking day, in the 2 weeks prior to the time of enrollment, was associated with a 2.4 ng/mL decrease in 25(OH)D concentrations (P=0.03). These data suggest a very high prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D status in pregnant Ukrainian women and an adverse effect of alcohol consumption on vitamin D status.

N2  - The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical, mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objective assessment of exposure to ethanol at both prenatal and postnatal stages is essential for early prevention and intervention. Since pregnant women tend to underreport alcohol drinking by questionnaires, a number of biological markers have been proposed and evaluated for their capability to highlight gestational drinking behaviour. These biomarkers include classical biomarkers (albeit indirect) of alcohol-induced pathology (mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) acetaldehyde-derived conjugates, and finally derivatives of non-oxidative ethanol metabolism (fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG), ethyl sulphate (EtS) and phosphaditylethanol (PEth)). Since ethanol itself and acetaldehyde are only measured few hours after ethanol intake in conventional matrices such as blood, urine and sweat, they are only useful to detect recent ethanol exposure. In the past few years, the non-oxidative ethanol metabolites have received increasing attention because of their specificity and in some case wide time-window of detection in non-conventional matrices from the pregnant mother (oral fluid and hair) and fetus-newborn (neonatal hair, meconium, placenta and umbilical cord). This article reviews bioanalytical procedures for the determination of these markers of ethanol consumption during pregnancy and related prenatal exposure. In addition, clinical toxicological applications of these procedures are presented and discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

From this group, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the only disorder coded in the International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10). This coding was used to gain an understanding on the health care utilization and the mortality rate for individuals diagnosed with FAS, as well as to estimate the associated health care costs in Canada for the most recent available fiscal year (2008-2009). Methods: Health care utilization data associated with a diagnosis of FAS were directly obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). Mortality data associated with a diagnosis of FAS were obtained from Statistics Canada. Results: The total direct health care cost of acute care, psychiatric care, day surgery, and emergency department services associated with FAS in Canada in 2008-2009, based on the official CIHI data, was about $6.7 million. The vast majority of the most responsible diagnoses, which account for the majority of a patient's length of stay in hospital, fall within the ICD-10 category Mental and Behavioural Disorders (F00-F99). It was evident that the burden and cost of acute care hospitalizations due to FAS is increasing -1.6 times greater in 2008-2009, compared to 2002-2003. The mortality data due to FAS, obtained from Statistics Canada (2000-2008), may be underreported, and are likely invalid. Discussion: The official data on the utilization of health care services by individuals diagnosed with FAS are likely to be underreported and therefore, the reported cost figures are most likely underestimated. The quantification of the health care costs associated with FAS is crucial for policy developers and decision makers alike, of the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure, with the ultimate goal of initiating preventive interventions to address FASD. © 2012 Popova et al.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: In the rat, binge-like ethanol (EtOH) exposure during the early neonatal period (a developmental period equivalent to the human third trimester) can result in a permanent deficit of cerebellar Purkinje cells (Pcells). However, the consequences of a moderate binge alcohol exposure on a single day during this postnatal period have not been established. This is an issue of importance as many pregnant women binge drink periodically at social drinking levels. This study aimed to identify both the acute and long-term effects of exposure to a single alcohol binge that achieved a mean peak blood EtOH concentration of approximately 250 mg/dl during early postnatal life using a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Methods: Acute apoptotic Pcell death 10 hours after a moderate dose binge EtOH exposure from postnatal days (PDs) 0 to 10 was assessed using active caspase-3 immunolabeling. Acute Pcell apoptosis was quantified in cerebellar vermal lobules I-X using the physical disector method. Long-term effects were assessed at PD 60 using stereological methods to determine total Pcell numbers in the vermis, lobule III, and lobule IX, following a moderate dose binge EtOH exposure at PDs 0, 2, or 4. Results: Acute apoptosis was induced by EtOH on PDs 1 to 8 in a time and lobular-dependent manner. For EtOH exposure on PD 2, significant long-term Pcell loss occurred in lobule III. EtOH exposure on PD 4 resulted in significant long-term Pcell loss throughout the entire vermis. Conclusions: These results indicate that a single, early EtOH episode of moderate dose can create significant and permanent Pcell loss in the developing cerebellum. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability. The mechanisms underlying FASD are incompletely understood, and biomarkers to identify those at risk are lacking. Here, we perform metabolomic analysis of embryoid bodies and neural lineages derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells to identify the neural secretome produced in response to ethanol (EtOH) exposure. Methods: WA01 and WA09 hES cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies, neural progenitors, or neurons. Cells along this progression were cultured for 4 days with 0, 0.1, or 0.3% EtOH. Supernatants were subjected to C18 chromatography followed by ESI-QTOF-MS. Features were annotated using public databases, and the identities of 4 putative biomarkers were confirmed with purified standards and comparative MS/MS. Results: EtOH treatment induced statistically significant changes to metabolite abundance in human embryoid bodies (180 features), neural progenitors (76 features), and neurons (42 features). There were no shared significant features between different cell types. Fifteen features showed a dose-response to EtOH. Four chemical identities were confirmed: l-thyroxine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, and the tryptophan metabolites, l-kynurenine and indoleacetaldehyde. One feature with a putative annotation of succinyladenosine was significantly increased in both EtOH treatments. Additional features were selective to EtOH treatment but were not annotated in public databases. Conclusions: EtOH exposure induces statistically significant changes to the metabolome profile of human embryoid bodies, neural progenitors, and neurons. Several of these metabolites are normally present in human serum, suggesting their usefulness as potential serum FASD biomarkers. These findings suggest the biochemical pathways that are affected by EtOH in the developing nervous system and delineate mechanisms of alcohol injury during human development. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and particularly, the most severe manifestation, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), are more common in disadvantaged populations. Developmental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) may be potentiated by environmental factors like suboptimal nutrition, found in emerging countries. To evaluate potential benefits of micronutrients, including choline, in the teratogenesis of PAE in an at risk population, we carried out a clinical trial at two Omni-Net sites in Western Ukraine, Khmelnitsky and Rivne. Methods. Alcohol-using and nondrinking women were recruited midpregnancy and randomized to one of three groups: multivitamin/multimineral supplement (MVM); MVM+choline; nonsupplemented group. Children (N=192) were followed-up at six months gestational age with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd ED) yielding standard scores for Mental Development Index (MDI), Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) and measures of orientation, emotional reactivity, motor performance and total behavioral functioning. Results. Generalized Linear Modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between amount of alcohol used (ounces of absolute alcohol per day preconception and during the two weeks prior to enrollment) with developmental outcomes. We collapsed the two supplement groups (Suppl group) and controlled effects of social class (SES), smoking, gender, vitamin and folic acid use prior to recruitment. At six months, MDI was significantly impacted by alcohol dose during the first trimester (beta=-14.66, X2(1)=9.3, p<.002) with those exposed to more alcohol having lower cognitive scores. Moreover, there was also an effect of Suppl with those who did not receive supplements performing more poorly (beta=-3.69, X2(1)=8.03, p<.005). The PDI scores did not differ by intervention group but showed a significant effect of 1st trimester alcohol dose (beta=-26.99, X2(1)=8.28, p<.004) on motor function. Orientation behavior also differed as a function of Suppl Group ((beta=-5.45, X2(1)=4.51, p<.03) and as a result of alcohol dose at conception (beta=-4.52, X2(1)=5.75, p<.02); Motor Optimality was affected by alcohol dose at conception and during the 1st trimester and there were no effects of factors measured on Emotional reactivity at this age. These results suggest that multimicronutrient supplementation can reduce the negative impact of alcohol use during pregnancy on specific developmental outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Novel interventions to prevent or ameliorate the effects of human teratogens have rarely been identified. Although the optimum prevention for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is to avoid pregnancy exposure entirely, efforts to change maternal behaviors with respect to alcohol have been less than universally successful. The possibility of a low-cost, acceptable, and effective intervention that would attenuate some of the prenatal effects of alcohol has important implications worldwide. Methods: In the context of the NIH-NIAAA Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, a multimicronutrient supplement intervention study has been ongoing in two regions of Ukraine. A total of 300 moderately to heavily alcohol-exposed pregnant women and 300 low or unexposed comparison women were recruited on average in the second trimester. Maternal nutritional status was assessed in blood at the time of enrollment, and women were randomly assigned within alcohol exposure group to one of three groups: multimicronutrient supplement, multimicronutrient supplement with an additional supplement containing 700mg. of choline, or standard of care. Outcomes measured included a standard dysmorphology examination for physical features of FASD in the newborn period and again at six and 12 months of age, and neurobehavioral assessments using two different paradigms at six and 12 months of age. Results: Baseline maternal nutritional status on selected micronutrients is associated with risk for selected alcohol-related facial features among those in the alcohol-exposed group, suggesting that maternal nutritional status early in development may be a protective or permissive factor for initiation of some structural effects in infants born to drinking mothers. Furthermore, among 6-month olds tested with the Bay ley, the effect of dose of alcohol was attenuated by multimicronutrient supplementation. Conclusion: The role of maternal nutritional status in moderating the effects of prenatal alcohol consumption is evolving as a potentially important factor. Moreover, the concept that a simple, low-cost intervention with vitamin-mineral supplements, initiated after recognition of pregnancy, can potentially rescue infants from some degree of deficit has important implications for prevention and intervention in multiple economic and cultural settings.

N2  - Alcohol consumption of mothers during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome associated with massive neuronal apoptosis. Acute exposure of developing rodents to alcohol causes likewise extensive apoptotic neurodegeneration throughout the brain. In our research we used 7 day-old mice as a model of fetal alcohol syndrom in humans. Using activated caspase-3 and TUNEL staining as markers of the apoptotic process we demonstrated that taurine at a dose of 2 g/kg saves in 7 day-old mice about 50% of dying neurons in the external and internal layers of the cerebellum from ethanol-induced apoptosis. In an attempt to rescue more neurons we increased the taurine dose two- and threefold. Ethanol (20% w/v solution) was administered subcutaneously at a total dose of 5 g/kg (2.5 g/kg at 1 h and 2.5 g/kg at 3 h). Taurine (7% solution) was injected in two half-doses (first at 0 h and second at 4 h). Opposite to our expectations the increased taurine doses administered to ethanol-injected mice induced death. The dose of 4 g/kg co-administered with ethanol killed 50% of mice and the dose of 6 g/kg killed them all. All mice treated with ethanol or taurine alone survived. We repeated the same regime in adult (5-6 months) and old (12-13 months) mice with different doses of ethanol and taurine injected intraperitoneally. The co-administration of taurine at a total dose of 10 g/kg with ethanol (8 g/kg) killed 100% of adult mice. In the old mice the lethal dose was 6 g/kg of taurine coadministered with 6 g/kg of ethanol. All adult and old mice treated with taurine or ethanol alone survived. The adult and old mice treated with ethanol and taurine showed a marked fall in the blood glucose level before their deaths. No changes occurred in the blood glucose level in mice which received only taurine or ethanol. We assume that the drop in blood glucose after the taurine and ethanol co-administration can be one reason of lethality. Comparison of the lethal doses of taurine and ethanol co-administration in 7 day-old, adult and old mice allows us to conclude that the adverse effects of taurine and ethanol combined toxicity is age-dependent. Our present findings are an important warning sign of the interactions of taurine and ethanol and their combined toxic effects, particularly for young people mixing taurine-containing energy drinks with alcohol.

N2  - Objectives: Folic acid (FOL) is concentrated in the fetal circulation by the placenta so that cord levels are higher than maternal levels. FOL is also required for detoxification of formic acid (FA), the toxic metabolite of methanol that has recently been observed in cord blood of infants born to alcohol-using mothers. The objectives of this study were to determine if FOL transport to the fetus is decreased after heavy alcohol exposure and therefore the ability to detoxify FA is compromised. These factors may contribute to deficits observed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Folate was measured in maternal and cord blood from alcohol-abusing mothers and controls. Results: The fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was <1.0 in half of the alcohol-exposed pairs (n=12), whereas all of the controls were >1.0 (n=8). Mean folate in cord samples was lower in alcoholexposed than in the controls (25.83+/-13.58 vs 44.04+/-10.86, p<0.01). There was a significant correlation between the control maternal and cord folate levels (p<0.05) whereas the alcohol group correlation was not significant. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that FOL transport to the fetus is compromised in pregnancies affected by alcohol-abuse. This supports our hypothesis that FA may indeed be a significant contributor in the etiology of FASD, and, that FOL as part of treatment to mitigate its effects needs to be investigated.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which encompass a range of physical, behavioral, learning, emotional and social disturbances. In spite of widespread educational efforts about the dangers of drinking during pregnancy, the incidence of FASD has not diminished and alcohol is now identified as the leading human teratogen. The failure of education to reduce the incidence of FASD makes it important to obtain understanding of the mechanism by which alcohol exposure causes neurodevelopmental damage in order to develop preventative and ameliorative strategies. In addition, successful implementation of a preventative or ameliorative strategy requires early identification of affected individuals. Currently, there is no effective means of identifying affected children during the prenatal period. The now well established sheep model offers some unique advantages in addressing these questions. Current projects investigating possible mechanisms for the alcohol induced neurodevelopment damage seen as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure and the evaluation of potential nutritional intervention strategies will be presented, as well as the use of MRI and ultrasound to develop a set of measurements that can be used as a screening tool to identify affected children.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) refers to specific diagnoses that describe individuals who have physical, mental, behavioral, and learning disabilities as a result of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Chudley et al., 2005). Many children may be affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but may not meet all of the diagnostic criteria for FASD. Individuals with FASD display high rates of secondary disabilities including mental health issues and problems with inappropriate sexual behaviors, school, the law, and substance use (Streissguth et al. 1996). The goal of the current project was to examine secondary disabilities and detailed information on mental health problems among Canadian children with PAE and FASD and how risk and protective factors and different types of services affect these outcomes. We also compared patterns of performance between undiagnosed children with PAE and those diagnosed with FASD. Participants included 72 alcohol-exposed children (aged 6 to 17) and their caregivers: 46 were diagnosed with FASD and 26 did not have an FASD diagnosis but had PAE. Caregivers completed a questionnaire measuring secondary disabilities and risk and protective factors (e.g., exposure to violence/abuse, quality and stability of home, having basic needs met for most of life, diagnosed before age 6) adapted from Streissguth et al. (1996). Caregivers also completed the Services for Children and Adolescents-Parent Interview (SCAPI) which measures service use across ten domains, and the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2) which measures behavioral, emotional, and mental health. Both the FASD and PAE group displayed high rates of many secondary disabilities and at-risk scores on the BASC-2. An older age of assessment was associated with more mental health, behavioral, and adaptive problems on the BASC, and more school problems and inappropriate sexual behaviors. Parenting classes were associated with fewer problems with the law and school. Some other services (medication use, school services, child therapy and respite) were actually associated with worse outcomes, which likely occurred because children with more problems were receiving these services. Finally, there were no differences between children with PAE and FASD in most analyses, indicating that outcomes are quite similar among those with PAE with and without a clinical diagnosis.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), including Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE) resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure has been welldocumented in the Western world. With protective genetics (e.g., ADH2*2) in place, how FASD prevails in Eastern world has not been clear. We aim to report a prevalence study of FASD in East Taiwan. Methods: This study was performed in-school in Hualien County in East Taiwan which includes Taiwanese with ancestor of Chinese Han and aborigines with ancestor of Malaysia descent. From 1996 through 1998, data from 3817 students in 87 schools including 847 students from special schools, between 3 to 15 years old were enrolled. A three-stage evaluation process was used, including stage one: background history collection including birth weight & height, and maternal alcohol- or substance-use history during pregnancy; stage two: pediatric physical and neurological assessment including physical dysmorphism. A total of 3817 students complete the first two stages. Children with positive maternal alcohol consumption history and pre- or post-natal growth delay or facial/body dysmorphic characteristics, received stage three:-developmental or cognitive assessment. All the subjects were reviewed by pediatric geneticists, neurologists and psychologists on the same day. Results: Among participants with reported alcohol exposure during pregnancy, we confirmed seven children (1.83 per 1000 live births, 4 boys and 3 girls) with severe form described in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and fifteen (3.93 per 1000 live births, 9 boys and 6 girls) with alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficit without all facial dysmorphic features. With 300-character space, do you plan to add the numbers in special schools? Children with FAS had smaller head circumstance, lower body weight and lower body height than those with FAE. Also, children with FAS scored lower on intelligence tests than did children with non-FAS FASD. Conclusion: Using active case ascertainment in general schools and special schools, this study reported estimates of the prevalence of FASD in East Taiwan. Although with protective gene in Asian population, a comparable prevalence of FASD in East Taiwan is observed comparable to that of the Western world.

N2  - Children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure show reduced control of isometric (IM) and isotonic (IT) force as well as brain structural abnormalities in regions known to be involved in motor control, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. However, the relationship between regulation of motor force and neuroanatomical impairments has not been explored in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Prior studies have evaluated deficits in force regulation in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, and this study extended those studies by examining regional brain volumes associated with IM and IT force regulation in the same cohort of participants. Children with (ALC=9) and without (CON=7) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, who previously received assessment of force regulation, underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Measures of force regulation previously reported to differ between groups-response accuracy, response variability, and signal complexity-were correlated with regional brain volume after correcting for total intracranial volume; significant correlations were followed-up with multiple regression to control for age. In the ALC group, greater IM signal complexity was associated with smaller volume of the inferior parietal (IP) region, and greater IT response variability was correlated with larger volume of the anterior midbody of the corpus callosum. In the CON group, greater IT response variability and signal complexity was related to larger volumes in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, respectively. Findings provide a link between brain structure and force regulation and suggest altered influences of brain development on force production in alcohol-exposed children. Reductions in brain volume as a result of prenatal exposure to alcohol likely contribute to deficits in regulation of motor force in this clinical population. Force regulation is an important control parameter involved in complex movement, and the continued use of neuroimaging methods will help elucidate the relationships between brain and motor development in children with FASD.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a major, preventable cause of neurobehavioural and cognitive deficits in children. The developing brain is the principal target organ for gestational alcohol exposure. The full spectrum includes several diagnostic subgroups, and is collectively referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). There is a clear need to develop new tools for assessing brain function in the FASD population. Measurement of eye movement control is a powerful tool for assessing cognitive, sensory and motor function. Objective: To utilize standardized psychometric tests and measures of saccadic eye movement control to identify brain dysfunction in children with FASD. Methods: In this multi-centre study, each child completed a battery of psychometric tests and a set of structured saccadic eye movement tasks. The psychometric battery measured executive function, working memory, short-term memory, visuospatial skills, language and math ability. Depending on age, each child completed structured eye movement tasks that assessed sensory motor integration, response inhibition, cognitive flexibility and spatial working memory. Results: Preliminary analysis of both sets of tasks revealed significant differences between children with FASD and typically developing children. In both the pro- and antisaccade tasks, the children with FASD display significantly more hypometric initial saccades, which required a greater number of additional saccades per trial to arrive at the target. Also in the prosaccade task, the accuracy of the saccades were significantly poorer in children with FASD compared to controls. The children with FASD made significantly more direction errors in the antisaccade task. In the memory guided task, the children with FASD made significantly more timing errors, and also exhibited decreased accuracy in the task. Analysis of the data from the psychometric battery has revealed that the children with FASD scored significantly lower on every subtest administered except the NEPSY-II arrows task, a test of visuospatial processing. This result suggests that the deficits in eye movement control cannot be attributed to a general deficit in visuospatial processing capability. Conclusions: This study will provide greater insight into the motor and cognitive domains that are assessed using eye movement tasks, and will generate new knowledge that better defines the relationship between brain injury and behaviour in children with FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis, and this may underlie some of the behavioural and adaptive problems in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol show increased basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond infancy. We have completed a 3-year study on the effects of a strength-based, motor skill development program for children with FASD. Our hypothesis is that improvements in the motor domain will extend to other domains, and affect behaviour and adaptive functioning, possibly through effects on the HPA system. Our objectives were to determine the effect of the program on the HPA system (as indicated by salivary cortisol levels), and to compare cortisol levels of children with FASD to that of control children. Methods: Twenty-seven children (age 6-14 y) participated in an 8-week motor skill development program consisting of 2 x 1.5 hour sessions/week. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 24 children (FASD group) and compared at 4 time points: before, immediately after, 2 months, and 1 year after program completion. Cortisol levels were also compared to 32 control children (C group, no FASD) to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: wake-up, after school, and just before bedtime. Results: Salivary cortisol levels showed significant (p's<0.05) diurnal variation in all children, being higher at wake-up, compared with after school and bedtime, and higher after school compared to bedtime. Cortisol levels did not vary significantly over the 4 time points in the C or FASD groups, indicating that there was no effect of the motor skill program on cortisol levels. When the time points were combined, cortisol levels were significantly higher in the afternoon (p=0.033) and at bedtime (p=0.026), but not at wake-up, in children with FASD, compared with controls. Conclusions: These results indicate that cortisol levels are elevated throughout the day in children with FASD, possible due to increased basal levels and/or an increased response to daily stressors. Importantly, these results indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure has longterm effects on the HPA system in humans, which could increase vulnerability to mental health issues and chronic disease.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with an increased incidence of psychopathology in children and adults. The aim of this study was to determine whether early indicators of affect disturbance are seen in infants exposed prenatally to alcohol. We hypothesized that (1) prenatal alcohol exposure is related to greater infant withdrawal and to alterations in infant temperament; (2) the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on withdrawal and temperament are independent of each other and independent of maternal depression and postnatal maternal alcohol use, and (3) the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on cognitive function at 5 years will be mediated, in part, by affective disturbance in infancy as assessed by withdrawal and temperament. The Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort consists of 159 mothers and infants from the Cape Coloured (mixed race) community in Cape Town, South Africa, a large proportion of whom were exposed to alcohol during gestation. Mothers were interviewed about their alcohol consumption using a timeline follow-back approach to determine frequency and amount of drinking on a day-by-day basis. The Alarm Distress Baby Scale (ADBB) of Guerdeney and Fermanian (2001), which assesses sustained affective withdrawal behaviour, was administered at 6.5 months postpartum, and the mothers were interviewed on the Buss and Plomin (1984) EAS Temperament scale at 13 months. At the 5-year follow-up, the Junior South African Intelligence Scales (IQ) assessment was administered, and the EAS interview was repeated. ADBB withdrawal was associated with reduced activity on the EAS (r = -.29, p < .01) but was not related to emotionality, shyness, or sociability. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with greater ADBB affective withdrawal (r = .30, p < .01) and lower EAS activity (r = -.23, p < .01). These effects were independent of each other, and both remained significant after controlling for postnatal maternal alcohol use and depression. Mediation of the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on 5-year IQ by the ADBB fell just short of statistical significance (Sobel z = -1.34, p = .085), suggesting that affective withdrawal that is already evident in infancy contributes to poorer cognitive function at school entry.

N2  - A key component of this NIAAA-funded study to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in the Western Cape Province of South Africa is to contact women on their first visit to the antenatal clinics for an assessment of drinking levels during their current pregnancy and therefore, the risk for producing a child with an FASD. Antenatal clinics are usually held over four days of each week in different locations in our prevention and comparison communities. Since late 2008 through June 2011, 2,550 women have been contacted and enrolled. Seventy-nine percent of the women were "Coloured" (a proper South African term meaning of mixed racial ancestry), 18% were Black, and 3% were White. Generally, these women were extremely positive and open to the brief intervention about the risks of drinking during their pregnancy. In fact, the women who attend these clinics are used to long periods of waiting, and very little time is actually spent with health care workers. The fact that our staff spent time with these women made the women feel special, and the individual attention given to everyone contributed to the success of these efforts. Two instruments are used to assess the use or abuse of alcohol, the Alcohol Use Questionnaire (AUDIT), and the Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ). After completing the assessment tools, any risky drinking behavior was discussed with the women in a non-judgmental manner, and every woman was motivated by receiving factual, prevention information and informed that stopping drinking at any time during the pregnancy would benefit their baby. In the prevention community, if a woman was consuming alcohol in a risky manner, our staff member invited the women to become involved in the case management component of our study. Women in the comparison communities are referred to Provincial health officials or non-governmental organizations. Data analysis continues.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are caused by the deleterious effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. FASD's are the most common environmentally induced form of mental retardation in the world, potentially affecting 1% of all children born in the United States. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most clinically recognizable form of FASD and is characterized by a pattern of minor facial anomalies, prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, and functional or structural central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. However, the effects of alcohol on the developing fetus represent a continuum, with full-blown FAS merely the "tip of the iceberg." The highest documented prevalence of FAS in the world has been documented to be 80 per 1,000 in the mixed race population of the Western Cape Province in South Africa. The consequences of FASD are life long, and the behavioral and learning difficulties are often greater than the degree of neurocognitive impairment. Thus, early diagnosis and referral for early intervention services is imperative. However, while application of diagnostic guidelines for FASD in older children and adolescents can be difficult, diagnosis in the infant is rarely attempted because of the lack of documented specificity of the phenotype in the newborn. Yet, identification and referral within the first few months of life may represent the most crucial time in the affected child's lifespan for initiation of early intervention services. Between October 2008 and May 2011 NIAAA-funded researchers investigated predictors of FASD and developmental outcome in early infancy in a cohort of 965 alcohol-exposed and unexposed infants prospectively ascertained during pregnancy. We utilized three methodologies to approach this issue: growth and standardized dysmorphology assessment of subjects and controls at birth, 6 weeks, 9 months and 18 month intervals, respectively; standardized developmental assessments (using age appropriate assessment tools) at the same intervals; and digital photography at each interval.

N2  - Purpose: The Hawai'i Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Task Force was initiated less than a decade ago as a primary entity to help plan, guide, facilitate, and oversee statewide initiatives in the education and awareness, screening, identification, prevention, interventions, and services related to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. An historical assessment of the Task Force activities was conducted to map the challenges and progress made in the goal of building a comprehensive statewide system for FASD. Method: Archived documents from the Task Force and the Hawai'i Department of Health were examined, (e.g., PRAMS and Birth Defects Reports), and informal face-to-face or phone interviews were conducted (e.g., State FASD Coordinator, other agency collaborators). These sources provided quantitative and qualitative information about the Task Force's planned or prioritized, and implemented activities, as well as the major outcomes, challenges, and successes. Results: Though an iterative process, the Task Force has conducted needs assessments, strategic planning, and prioritized inter-agency and multi-sectoral collaborative activities, reflecting incremental gains in expanding initiatives in prevention, screening, public awareness, and education and training over time. The creation of a State FASD Coordinator position within the past several years was significant in catalyzing increased and sustained support for FASD initiatives and extending collaborative networks with national experts/teams, community-based organizations, and other local agencies to leverage resources in a time of economic strain. Needs assessments by the state and other community data indicate that prenatal alcohol use is significant, and that health, educational, and social services seek education and training opportunities to address the issues of FASDs in practice. Recent efforts have looked to develop or enhance foundations in a systematic and collaborative approach for currently challenging areas such as data and surveillance, research, and education and training to help improve screening, identification and prevention systems. Conclusion: A strategic and informed approach to building a statewide comprehensive system can become an iterative and resource-dependent process. Key leadership, stakeholder commitment and support, and prioritization by the state is essential in order to continue to make progress and drive policy directions to reduce and prevent FASDs in Hawai'i.

N2  - South Africa has the highest recorded prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in the world. Caused by maternal drinking, FAS is preventable and characterized by unique facial features, growth retardation, and developmental delays. Case management (CM) can help women access resources needed to reduce drinking or increase abstention from alcohol during pregnancy. In this study, CM is designed to determine whether the rate of FASD can be reduced over time, focusing on indicated prevention to provide support to women who are known to drink heavily during pregnancy. CM was implemented by trained project officers using Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) techniques to encourage positive changes in drinking habits. MI is a person-centred therapy that elicits and strengthens motivation for change. CRA is an evidence-based behavioral approach for treating substance abuse problems to assist clients in maintaining a sober lifestyle. Data for the initial participants (n = 30; 97% Coloured, 3% Black) indicated risk factors commonly associated with maternal drinking and FASD, including young age at time of pregnancy (= 24.3 years), low education (= < 8th grade), low religiousity (> 33% report never attending church), and unemployment (>75% do not work for money). The majority (69%) of the sample report that half or more of their current friends drink alcohol. Ninety percent believed they were pregnant at the time of intake. Nearly half (48%) report their lives to be very or extremely stressful, and at intake, nearly half (42% a very high percentage in this South African population) believed they currently had a drinking problem. Mean AUDIT scores show significant improvement from baseline to 6 month follow-up (20.3 down to 9.7). Measures for total drinks consumed on weekends, total drinks over the past seven days, and total number of drinking days in the past week, were also reduced. Results show the efficacy of CM, while also showing the difficulty of making enduring change in an environment where weekend drinking for recreation and sociability remains popular. CM for prevention is useful to help women abstain or reduce their alcohol intake during pregnancy. Data gathering and analysis continues.

N2  - In general, females in Asian countries consume less alcohol than those from Western countries although alcohol consumption among females in Korea have been increasing. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a serious consequence of drinking during pregnancy and little information is available on the rates of FAS in Asian countries. This study estimated the prevalence of FAS in South Korea using an active case ascertainment approach in two different settings, general schools (N=12) and institutions for children with intellectual disability (N=8). Within the general schools 7,785 children were screened on height and weight and those falling under the 10th percentile were selected for subsequent physical examination (n=224), including a dysmorphology assessment. Intellectual function and attention capabilities were examined by utilizing a standardized neurocognitive test, WISC-III(Wechsler Inteligence Scale for Children, 3th ed.)and computerized continuous performance test. Parental interviews were conducted to obtain information about maternal drinking history. In the institutional settings, physical exams, including the dysmorphology assessment were performed on all children. In the general schools the prevalence of FAS was 0.28%, whereas in the institutions for intellectual disability the prevalence was 14.9%. These rates are not dissimilar to those reported in western countries. These data extend extremely limited studies on the prevalence of FAS in S. Korea and demonstrate the need for increased screening and diagnoses of FAS in various community and clinical settings.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can significantly damage the developing brain. Because the exact nature of the damage can depend upon the amount consumed, and the time it is consumed during the pregnancy, the damage can manifest in wide array of disorders that are grouped under the term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). One problem consistently observed in FASD is an impairment in learning and memory processes, particularly those that involve the functioning of the hippocampal formation. Experimentally we can study deficits caused by FASD by looking at long-term potentiation (LTP), a biological model of learning and memory that is easily observed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In this study we have observed deficits in LTP in anaesthetized adult males that have been exposed to alcohol prenatally. Biochemical analyses of the brains of these animals revealed that these deficits in LTP were also accompanied by reductions in neuronal antioxidants; in particular glutathione. To try and ameliorate the deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, we gave animals' access to a diet supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for membrane fluidity and participate in many signaling cascades in the brain. They are also associated with preventing neurocognitive decline, decreasing inflammation, and reducing indications of depression. In the present study we show that Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in FASD newborns completely rescues deficits in LTP and increases glutathione levels into adulthood. Furthermore, glutathione depletion itself can mimic the effects of FASD for LTP, indicating that a reduction in glutathione alone can significantly impair the functional capacity of synapses. These results indicate that omega-3 fatty acids may be an important addition to the diet of children suffering from FASD and may be able to "rescue" the deficits in learning and memory common with this disorder.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol has been linked to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) which encompasses various developmental deficits, including cardinal brain retardation. Although many mechanisms (e. g. oxidative stress, apoptosis) have been studied, how alcohol leads to neurodevelopmental disorders remains elusive. We have recently proposed that alcohol, acting as a methyl donor suppressor, interferes with DNA methylation, which we have further demonstrated to play a permissive role during neural tube differentiation. This study aims to examine the role of the DNA methylation in cerebellar development and the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure. Using a mouse model of prenatal alcohol exposure (liquid, 4% v/v, administered across gestational period E7-17, pups reared by surrogate foster mothers) as well as isocaloric pair-fed and control animals, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of the DNA methylation marker 5-methylcytosine (5meC) and a recently identified derivative, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) across critical periods of postnatal cerebellar development (P7, P21, P28). We observed that the methylation of two major classes of cells, Purkinje and granule, are unique and transition through methylation and de-methylation states across development. Additionally, subpopulations of granule cells exhibit distinct DNA Methylation Programs, or DMPs, relative to their mitotic and migrational status (P7). Alcohol has been previously shown to delay migration of granule cells from the external layer to their internal layer position. The results of our alcohol treatment further show that granule cell DMP is concordantly hindered. Taken together our study concludes that the DMP of the cerebellum is timely and cell-specific and can be altered by moderate fetal alcohol exposure. Further, this study suggests a novel mechanism for the inhibited migration of granule cells of the cerebellum upon fetal alcohol exposure and provides support for the idea that alcohol can exploit epigenetic machinery to alter transcriptional regulation during neurodevelopment-a focus of our forthcoming work.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are characterized by attention deficits. The current study examined the nature and specificity of these deficits by comparing performance of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) to non-exposed controls using a measure based on a strong theoretical model of attention functioning (e.g., Posner et al., 2006). Methods: Subjects (8-12y, M=10.99) comprised two groups: children with AE (N=27) and typically developing controls (CON, N=26). Groups were matched on age, sex, handedness, race/ethnicity, and SES. Subjects were administered the attention network test, a computerized task that examines three independent but interrelated networks of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Data were analyzed using a 2 (group) x 3 (network) repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Results indicate that children with AE were impaired on alerting and executive control aspects of attention. Omnibus tests revealed significant main effects of network (F (2,102) = 12.89, p < .001) and a network X group interaction (F (2,102)= 3.89, p = .024). The main effect of group was not significant (F (1,51) = 0.28, p = .560). Pairwise comparisons indicated that the AE group was significantly worse on alerting (p = .035) and marginally worse on executive control (p = .052) networks than the CON group. There were no group differences on orienting attention in this sample (p = .821). In addition, as a preliminary investigation, a small group of subjects with ADHD were tested and compared to children with AE. These limited data suggest that the two clinical groups can be differentiated on executive control of attention (p = .050) but were similar on the orienting and alerting networks. Conclusion: Findings suggest that children with AE are impaired in distinct aspects of attention function. Specifically, children with AE show impairment in alerting and executive control attention networks. Evaluation of underlying mechanisms of attention allows for greater understanding of brain regions affected by AE and suggests that areas in the frontal and parietal cortical sites (alerting) and areas in the cingulate gyrus and some lateral prefrontal areas (executive control) might be especially affected in these children.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are characterized by attention deficits. The current study examined the nature and specificity of these deficits by comparing neural activation of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) to non-exposed controls during a measure based on a strong theoretical model of attention functioning (e.g., Posner et al., 2006). Method: Subjects (13-16y, M=15.10) comprised two groups: children with AE (N=24) and typically developing controls (CON, N=9). Groups were matched on age, sex, handedness, race/ethnicity, and SES. During fMRI, subjects were administered the attention network test, a computerized task that examines three independent but interrelated networks of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Data were analyzed using independent sample ttests. Results: Groups did not differ on task accuracy; however, the CON had overall faster reaction times compared to the AE group (p < .05). Statistically significant group differences in BOLD response were observed in all three attention networks (cluster size > 1,000 microl; p < .05). In the alerting network, the CON group showed greater BOLD response than the AE group in the bilateral superior/middle and inferior temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and left postcentral gyrus, whereas, the AE group showed greater BOLD response in regions of the medial frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and right paracentral lobule. In the orienting network, the AE group had greater activation mainly in areas of the inferior and middle frontal gyri and the middle temporal gyrus. During the executive network condition the CON group had greater activation in parietal regions, while children in the AE group showed greater activation in the cuneus, posterior cingulate, superior and middle temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Conclusions: Results support prior findings suggesting that attention may be particularly sensitive to the teratogenic effects of AE and further indicate that distinct neural mechanisms underlie the attention network in children with AE compared to nonexposed typically developing peers. In the majority of the clusters, children in AE group showed greater activation, which may result from atypical neuroadaptive processes or brain alterations.

N2  - Verbal and visuospatial learning and memory have been extensively studied in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Previous studies have shown deficits in learning in both domains. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamics of verbal and visuospatial learning in children with FASD from Cape Town, South Africa. The sample was comprised of 59 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) children who are participating in the 9-year follow-up of a longitudinal FASD study, comprised of children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (PFAS), heavy exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children, and controls. Children were administered a visuospatial associative learning test and the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), a test of episodic learning. Learning rates were estimated by fitting negatively accelerated response functions (y=1-e-kx) to each child's performance across trials on each learning task. Significant differences in learning rate were found on the CVLT-C [F(2, 51) = 5.03; p < .01] with those in the FAS/PFAS and HE groups showing slower learning rates than controls (both ps < .05). A marginally significant difference in learning rate was found on the visuospatial associative learning task [F(2, 49) = 3.01; p = .059] with those in the FAS/PFAS group having slower learning rates than the HE group (p < .05). Significant differences in peak performance (capacity) were found on the CVLT-C [F(2, 51) = 5.83; p < .01] with those in the FAS/PFAS and HE groups showing less learning capacity than controls (both ps < .05). No exposure group differences in capacity were found on the visuospatial associative learning task [F(2,49) = 0.15; n.s.]. These data indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure affects learning rates similarly in both tasks, but only episodic learning capacity is vulnerable, while associative learning is spared. The finding of deficits in learning rates in both tasks suggests a non-specific impairment in information processing and integration related to prenatal alcohol exposure. The finding that capacity was affected on the episodic recall task suggests that fetal alcohol exposure may affect the interaction of hippocampal and frontal regions, which is necessary for episodic recall. No capacity deficits were found on the associative learning task, which is primarily dependent on hippocampal activity alone.

N2  - Cognitive impairment in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is most severe in children who meet diagnostic criteria for full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), but significant deficits are also seen in non-syndromal heavily-exposed (HE) children. Using fMRI, we recently found differences in working memory-related cortico-striatal-cerebellar activation between syndromal and non-syndromal alcohol-exposed children (Diwadkar et al., 2012). But effects on regional brain interactions have not previously been investigated in FASD. In this study, we used psycho-physiological interaction (Friston et al., 1997), a seed-based method for assessing modulatory interactions between brain regions. We hypothesized that prenatal alcohol exposure would affect the degree to which the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), an important cognitive control region, modulates activity in fronto-striatal-cerebellar regions known to mediate working memory. A verbal 1-back task was administered to 47 children (17 with FAS/PFAS, 13 HE, and 17 controls; age 8.9-10.6 yr). In the 1-back condition, the child presses the left key if the letter appearing on the screen is the same as the previous letter; the right key, if it is not. In 0-back, s/he presses the left key to the letter D; otherwise, the right. Time series from the dACC (p<.05, effects of interest) were convolved with the psychological contrast of interest (1-back > 0-back) to investigate modulatory effects of the dACC. Inter-group differences were evaluated in a second level analysis of variance. When compared with controls, the FAS/PFAS group showed significantly greater modulation by the dACC of several brain regions known to mediate working memory, including dorsal prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Similar, albeit somewhat weaker, effects were seen in the HE group. These data suggest that fetal alcohol exposure disrupts the efficiency of cortico-striatal-cerebellar function, so that greater modulation by a key executive control region is required to perform a simple 1-back task. This increased executive control may constitute a compensatory mechanism for functional deficits in the regions that mediate working memory.

N2  - The idea that exposure to adverse environmental conditions and lifestyle choices during pregnancy can result in fetal programming that underlies disease susceptibility in adulthood is now widely accepted. One area that has not been well studied is the impact of maternal alcohol abuse on the offspring's susceptibility to cancer. We have recently shown that fetal alcohol exposure altered mammary gland morphology with a characteristic of the hyperproliferative state prior to puberty. When fetal alcohol exposed rats were treated with a carcinogen, they showed a higher incidence of mammary tumors and progressed more frequently to a malignant phenotype. We hypothesized that higher cancer incidence in fetal alcohol exposed offspring might be a result of an abnormality in the physiological process(s) that prevents cancer development. It has been suggested that the effect of stress on the immune system may in turn affect the growth of some tumors. We have previously shown that a set of hormone secreting nerve cells in the hypothalamus, called beta-endorphin (BEP) neurons, plays a role in regulating stress response and immune function. Hence, we tested whether fetal alcohol exposure increases the incidence of tumor colonization of a breast adenocarcinoma cell line, and whether transplantation of BEP neurons affects tumor colonization in these fetal alcohol exposed rats. Pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats were fed with rat chow (Ad Lib), alcohol containing diet (Alcohol-fed), or an isocaloric liquid diet (Pair-fed). Their female offspring were transplanted with either BEP neurons or cortical cells as control. They were then inoculated with MADB106 cells in the jugular vein. Animals were sacrificed 4 weeks later and tumor granules in the lungs were counted. After tumor inoculation, fetal alcohol exposed rat had more tumor colonization in the lung comparing to ad lib and pair-fed animals. BEP transplantation reduced the stress hormone level of fetal alcohol exposed rats, and significantly prevented the appearance of tumor granules in the lung of control animals as well as fetal alcohol exposed animals. These data can be interpreted as preliminary evidence that a loss of BEP control of cancer cell clearance may be a cause for the increased cancer susceptibility in fetal alcohol animals. Furthermore, the data identify the potential use of BEP cell therapy for breast cancer prevention.

N2  - Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, one of the major regulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, immune functions and energy homeostasis, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of fetal alcohol exposure. This vulnerability is manifested by hypermethylation of POMC gene promoter with a deficit in POMC gene expression and a decrease in protein levels of its derived opioid peptide beta-endorphin. We previously demonstrated that fetal alcohol exposure significantly decreased the protein levels of the activation mark H3K4me3 and increased the protein levels of the repressive mark H3K9me2 in beta-endorphin-producing POMC neurons. In this study, we specifically investigated if this deficit in gene expression and beta-endorphin peptide production is also mediated by modulation of histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 along POMC gene in fetal alcohol exposed offspring. The spatial distribution of histone marks along a gene body plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and gene expression. We found by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) that fetal alcohol exposure from gestational days GD7- GD21 decreased in exposed male and female adult rats the occupancy of H3K4me3 along Exon 3 of POMC gene. Although the level of H3K9me2 was higher in alcohol exposed rats compared to controls, the occupancy of this mark was low and did not change significantly along Exon 3 or along POMC gene promoter in control and treated rats. Interestingly, the occupancy of the mutually exclusive histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 changed in opposite direction as expected along Exon 3 of POMC gene. Overall, this study shows a distinctive spatial distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 along POMC gene that reflects the modulation of POMC chromatin landscape in response to prenatal alcohol exposure. The reduction of H3K4me3 along Exon 3 of POMC gene could modulate the efficiency of Exon 3 splicing. This could be one of the causes of the decrease in generation of functional POMC transcripts and in production of functional beta-endorphin peptides from hypothalamic POMC gene.

N2  - Purpose: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine annual trends in the prevalence of any alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant and non-pregnant women aged 18-44 between 2006 and 2010. Additionally, patterns of binge episodes and maximum alcoholic beverages consumed on a single occasion were explored. Methods: Five years of data, collected from 2006 through 2010, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were combined and analyzed. The study population included 13,880 pregnant and 331,196 non-pregnant women aged 18-44. Annual and fiveyear prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking (defined as four or more drinks on one occasion) in the past 30 days were calculated for pregnant and non-pregnant women. The average number of binge drinking episodes and the average maximum number of drinks consumed on one occasion in the past 30 days among binge drinkers were also estimated. Results: The estimated prevalence of any alcohol use from 2006-2010 among pregnant women and non-pregnant women was 7.6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 6.9-8.4) and 51.5% (95% CI = 51.2-51.8), respectively. The estimated prevalence of binge drinking from 2006-2010 among pregnant women and non-pregnant women was 1.1% (95% CI = 0.8-1.4) and 13.5% (95% CI = 13.2-13.7), respectively. There was little annual change in either set of prevalence estimates over the five years of data collection. The reported average number of binge drinking episodes was only slightly lower among pregnant women compared to nonpregnant women (2.5 vs. 3.0, respectively). The average maximum number of alcoholic beverages consumed on one occasion was found to be 6.2 drinks among both pregnant and non-pregnant women who binge. Conclusion: The relatively stable prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking from 2006 to 2010 among women of childbearing age indicate that continued efforts are necessary to address this public health concern and further reduce FASD risk. Women who binge drink appear to binge with similar frequency and intensity, regardless of pregnancy status. Women who binge drink are an important population for targeted interventions. Increasing screening and brief intervention may help to address this issue.

N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy causes to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), with varying degrees of neurodevelopment deficits. Proper DNA methylation which regulates gene repression is now known as a prerequisite for zygote differentiation, early development, tissue specification. We previously reported that DNA methylation is a program (DMP) which parallel to embryonic maturation during early neural tube development, and, alcohol exposure delayed this DMP along with retarded embryonic growth. To further understanding the methyl binding protein which connection between DNA methylation and gene expression in DMP, we studied the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 (MBD1). To mimic similar patterns of brain damage known to occur when pregnant women drink alcohol in chronic and in binge drinking pattern, we employed Liquid Diet [LD; 4% v/v alcohol on gestational (E) days 7 to E17; BAC 100-200mg/dL, analyzed at E17] and Vapor Chamber (VC, 6hrs of 300mg/dL beginning at E8 and harvest at E10) model of alcohol administration. Alcohol in LD paradigm, reduced the brain weights on E17, and markedly delayed the hippocampus development and a significant reduction in cortex thickness. In the VC model, alcohol caused embryonic growth retardation as indicated by Van Farber scoring system. Through immunostaining, we found that the MeCP2 and MBD1 exhibited reversed expression patterns. As compared to controls, a marked increase of immunointensity and number of MeCP2+ cells, while a significant decrease in immunointensity and number of MBD1+ cells were found in the developing hippocampal and migratory cortical areas. A similar finding was observed in VC binge model showing the marked increase of MeCP2 and decrease of MBD1 in the fore- and hindbrain regions of telencephalic wall, optic and otic vesicles, and first branchial arch in the alcohol treated E10 embryos. Through both chronic and binge models, we showed for the first time that alcohol-induced a contrast change of MeCP2 and MBD1 which correlated with neural developmental delay. This finding strongly supports our previous observation on alcohol disrupted DMP. Furthermore, since MeCP2 and MBD1 are functioning in mediate the DNA methylation to gene repression, the consequence of their alteration further signifies the altered DMP hypothesis on alcohol induced neurodevelopment deficit.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defect and neurobehavioral disorders in humans. In the most severe cases, these abnormalities make up a pattern of malformations termed fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). This syndrome is associated with high prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and hearing disorders in neonates and children. Thus, alcohol exposure in utero is a potential factor for the etiology and mechanisms of enhanced seizure susceptibility in neonates with FAS. Evidence indicates that rodent subjected to gestational alcohol exposure exhibit altered auditory brainstem responses, which lasted into adulthood. The inferior colliculus (IC), the generator of auditory brainstem responses wave V, plays a critical role in the initiation of tonic-clonic seizures following alcohol withdrawal. Thus, alcohol-induced changes in IC neuronal excitability may contribute to the mechanisms of enhanced seizure susceptibility associated with FAS. Here, we examined the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on firing and voltageactivated Ca2+ channel (Cav) currents in dissociated IC neurons obtained from neonatal rat offspring (P3-P7). Pregnant rats received a single dose of 5 g/kg body weight ethanol (95%) as a 30% (v/v) solution in Isomil by gastric intubation at gestational day 18. Control animals received only Isomil. IC neurons were recorded in whole cell patch clamp configuration for current- and voltage-clamp experiments. Cav currents were measured using 5 mM Ca2+. Quantification shows that prenatal alcohol exposure elicits the occurrence of >2 action potentials (APs) evoked by depolarizing current injections. Such elevated responses were not seen in control IC neurons which only exhibited a single AP. Increasing extracellular (from 2 mM to 5 mM) Ca2+ concentration reversibly enhanced the number of APs in control IC neurons. Quantification also shows that Cav current density was significantly elevated in IC neurons following prenatal alcohol exposure. Pharmacological analysis reveals that Cav1.2/ Cav1.3 and Cav2.3 contribute to the enhanced current density in neonatal IC neurons following prenatal alcohol exposure. These findings suggested that altered Cav1.2/Cav1.3 and Cav2.3 signaling may play important roles in the pathophysiology of FAS-associated diseases of neuronal excitability.

N2  - The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code is a rigorous FASD diagnostic protocol based on measurements of growth, face, brain damage, and prenatal alcohol exposure (Astley, 2004). To date only one study in Washington is known to describe the characteristics of persons screened for FASD based on the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code criteria (Astley, 2010). This paper provides comparative data to begin to explore the validity and discuss the consistency of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code criteria by examining 863 cases from Minnesota. Five Minnesota clinics were involved in the data collection efforts related to the FASD screening. Two clinics were in Minneapolis, two in northern Minnesota and one was in the southeast region of the state. The data are based on chart reviews of patients who were screened for FASD in 2001 to 2003. Prior to this study two of the five clinics were involved in the diagnosis of FASD. The other three clinics received training from staff at the University of Minnesota and the University of Washington. The sample included 863 persons who had been referred to one of five Minnesota FASD diagnostic clinics. Most of the 863 cases (795; 92.4%) were 18 years or younger and confirmed to be born in the United States (662; 76.7%). The cases were predominately white (44.0%) and non- Hispanic (98.5%). Of those cases where the mothers' age at birth was known (55.4%), almost half of the participants were born to mothers who were 25 years or younger at the time of the birth. 164 (19.0%) of the cases were diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome [FAS/PFAS], 295 (34.3%) with static encephalopathy [SE], and 174 (20.2%) with neurodevelopmental disorder [ND]. Of the remaining cases, 30 (3.5%) did not receive a FASD related diagnosis and 197 (22.8%) did not fall within the four digit code diagnostic area; and 135 had the unknown history of alcohol exposure [AE]. Examination of comorbidity by diagnostic status revealed significant differences in the distribution of ADHD, conduct disorder/ODD, learning disorders, mental retardation, and anxiety disorder by FASD diagnosis. In general FAS/PFAS and Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed diagnoses had the greater prevalence of these four additional diagnoses. This report documents the characteristics of person screened for FASD using the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. Future comparative studies across states (e.g., Minnesota and Washington) should be pursued to further validate the diagnostic tool.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) persists as a major public health concern. Confidence in diagnosis for "non-FAS" FASD is limited by the absence of facial features and by variable neurobehavioral effects. Our goal is to identify an "epigenetic" profile as a pattern of DNA methylation in infant blood that is a valid biomarker of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a sensitive predictor of neurobehavioral outcomes that together may aid in early detection and diagnosis of FASD. Methods. Subjects from a large prospective pregnant African American cohort with assessments of maternal alcohol use beginning at the first antenatal visit were selected based on our validated metric of prenatal "at-risk alcohol exposure" (Chiodo et al., 2009) and available subsequent neurobehavioral assessment. With maternal consent, infant heel-stick "blood spots" were obtained from the Michigan Neonatal BioBank archive for 5 at-risk PAE infants and 7 non-exposed infant controls. DNA was extracted, subjected to bisulfite conversion, hybridized to an Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, fluorescent stained, scanned, and whole-genome CpG methylation status for >27,000 sites determined. Differentially methylated sites were filtered with a cut-point at p<0.01. Results. At-risk PAE was associated with a set of significantly hypermethylated DNA sites in dried infant blood. Among the 50 most differentially methylated sites, all 5 PAE infants had 9 to 15 to hypermethylated sites whereas 5 of 7 non-exposed infants had zero. The other two non-exposed controls had only 2 or 3 (chi2=12.0, p=.007). No sites were significantly hypomethylated after PAE. The degrees of DNA hypermethylation in many of these same sites were correlated significantly with memory, behavior and fine motor problems (but few with birth weight or IQ) in these children at 4 years of age. DNA hypermethylation was also related to other measures of risk drinking (e.g., average amount of alcohol drunk per drinking day across pregnancy & the TACER-3 screen). Conclusions. Differential patterns of DNA methylation (or "epigenetic marks") in blood may effectively detect infants exposed to at-risk maternal drinking and predict life-long FASD. Other predictors, factors, genes or outcomes, as well as potential 'mechanisms of pathology' that may be indicated by which genes are altered, all remain to be determined in future analyses.

N2  - Identification of the newborn infants exposed to alcohol in utero is essential to establishing early intervention strategies. Previous studies have shown that fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), non-oxidative metabolites of alcohol, in meconium are potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure in term newborns. However, the identification of specific FAEEs and threshold concentrations of FAEEs which correlate with exposure remains under investigation. The aim of this study was to evaluate FAEEs in the meconium of infants and identify a concentration and pattern of FAEEs to serve as accurate biomarkers of in utero ETOH exposure. Pregnant women were recruited from the University of New Mexico substance abuse clinic during one of the first prenatal care visits and categorized into: a) alcohol-exposed (>1 binge episode or >3 drinks/wk on average since the last menstrual period [LMP]); and b) controls (alcohol abstainers since LMP). FAEEs were measured in the meconium of 38 infants born to cohort participants (12 exposed and 26 controls). Meconium was extracted and analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The data (ng of FAEEs/g of meconium) was not normally distributed and was therefore log-transformed and analyzed via the Mann-Whitney U test. Cut off analysis was performed using Chi-Square. FAEEs were detectable in all meconium samples. Concentrations of Stearic FAEE were elevated in alcohol-exposed infants compared to non-exposed infants (p=0.058). The set threshold of significance for the amount of FAEEs (specifically Linoleic and Linolenic) was set as greater than 10,000 ng/g of meconium. The observed difference in quantity of Linoleic and Linolenic FAEEs (ng/g of meconium sample) in control vs exposed infants could potentially trend towards significance with a larger sample number [11.5% of control infants vs. 41.6% of alcohol-exposed infants (p=0.08)]. Based on these results, infants exposed to alcohol in utero (based on maternal report) trended towards higher concentrations of Stearic in their meconium compared to control infants and they had four-fold elevated levels of Linoleic+ Linolenic ethyl esters compared to non-exposed newborns. While other investigators have shown that one FAEE (i.e. Linoleic ethyl ester) is found in higher concentrations in alcohol-exposed newborns, we have shown that a combination of FAEEs at certain threshold values holds further promise for more accurate identification of the alcohol-exposed newborns.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability. The mechanisms underlying FASD are incompletely understood, and biomarkers to identify those at risk are lacking. Here, we detail the metabolomic analysis of embryoid bodies and neural lineages derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cell, and we identify the neural secretome produced in response to ethanol exposure. Methods: WA01 and WA09 hES cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies, neural progenitors or neurons. Cells along this progression were cultured for four days with 0%, 0.1% or 0.3% ethanol. Supernatants from the last 24hr of culture were subjected to C18 chromatography followed by ESI-QTOF-MS. Features were annotated using public databases and the identities of four putative biomarkers were confirmed with purified standards and comparative MS/MS. Results: Ethanol treatment induced statistically significant changes to metabolite abundance in human embryoid bodies (180 features), neural progenitors (76 features) and neurons (42 features). There were no shared significant features between different cell types. Fifteen features showed a dose-response to ethanol. Four chemical identities were confirmed; Lthyroxine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, and the tryptophan metabolites L-kynurenine, and indoleacetaldehyde. One feature with a putative annotation of succinyladenosine was significantly increased in both ethanol treatments. Additional features were selective to ethanol treatment but were not annotated in public databases. Conclusions: Ethanol exposure induces statistically significant changes to the metabolome profile of human embryoid bodies, neural progenitors and neurons. Several of these metabolites are normally present in human serum, suggesting their usefulness as potential serum FASD biomarkers. These findings suggest the biochemical pathways that are affected by ethanol in the developing nervous system and delineate mechanisms of alcohol injury during human development.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol abuse causes important structural and functional brain defects and is the leading cause of preventable retardation in the United States. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a broad term used to describe individuals exposed prenatally to alcohol and encompasses a broad range of birth defects including facial abnormalities and learning, motor, and behavioral deficits. Despite promoting alcohol abstinence during pregnancy, the incidence of FASD has failed to decline and individuals lacking cardinal facial abnormalities and historical exposure are increasingly difficult to identify. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is readily available, provides superior brain contrast, and in previous human studies of FASD has shown significant volume reductions in various brain structures. We hypothesize that postnatal MRI derived volumetric brain measurements can predict prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant ewes received 2.5 g/kg alcohol (N = 5) IV three consecutive days per week from gestation day 4-41 (mimicking a binge drinking pattern in the first trimester of pregnancy) while remaining ewes were controls (N = 5). Lambs were sacrificed at 5 months of age, their brains were perfused with fixative, and MRI's were performed immediately post mortem.T1-weighted images were used to calculate cerebellar volume (Inveon Research Workplace software, Siemens). Mean cerebellar volume in controls (10,655.02 +/- 943.51mm3) did not significantly differ from the alcohol group (10,519.18 +/- 181.87 mm3) (p = .891). These MRI findings are consistent with a our previous work utilizing stereological methods on the fetal cerebellum and the same first trimester alcohol exposure. The total estimated cerebellar Purkinje cell number and Purkinje cell density decreased significantly in the alcohol group compared to the control group but no significant differences existed between cerebellar volumes. Cerebellar volume is therefore a poor predictor of first trimester alcohol exposure at this alcohol dose and pattern in sheep, but MRI derived volumetric measures of other brain structures may be beneficial and further studies are warranted. Supported by Texas A&M CVM Post Doctoral Grant (SB) and NIAAA Grant AA0171290 (TAC). All or part of this work was done in conjunction with the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), which is funded by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA).

N2  - We have reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy alters placental expression of genes associated with nervous and vascular system development. Gonzalez and colleagues have shown that daily injections of 3 g/kg ethanol in mouse dams (maternal serum ethanol concentration of ~200 mg/dL) causes striking distortions in the density and radial orientation of the cerebral cortical microvascular network in PD2-old offspring. The present study addressed two questions: 1) Does moderate maternal drinking during pregnancy alter the expression of fetal cortical genes associated with neural and vascular development in a manner similar to the changes previously observed in placenta, and 2) does more moderate ethanol exposure affect fetal cortical microvascular development? Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0% or 5% ethanol solution in 0.066% saccharin water for four hours each day throughout gestation. The mean daily ethanol consumption of 2.72 g/kg, which produces a peak maternal SEC of 84 mg/dL, did not affect maternal weight gain, litter size or birth weight. On GD20, rat placental:fetal units were removed by Caesarian section and both placenta and cerebral cortex were processed for mRNA expression array analysis. In addition, fetal frontal cortices were evaluated for vascular density in the cortical plate (CP), intermediate zone (IZ), and ventricular zone (VZ) layers. Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) significantly altered the expression of 686 genes in fetal cortex and 529 genes in placenta. Gene ontology analyses revealed a significant enrichment in genes associated with neural and vascular development in both tissue types from ethanol-exposed offspring. Ethanol exposure decreased vascular density in all three layers of cerebral cortex. The reduction was statistically significant in the ventricular zone. No changes in the radial orientation of the microvascular were observed. These results indicate that moderate levels of fetal ethanol exposure affect both the expression of genes associated with vascular development as well as the microvasculature in the developing cortex. Our data suggest that further investigation of the connection between cerebral microvascular development and neural development is warranted to uncover mechanisms of fetal alcohol-induced damage.

N2  - Introduction. Most children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy cannot be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We are investigating whether alterations in placental gene and protein expression at term may provide a reliable and sensitive diagnostic indicator of fetal alcohol exposure as well as a prognostic indicator of risk for functional brain damage leading to adverse neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes in affected offspring. We previously reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy differentially affects placental genes, including those coding for proteins associated with nervous, vascular and immune system development. In the current study, we used a combination of proteomic analyses and western blotting to confirm the identification of proteins altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy. Methods. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were assigned to one of two experimental groups. One group consumed a 5% ethanol solution (in 0.066% saccharin water) four hours each day throughout gestation, resulting in a mean maternal peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. A control group consumed a matched volume of saccharin water. At term (Gestational Day 20) placentas were harvested, saline-perfused to remove blood from the tissue, and processed for analysis of protein expression. Results. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis of placental tissue detected 1181 protein spots, twenty of which were significantly altered by maternal drinking during pregnancy. Fourteen of the altered protein spots have been identified via mass spectroscopic analysis. Some of the identified proteins play critical roles in placental and neural development, angiogenesis or apoptosis. Recently, western blotting has confirmed the ethanol-induced alterations for two of the identified proteins, namely, Annexin IV and Cerebral Cavernous Malformation Protein 3. Conclusions. These results indicate that placental proteins associated with vascular remodeling are altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy and could serve as biomarker candidates for fetal ethanol exposure and fetal ethanol effects. Further, these results provide insights on novel mechanisms of how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function.

N2  - Introduction: Craniofacial bone dysmorphology is an important but under explored diagnostic feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study aims to examine effects of dose and timing of fetal alcohol exposure on a set of craniofacial bones in a mouse model, while co-varying for the head size variation. Methods: C57BL/6J dams were randomly assigned into three different alcohol treatment groups representing two doses (high vs. low) and two timings (long vs. short) at postpregnancy: a 10-day exposure from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E16 on either 4.2% v/v (high dose long exposure, HDLE) or 3.6% v/v (low dose long exposure, LDLE) respectively, and a 5-day exposure during E7-E11 with 4.2% v/v (high dose short exposure, HDSE). A CHOW group, fed with ad libitum mouse chow and water throughout the experiment, served as the controls. The Micro-CT scan yielded volumetric data for each mouse sample with 40x40x40 um3 voxel spacing. Pups born to all treated dams were scanned at postnatal 7 day (P7) and at P21 for longitudinal studies of craniofacial bone development. Using the Amira software,17 landmarks on the craniofacial bone surfaces were defined to estimate a head size, and the frontal, parietal, occipital and mandible bones were segmented. The volumes of the four bones were analyzed using general linear model with SPSS 19 to examine effect of alcohol disposure on craniofacial bone development while controlling for the head size. Multiple comparison was corrected by the Sidak method. Results: At P7, HDSE showed less volume in all four bones than any other group (p<0.001). At P21, compared with CHOW, HDSE showed reduced volume in all four bones (p<0.027), HDLE in parietal bone only (p=0.006), and LDLE in frontal, parietal and occipital bones (p<0.03). LDLE showed less frontal bone development than HDLE (p=0.048), and HDSE showed less mandible development than HDLE (p=0.005). Conclusion: These results demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure had a dose-and timing-dependent impact on reducing craniofacial bone development after birth. And, the short exposure had an early and sustained effect on all the bones throughout the tested age range, while the long exposure affected only selected bones at a later stage. Further studies on general craniofacial measures will help delineate effects of quantity and frequency of fetal alcohol exposure to enable diagnosis of FASD.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is diagnosed using criteria of growth retardation, nervous system damage, and a distinct pattern of facial dysmorphology. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) show a wide spectrum of pathognomonic facial features that are thought to be attributed to differences in alcohol dose, or the developmental period of exposure. This study explored alcohol induced facial abnormalities attributed to varied alcohol dose and or distinct developmental periods, Using a mouse model of liquid diet alcohol exposure we examined alcohol doses of 4.0% v/v and 3.1% v/v with exposure stages from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E11 and E7-E16. Female C56BL/6J mice were divided into three groups. Chow groups were given ad libitum chow and water throughout the experimental period. The alcohol groups (Alc) were given a liquid diet of either 3.1%v/v or 4.0%v/v alcohol for 1 week prior to mating. During pregnancy the Alc groups were alcohol diet on embryonic days 7 (E7)-E11 or E7-E16. The Pair-fed (PF) dams were given equal volumes of an isocaloric diet parrelled to Alc groups. All embryos were analyzed at E17 using 15 facial measurements (derived analogs of human anthropometry), along with measures of crown-rump, weight, and head circumference. Statistical analysis was performed using both 2 and 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, testing individual treatment effects within groups and effect of stage, dose, and txt (alc vs pf). At 4.8% alcohol dose exposure stages demonstrated altered whisker pad, all facial depth measurements, and lower facial height at E7-E16 with only upper facial depth, and minimal frontal height differences within E7-E11. At 3.1% dose, differences were minimal between with dysmorpholgy of columella and philtrum at longer exposure not seen at E7-E11. Variations effected by alcohol dose were pronounced with width, height and depth measurements at 4.0% not seen at 3.1%. There were distinct difference in columella and philtrum at 3.6% not seen at the 4.0% dose comparing longer stage exposure. The dose and duration of alcohol exposure are important factors contributing to the severity of facial dysmophology and growth retardation. High dose alcohol demonstrated more dysmorphic features then lower dose, with distinct morphological changes between doses. The shorter stage (E7-E11) exposure showed less dysmorphology in both alcohol doses.

N2  - Varying brain retardation is one of the most critical features of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). MRI studies have shown regional patterns of dysmorphology including microcephaly, and altered cortical thickness, corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis structures. However, how do alcohol dose and timing affect variable brain dysfunction is not clear. Our recent studies have shown the dose- and exposure-length dependent alcohol effects on the craniofacial as well as skull bone volume developments. This study investigated how comparable the brain and craniofacial developments were impacted under the alcohol influence in the same set of mice. C57BL/6J dams were randomly assigned into three alcohol exposure (ALC) groups subjecting to 4.2% v/v (E7 - E11 or E7 - E16) or 3.6% v/v (E7 - E16) respectively. The pair-fed (PF) and CHOW groups were included to serve as non-alcohol and overall controls. On postnatal days (P) 21, mouse heads were imaged using a 9.4T preclinical MRI system with 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequence to acquire volumetric images with voxel size as low as 40 microns. Regions of interests including the whole brain, olfactory bulbs, cortex, and cerebellum were segmented and the volumes were calculated. Data was examined by ANOVA followed with paired comparison between treatment groups to test the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure.Calculating from amount of food intake, we found liquid diet group consume similar level of calories but less amount of micronutrient (<50% across the elements, e.g. iron, zinc, vitamin B1). The 4.2% ALC treated group (E7 - E16) showed consistently smaller mean volumes for brain regions measured than the other two groups, indicating that prenatal alcohol exposure hampered fetal brain development. Comparing PF with CHOW pups, only cerebellum volume was observed to be significantly different. These results suggest that alcohol and nutrition both could contribute to brain volume reduction. Alcohol under restricted micronutrient has broader impact in more brain regions. Furthermore, the effect of alcohol on brain volume reduction is dose dependent. These results are comparable with craniofacial and skull bone volume analyses performed on the same subjects. These results demonstrated that alcohol exposure led to comparable effect on brain volume reduction and degree of facial dysmorphology, and demonstrated an important information how facial dysmorphology might be a mirror of the brain in FASD.

N2  - It is critical that we better understand why there is substantial phenotypic variability following prenatal alcohol exposure. It is likely that genetic and environmental risk factors affect the degree to which prenatal alcohol exposure results in the characteristic features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Genetic screens using the zebrafish model have been particularly useful in advancing our understanding of vertebrate development. Depending upon the mutated gene, zebrafish exposed to alcohol during early embryonic development have variable craniofacial defects of the jaw, palate and skull base. Using this model, several genes within the Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathways appear to have gene x alcohol exposure interactions - suggesting that these genes may play a role in the variable effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. To further explore these genes, we utilized genotypic data from a genomewide SNP array in a sample of 240 individuals with variable alcohol exposure. All individuals completed a uniform neurobehavioral evaluation and most also had a 3D facial image. Brain (MRI) imaging was available for 70 subjects. Initial analyses were performed to evaluate 11 candidate genes in the PDGF, FGF, and BMP pathways. Analyses were limited to the Caucasian subset (n=94) due to racial differences in facial measurements. Based on the results of analyses in the zebrafish, 5 anthropometric measurements, corrected for age and gender, were initially analyzed: inner canthal width, outer canthal width, lower facial height, lower facial depth, and midfacial depth. The analytic model included the main effects of SNP genotype and prenatal alcohol exposure (Yes or No) as well as the interaction of SNP with prenatal alcohol exposure (the key variable of interest).Promising evidence of association was found with 6 SNPs in PDGFRB (genotype x exposure p < 3 x 10-3) with the phenotypes of mid and lower facial depths. One SNP in PDGFRA provided evidence of association with several anthropometric measures (p <1.7 x 10-3). Ongoing analyses are examining these candidate genes for their association with specific neurobehavioral and brain imaging phenotypes.

T1  - Assessing teratogenic changes in a zebrafish model of fetal alcohol exposure

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a severe manifestation of embryonic exposure to ethanol. It presents with characteristic defects to the face and organs, including mental retardation due to disordered and damaged brain development. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a term used to cover a continuum of birth defects that occur due to maternal alcohol consumption, and occurs in approximately 4% of children born in the United States. With 50% of child-bearing age women reporting consumption of alcohol, and half of all pregnancies being unplanned, unintentional exposure is a continuing issue. In order to best understand the damage produced by ethanol, plus produce a model with which to test potential interventions, we developed a model of developmental ethanol exposure using the zebrafish embryo. Zebrafish are ideal for this kind of teratogen study. Each pair lays hundreds of eggs, which can then be collected without harming the adult fish. The zebrafish embryo is transparent and can be readily imaged with any number of stains. Analysis of these embryos after exposure to ethanol at different doses and times of duration and application shows that the gross developmental defects produced by ethanol are consistent with the human birth defect. Described here are the basic techniques used to study and manipulate the zebrafish FAS model.

N2  - Introduction: Ethanol consumption by pregnant women can produce severe effects in the foetus and the newborn, mainly in neurological and weight-height development, and are included in the term FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder). Questionnaires are the most used screening method to detect prenatal exposure, but a previous population study questioned its reliability. The objective of this study was to compare alcohol prenatal exposure detection by questionnaire compared with biomarkers in meconium. Methodology: Sixty two meconium samples from mothers who denied alcohol consumption during pregnancy by questionnaire were analysed. The objective analysis was made by determination of FAEEs (fatty acid ethyl esters) as exposure biomarkers in meconium as biological matrix. Results: In the meconium from 10 of 62 newborns from non-alcohol consuming mothers by questionnaire (16.12%) FAEE values were positive (> 2 nmol/g). Discussion: Questionnaires as a screening method during pregnancy are not a reliable tool. It is necessary to identify prenatal exposure to alcohol as soon as possible by biomarkers analysis in biological matrices from the newborn or the mother. The early detection will allow these patients to benefit from follow up and treatment to reach the best possible neurological development. © 2012 Asociacion Espanolade Pediatria.

N2  - In this study event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on response inhibition identified during task performance. ERPs were recorded during a auditory Go/No Go task in two groups of children with mean age of 12.8 years (11 years to 14.7 years): one diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (FAS/PFAS; n = 12) and a control group of children of same age whose mothers abstained from alcohol or drank minimally during pregnancy (n = 11). The children were instructed to push a button in response to the Go stimulus and not to press the button when the No Go stimulus were heard. Task performance accuracy did not differ between the two groups, however differences were observed in the ERP components: P2, N2, and P3. The P2 amplitude were larger for Go trials in both groups. The FAS/PFAS group showed slower N2 response to Go trials, suggesting a less efficient early classification of the stimulus. P3 showed larger amplitudes to No-Go vs. Go in both groups. The study has provided new evidence for inhibition deficits in FAS/PFAS subjects identified by ERPs.

N2  - Many women continue to consume low to moderate quantities of alcohol during pregnancy, which can result in the variable neurobehavioural effects in the absence of physiological abnormalities that characterize fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Previously, we reported that a mouse model for FASD based on voluntary maternal ethanol consumption throughout gestation resulted in offspring that showed mild developmental delay, anxiety-related traits, and deficits in spatial learning. Here, we extend this model by evaluating the gene expression changes that occur in the adult brain of C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to ethanol via maternal preference drinking. The results of two independent expression array experiments indicate that ethanol induces subtle but consistent changes to global gene expression. Gene enrichment analysis showed over-represented gene ontology classifications of cellular, embryonic, and nervous system development. Molecular network analysis supported these classifications, with significant networks related to cellular and tissue development, free radical scavenging, and small molecule metabolism. Further, a number of genes identified have previously been implicated in FASD-relevant neurobehavioural phenotypes such as cognitive function (Ache, Bcl2, Cul4b, Dkc1, Ebp, Lcat, Nsdh1, Sstr3), anxiety (Bcl2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Nsdh1), and mood disorders (Bcl2, Otx2, Sstr3). The results suggest a complex residual "footprint" of neurodevelopmental ethanol exposure that may provide a new perspective for identifying mechanisms that underlie the life-long persistence of FASD-related cognitive and behavioural alterations, including potential targets for treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Ethanol Affects Differentiation-Related Pathways and Suppresses Wnt Signaling Protein Expression in Human Neural Stem Cells

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure of the fetus to ethanol (EtOH) can be teratogenic. We previously showed that EtOH alters the cell fate of human neural stem cells (NSC). As Wnt signaling plays an important role in fetal brain development, we hypothesized that EtOH suppresses Wnt signaling protein expression in differentiating NSC and thereby contributes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Methods: NSC isolated from fetal human brains were cultured in mitogenic media to induce neurospheres, which were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and used for all experiments. Equal numbers of NSC were cultured on lysine/laminin-coated plates for 96hours in differentiating media containing 0, 20, or 100mM EtOH. Total mRNA was isolated from samples containing 0 or 100mM EtOH and changes in expression of 263 genes associated with neurogenesis and NSC differentiation were determined by Oligo GEArray technology. The biological impact of gene changes was estimated using a systems biology approach with pathway express software and KEGG database. Based on the pathways identified, expression of Wnt proteins (Wnt3a and Wnt5a), Wnt-receptor complex proteins (p-LRP6, LRP6, DVL2, and DVL3), Wnt antagonist Naked-2 (NKD-2), and downstream Wnt proteins (beta-catenin, Tyr-p-GSK3beta, Ser-p-GSK3beta) were analyzed by Western blot. Results: Of the 263 genes examined, the expressions of 22 genes in differentiating NSC were either upwardly or downwardly affected by EtOH. These genes are associated with 5 pathways/cellular processes: axon guidance; hedgehog signaling; TGF-beta signaling; cell adhesion molecules; and Wnt signaling. When compared to controls, EtOH, at both 20 and 100mM concentrations, suppressed the expression of Wnt3a and Wnt5a, receptor complex proteins p-LRP6, LRP6 and DVL2, and cytoplasmic proteins Ser-p-GSK3beta and beta-catenin. Expression of NKD-2 and DVL3 remained unchanged and the expression of active Tyr-p-GSK3beta increased significantly. Conclusions: EtOH can significantly alter neural differentiation pathway-related gene expression and suppress Wnt signaling proteins in differentiating human NSC. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Structural abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC), such as reduced size and increased shape variability, have been documented in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the regional specificity of altered CC structure, which may point to the timing of neurodevelopmental disturbances and/or relate to specific functional impairments, remains unclear. Furthermore, associations between facial dysmorphology and callosal structure remain undetermined. Methods: One hundred and fifty-three participants (age range 8 to 16) including 82 subjects with FASD and 71 nonexposed controls were included in this study. The structural magnetic resonance imaging data of these subjects was collected at 3 sites (Los Angeles and San Diego, California, and Cape Town, South Africa) and analyzed using classical parcellation schemes, as well as more refined surface-based geometrical modeling methods, to identify callosal morphological alterations in FASD at high spatial resolution. Results: Reductions in callosal thickness and area, specifically in the anterior third and the splenium, were observed in FASD compared with nonexposed controls. In addition, reduced CC thickness and area significantly correlated with reduced palpebral fissure length. Conclusions: Consistent with previous reports, findings suggest an adverse effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on callosal growth and further indicate that fiber pathways connecting frontal and parieto-occipital regions in each hemisphere may be particularly affected. Significant associations between callosal and facial dysmorphology provide evidence for a concurrent insult to midline facial and brain structural development in FASD. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Accumulating evidence from structural brain imaging studies on individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has supported links between prenatal alcohol exposure and brain morphological deficits. Although global and regional volumetric reductions appear relatively robust, the effects of alcohol exposure on cortical thickness and relationships with facial dysmorphology are not yet known. The structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 69 children and adolescents with FASD and 58 nonexposed controls collected from 3 sites were examined using FreeSurfer to detect cortical thickness changes across the entire brain in FASD and their associations with facial dysmorphology. Controlling for brain size, subjects with FASD showed significantly thicker cortices than controls in several frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Analyses conducted within site further revealed prominent group differences in left inferior frontal cortex within all 3 sites. In addition, increased inferior frontal thickness was significantly correlated with reduced palpebral fissure length. Consistent with previous reports, findings of this study are supportive of regional increases in cortical thickness serving as a biomarker for disrupted brain development in FASD. Furthermore, the significant associations between thickness and dysmorphic measures suggest that the severity of brain anomalies may be reflected by that of the face. © 2011 The Author.

N2  - Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are validated biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure. Meconium FAEE testing can potentially be used as a screen by health-care professionals to identify neonates at-risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, thereby permitting diagnostic follow-up of these children and early intervention in those who develop disabilities. The purpose of this study was to assess whether women would willingly partake in a screening program of this nature. This was determined by launching a pilot screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure in a high-risk obstetric unit previously shown to have a high prevalence of FAEE-positive meconium via anonymous meconium testing. The program involved voluntary testing of meconium for FAEEs and long-term developmental follow-up of positive cases through an existing public health program. The participation rate in the screening program was significantly lower than when testing was conducted anonymously (78% vs. 95%, respectively; p < 0.05), and the positivity rate was 3% in contrast to 30% observed under anonymous conditions (p < 0.001). These low rates suggest that the majority of mothers who consumed alcohol in pregnancy refused to participate. We conclude that despite the potential benefits of such screening programs, maternal unwillingness to consent, likely due to fear, embarrassment, and guilt, may limit the effectiveness of meconium testing for population-based open screening, highlighting the need for public education and social marketing efforts for such programs to be of benefit. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - It has been elucidated that psychiatric disorders are associated with impairment of the brain neural network. Reduction in brain size and hypoplasia of the basal ganglia and corpus callosum have been reported in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). It is believed that the formation of the neural network is influenced by alcohol exposure during the fetal period. Additionally, it is well known that the functional expression of CNS consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure includes cognitive and attentional processes, as well as social behavioral problems. It has also been reported that abnormal 5-HT neuron development can be reversed by treatment with a 5-HT1A agonist in a prenatal alcohol exposure model. However, these treatments are prophylactic. Without early intervention, the consequences of FASD are permanent. Recently, emerging evidence suggest that many clinical symptoms observed in psychiatric disease are likely related to neural network disruptions including neurogenesis dysfunction. Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has been investigated in areas such as brain injury, stroke and neurodegenerative diseases and may be a way to reverse neurogenesis dysfunction. In the present work, we evaluated the usefulness of intravenous transplantation of NSCs in the FASD model rat focusing on the possibility of regenerative therapy, particularly regarding behavioral abnormalities, for FASD rats. Abnormal behaviors FASD model rats suggest that reduced social activity , and cognitive dysfunction are major symptoms in FASD patients. Intravenous NSC transplantation appeared to partially correct these behavioral abnormalities in FASD model rats. In the Amygdala areas intravenous NSC transplantation appears to have partially regaenerates expression of PSD95 in FASD model rats. The results suggest that intravenous NSC transplantation may be an advanced approach to recover neural network damage and CNS dysfunction in FASD and possibly other psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure results in major neurodevelopmental deficits. Cognitive impairments are generally most severe in children who meet diagnostic criteria for full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), but significant deficits are also observed in non-syndromal heavily-exposed (HE) children. However, the correlates of these effects in terms of disordered network interactions in the brain have never before been investigated. We used psycho-physiological interaction (Friston et al., 1997) to investigate differential effects of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; an important control region) on modulation of fronto-striatal-cerebellar regions during a simple working memory (WM) task (1-back). Methods: Data were collected in FAS/PFAS (n=17), HE (n=13) and Controls (n=17) groups (M: 8.9<age<10.6 yrs). The task alternated between 0-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), 1-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), and rest (20 s) epochs. Time series from the dACC (p<.05, effects of interest) were convolved with the psychological contrast of interest (1-back > 0-back) to investigate modulatory effects. Inter-group differences were evaluated in a second level analysis of variance with group as single factor. Results: See Figure. Conclusions: The increased modulation by the dACC of key brain regions mediating working memory suggests increased cognitive control-related inputs to sub-serve function in FAS/PFAS and HE children. These results constitute the first demonstration of the distal effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the disruption of functional interactions between key brain regions.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which manifests itself in the form of physiological defects, mental retardation and neurobehavioural deficits, the latter of which is rarely diagnosed. Since maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure and risk for FASD. While Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters (FAEEs) are current biomarkers of exposure, the introduction of a second biomarker that can be tested alongside FAEEs promises to greatly increase the sensitivity and specificity of analytical screens. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium, or first stool of life, of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Whether this detected EtG was formed by the maternal liver and crossed the placenta, by the fetal liver after ethanol crossed the placenta, or by the placenta itself remains unknown. Objectives: To determine if, and to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta, and to measure placental formation and degradation of EtG. Methods: Placentae from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario will be taken to the on-site perfusion laboratory. One mug/mL EtG will be added to the maternal reservoir and maternal and fetal samples will be taken over a 3 hour period to determine if and to what degree EtG is crossing the human placenta. EtG will be quantified using HS-SPME GC-MS. Placental metabolism of ethanol to EtG and EtG to ethanol will be investigated using placental microsomes. Kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km) will also be determined to help elucidate the role of the placenta in formation and degradation of EtG. Results: To date the perfusions are being carried out and the level of EtG in the perfusate will be determined using HS-SPME GC-MS with a limit of sensitivity of 1 ng/vial. Conclusions: We have developed a HS-SPME method for detecting EtG in maternal and fetal perfusate samples. This will allow us to accurately quantify the transfer of EtG across the human placenta.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase prevent cellular damage produced by free radicals. Our objective was to evaluate if prenatal alcohol exposure decreased the expression of antioxidant enzymes in the brain, liver, or placenta of fetal mice. STUDY DESIGN: Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with intraperitoneal injection of alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or saline (control). Fetuses were harvested on gestational day 18. Fetal brain, liver, and placenta were analyzed for mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase by real-time polymerase chain reaction, with 18S RNA used as reference. RESULTS: Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase expression was lower in fetal brains exposed to alcohol with no differences detected in the liver or placenta between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Maternal alcohol consumption causes a decrease in superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase expression in the fetal brain. This may explain the long-term neurologic findings in fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Alcoholism during pregnancy is one of the most common factors in western societies causing persisting congenital and multiple physical as well as neurological impairments. Finding the diagnosis at first sight puts medical professionals into a demanding situation. Therefore the objective of this study was to detect patients' developmental characteristics with the main focus on the necessity of the diagnosis itself. Patients: 125 young patients, whose diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made at the Muenster University Hospital, were followed up. Methods: Biographic details such as living conditions, health, developmental problems and educational career were gathered using a structured interview. The diagnosis itself and the impact of this on the patients were also explored. Results: Patients displayed characteristics of a less mature trait of character. The majority were looked after by foster parents. High rates of social and developmental problems could be found. The diagnosis was identified as a protective factor, with significantly better outcomes for patients being diagnosed in early childhood. A diagnosis established later in life was particularly helpful for the families and caregivers. Feelings of failure and self-blame could be diminished. Conclusions: The early detection of affected children has to be improved as receiving the correct diagnosis, despite the persistent impairments, is of major benefit for both patients and their families. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart  New York.

N2  - Background: The physical features of fetal alcohol syndrome include smooth philtrum, thin vermillion border, short palpebral fissures, microcephaly, and growth deficiencies on weight and height. However, little is known about the specific quantities of alcohol exposure, pattern of drinking, timing of exposure, and magnitude of risk for each of these features. Methods: Using data on 992 subjects collected prospectively in California between 1978 and 2005, we examined the patterns and timing of alcohol exposure in relation to these features. Structural features were assessed by a dysmorphologist who performed a blinded physical examination of all infants. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0 to 6weeks postconception, 6 to 12weeks postconception, first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester. Results: Higher prenatal alcohol exposure in every pattern was significantly associated with the incidence of smooth philtrum but not with short palpebral fissures. The strongest associations were with timing of exposure in the second half of the first trimester (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.36 for average number of drinks per day; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.26 for maximum number of drinks in 1 episode). Similarly, thin vermillion border was most strongly associated with exposure in the second half of the first trimester. Findings with respect to timing of exposure were similar for microcephaly and reduced birth weight. However, reduced birth length was increased with exposure in any trimester. These associations were linear, and there was no evidence of a threshold. Conclusions: Reduced birth length and weight, microcephaly, smooth philtrum, and thin vermillion border are associated with specific gestational timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and are dose-related without evidence of a threshold. Women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol consumption from conception throughout pregnancy. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Individuals gestationally exposed to alcohol experience a multitude of sociobehavioral impairments, including deficits in adaptive behaviors such as social skills. Methods: The goal of this report is to critically review research on social skills deficits in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure, including individuals with and without fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Results: Social deficits are found in alcohol-exposed children, adults, and adolescents with and without a clinical presentation. These deficits tend to persist across the lifespan and may even worsen with age. Social deficits in this population appear to be independent of facial dysmorphology and IQ and are worse than can be predicted based on atypical behaviors alone. Abnormalities in neurobiology, executive function, sensory processing, and communication likely interact with contextual influences to produce the range of social deficits observed in FASD. Conclusions: Future investigations should strive to reconcile the relationship between social skills deficits in FASD and variables such as gender, age, cognitive profile, and structural and functional brain impairments to enable better characterization of the deficits observed in this population, which will enhance diagnosis and improve remediation. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - In part 1, we discussed the mechanism of alcohol exposure, dosimetry, and the teratogenic pathways of damage to the fetus. In part 2, we review the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and the developmental implications of prenatal alcohol exposure. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are associated with increased rates of mental retardation, seizure disorders, brain malformations, and premature mortality. The risk of comorbid disorders is increased among this population, which enhances phenotype severity and complexity of management. Recurrence rates are high and younger siblings tend to be more severely affected. Detection of prenatal alcohol use warrants substance abuse intervention, which can avoid exposure in subsequent pregnancies. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are common developmental disorders with a phenotype that is influenced by both age and development and require long-term management. Child neurologists are essential in the diagnosis and management of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - Individuals with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure can experience significant deficits in cognitive and psychosocial functioning and alterations in brain structure that persist into adulthood. In this report, data from 99 participants collected across three sites (Los Angeles and San Diego, California, and Cape Town, South Africa) were analyzed to examine relationships between brain structure, neurocognitive function, facial morphology, and maternal reports of quantities of alcohol consumption during the first trimester. Across study sites, we found highly significant volume reductions in the FASD group for all of the brain regions evaluated. After correcting for scan location, age, and total brain volume, these differences remained significant in some regions of the basal ganglia and diencephalon. In alcohol-exposed subjects, we found that smaller palpebral fissures were significantly associated with reduced volumes in the ventral diencephalon bilaterally, that greater dysmorphology of the philtrum predicted smaller volumes in basal ganglia and diencephalic structures, and that lower IQ scores were associated with both smaller basal ganglia volumes and greater facial dysmorphology. In subjects from South Africa, we found a significant negative correlation between intracranial volume and total number of drinks per week in the first trimester. These results corroborate previous reports that prenatal alcohol exposure is particularly toxic to basal ganglia and diencephalic structures. We extend previous findings by illustrating relationships between specific measures of facial dysmorphology and the volumes of particular subcortical structures, and for the first time show that continuous measures of maternal alcohol consumption during the first trimester relates to overall brain volume reduction. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Alcohol- induced behavioural problems in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder versus confounding behavioural problems
A1  - Malone M.
A1  - Koren G.
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is strongly associated with disruptive behaviour in childhood and antisocial behaviour later in life. There are numerous confounding risk factors in the lives of alcohol-abusing mothers that may contribute to the behaviour problems seen in their children, rather than direct brain injury by alcohol. In fact, many of these additional environmental and genetic risk factors for childhood behaviour problems co-occur with prenatal alcohol exposure and affect the same child, creating a confluence of risk. As a result, one cannot with any certainty attribute behaviour problems in an individual child to prenatal alcohol exposure. This has important clinical and legal implications. © 2012 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. All rights reserved.

N2  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium are validated biomarkers of heavy fetal alcohol exposure that may potentially be used clinically for identifying children at risk for alcohol-related disabilities. However, until now, FAEEs have been largely used anonymously in epidemiological studies, and by child protection authorities in need for verification of heavy alcohol use in pregnancy. Here we describe the first case of a neonate identified as part of a research study on a pilot neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure. The neonate's meconium tested high for FAEEs (52 nmol/g; positive cut-off >2 nmol/g), which prompted active follow-up of the infant's development, identifying early neurocognitive problems and allowing initiation of a remedial program. © 2012 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

T1  - Vitamin A, folate, and choline as a possible preventive intervention to fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Ballard M.S.
A1  - Sun M.
A1  - Ko J.
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - It is recognized that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Alcohol can trigger a pattern of neurodegeneration in rat brains similar to other known gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) specific agonists. However this does not seem to explain FAS entirely, as impoverished care-giving environments have been shown to increase the risk of FAS. Individuals living under the poverty level are at risk for micronutrient deficiencies due to insufficient intake. In particular, three nutrients commonly found to be deficient are folate, choline and vitamin A. There is evidence to suggest that ethanol alone may not explain the entire spectrum of anomalies seen in individuals with FAS. It is hypothesized that FAS may be caused more by the nutritional deficiencies that are exacerbated by alcohol than by direct alcoholic neurotoxicity.It is known that ethanol inhibits folate, choline, and vitamin A/retinoic acid metabolism at multiple steps. Additionally, mice exposed to ethanol demonstrated epigenetic changes, or variations in the methylation of DNA to control gene expression. Folate is important in the production of methyl groups, which are subsequently used to create and methylate DNA. Choline (which is metabolized to acetylcholine) is important in neurotransmission and neurodevelopment. It is also involved in an alternative pathway in the production of methyl groups. In fact a study by Thomas et al. in 2009 found that nutritional supplementation with choline in rats exposed to ethanol in utero almost completely mitigated the degenerative effects of ethanol on development and behaviour. Lastly, vitamin A and retinoic acid metabolism is associated with the regulation of one sixth of the entire proteome. Thus supplementation of folate, choline and vitamin A to mothers may mitigate the effects of the alcohol and reduce the severity or prevalence of FAS. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium, or first stool of life, of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta. METHODS: Placentae (n=4) from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario were taken to the on-site perfusion laboratory. After cannulation and establishment of dual circulation, 1 mug/mL EtG was added to the maternal reservoir and samples were taken throughout the 3 h experiment. Measurements of placental viability were oxygen transfer, pH, glucose consumption, hCG production, fetal reservoir volume, and fetal arterial inflow pressure. EtG was analyzed by GC-MS after solid phase extraction. RESULTS: After 3 h, a fetal-to-maternal ratio of 0.29 was reached, however EtG had not reached steady state between the 2 circulations as net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring at the end of the experiment (Figure). Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all perfusions. CONCLUSION: EtG appears to cross the human placenta and, hence, represent both maternal and fetal load of alcohol.

N2  - In the United States, approximately 80 000 women consume ethanol through all 3 trimesters of pregnancy each year. In this article, we review prevalence rates of prenatal alcohol exposure in the United States and discuss the mechanisms of prenatal alcohol exposure and placental-umbilical effects. Cigarette smoking and delayed prenatal care are often associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. In addition, increased risk for postnatal adversity is common, including maternal depression, foster care placement, and developmental delay. In part 2, we review prevalence rates and the diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and the implications for child neurologists. We discuss management strategies and the importance of a long-term management plan and anticipatory management to prevent the development of secondary disabilities in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Child neurologists play a key role in diagnosis and the development of appropriate intervention programs for affected children and their families. © SAGE Publications 2012.

N2  - Background: It has been estimated that approximately 12% of women consume alcohol at some time during their pregnancy, and as many as 5% of children born in the United States are impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The range of physical, behavioral, emotional, and social dysfunctions that are associated with PAE are collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Methods: Using a saccharin-sweetened ethanol solution, we developed a limited access model of PAE. C57BL/6J mice were provided access to a solution of either 10% (w/v) ethanol and 0.066% (w/v) saccharin or 0.066% (w/v) saccharin (control) for 4h/d. After establishing consistent drinking, mice were mated and continued drinking during gestation. Following parturition, solutions were decreased to 0% in a stepwise fashion over a period of 6days. Characterization of the model included measurements of maternal consumption patterns, blood ethanol levels, litter size, pup weight, maternal care, and the effects of PAE on fear-conditioned and spatial learning, and locomotor activity. Results: Mothers had mean daily ethanol intake of 7.17+/-0.17g ethanol/kg body weight per day, with average blood ethanol concentrations of 68.5+/-9.2mg/dl after 2hours of drinking and 88.3+/-11.5mg/dl after 4hours of drinking. Food and water consumption, maternal weight gain, litter size, pup weight, pup retrieval times, and time on nest did not differ between the alcohol-exposed and control animals. Compared with control offspring, mice that were exposed to ethanol prenatally displayed no difference in spontaneous locomotor activity but demonstrated learning deficits in 3 hippocampal-dependent tasks: delay fear conditioning, trace fear conditioning, and the delay nonmatch to place radial-arm maze task. Conclusions: These results indicate that this model appropriately mimics the human condition of PAE and will be a useful tool in studying the learning deficits seen in FASD. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Choline supplementation mitigates trace, but not delay, eyeblink conditioning deficits in rats exposed to alcohol during development

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Children exposed to alcohol prenatally suffer from a range of physical, neuropathological, and behavioral alterations, referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Both the cerebellum and hippocampus are affected by alcohol exposure during development, which may contribute to behavioral and cognitive deficits observed in children with FASD. Despite the known neuropathology associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, many pregnant women continue to drink (heavy drinkers, in particular), creating a need to identify effective treatments for their children who are adversely affected by alcohol. We previously reported that choline supplementation can mitigate alcohol's effects on cognitive development, specifically on tasks which depend on the functional integrity of the hippocampus. The present study examined whether choline supplementation could differentially mitigate alcohol's effects on trace eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC, a hippocampal-dependent task) and delay ECC (a cerebellar-dependent task). Long-Evans rats were exposed to 5.25 g/kg/day alcohol via gastric intubation from postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to late gestation in humans. A sham-intubated control group was included. From PD 10-30, subjects received subcutaneous injections of 100 mg/kg choline chloride or vehicle. Beginning on PD 32-34, subjects were trained on either delay or trace eyeblink conditioning. Performance of subjects exposed to alcohol was significantly impaired on both tasks, as indicated by significant reductions in percentage and amplitude of conditioned eyeblink responses, an effect that was attenuated by choline supplementation on the trace, but not delay conditioning task. Indeed, alcohol-exposed subjects treated with choline performed at control levels on the trace eyeblink conditioning task. There were no significant main or interactive effects of sex. These data indicate that choline supplementation can significantly reduce the severity of trace eyeblink conditioning deficits associated with early alcohol exposure, even when administered after the alcohol insult is complete. These findings have important implications for the treatment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Despite our increasing knowledge of the magnitude and breadth of abnormalities associated with FASD, little is known about the underlying biological mechanisms. We have established a C57BL/6J mouse model of developmental ethanol exposure that shows FASD-related behavioural phenotypes. In particular, we have shown that that ethanol treatment representing binge-like doses during synaptogenesis (third human trimester equivalent) results in spatial learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze. Using this model, we have also identified genome-wide changes in brain gene expression associated with neurodevelopmental alcohol exposure, both immediately following treatment (4 h postinjection) as well as long-term changes (postnatal day 60). Differentially- expressed genes were extracted (1.5-fold, FDR\0.05) and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology annotations for biological function, pathway, or interactions. Results revealed that the acute response to ethanol (4 h) included significant alterations in inflammatory, cell survival, and, interestingly, circadian rhythm-associated gene pathways. Long-term, persistent gene expression changes were more subtle but affected a number of pathways with wider biological roles. This included significant disruption of cadherin gene family cell adhesion molecules and neurotransmitter-associated pathways (glutamatergic, GABAergic, and serotonin systems were all identified). These data suggest that immediate cell survival mechanisms may induce long-term changes in critical cell-communication mechanisms, which may mediate the effects of ethanol exposure during synaptogenesis and its effects into early adulthood. These genes and pathways have relevance to FASD pathogenesis, and the identification of genome-wide changes in neurodevelopmental genetic programming may facilitate our understanding of the permanent behavioural and neurocellular consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce range of abnormalities and developmental defects to the developing fetus, referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is characterized by a particular pattern of facial anomalies, poor growth, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and defects in several organ systems including heart, kidney, vision, and hearing. FAS babies often have atrial and ventricular septal defects, and other structural cardiovascular defects. The mechanisms by which ethanol disrupts heart morphogenesis is not yet elucidated. We are using zebrafish embryos to investigate ethanol-induced cardiac defects and to dissect mechanisms underlying these defects. To determine heart developmental stage(s) most susceptible to ethanol exposure, we treated embryos in ethanol (0.6% and 0.9% v/v) during different critical stages of embryonic heart development. 1) Ethanol exposure during mesodermal cell migration to anterior lateral plate mesoderm region showed subtle abnormalities in chamber shape and size. 2) In contrast, ethanol treatment during cardiac specification until midline fusion of cardiomyocytes significantly delayed fusion of the bilateral population of myocardial cells (either developmental time or somite stage matched embryos) as revealed by cardiac myosin light chain 2 (cmlc2) in situ hydridization and by live imaging of tg(cmlc2: gfp) embryos. Treated embryos exhibited smaller heart chambers and frequent heart looping defects compared to control at 36 hours postfertilization (hpf). 3) Ethanol exposure during stages from heart cone rotation until chamber formation severely affected heart looping, chamber size, and morphology. At 32 hpf, ethanol induced embryos show narrower, more elongated, poorly looped heart tubes, as compared to normally looped and expanded heart chambers in control embryos. We hypothesized that ethanol competes with retinol and impairs RA synthesis, which interferes with cardiogenesis. In an attempt to rescue the ethanol-induced defects, embryos were co-treated with ethanol and 10-9 M retinoic acid (RA). Strikingly, supplementing all-trans-RA restored cardiomyocyte migration, fusion and rescued morphological defects. We are now examining molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced heart development defects. Understanding these mechanisms will significantly help us understand heart defects in FAS and might provide potential therapeutic targets for patients with this regrettably frequent birth defect.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, producing a spectrum of defects including facial abnormalities, sensory (visual and auditory) deficits, impaired fine motor skills and learning deficits including mental retardation. Our laboratory and others have shown that fetal alcohol syndrome can be modeled in zebrafish by ethanol exposure during early development. We hypothesized that embryonic ethanol exposure may alter the gene transcriptional profile that produces the FAS associated defects. To test that idea, we examined the ethanol induced gene expression changes in zebrafish using Affymetrix gene microarray analyses at early and mid-gastrulation (just prior to neurogenesis) stages. Expression of multiple genes involved in neurogenesis and patterning changed significantly after ethanol exposure, e.g., Delta, Hairy- and enhancer of split-related (Her) genes, Hoxb group of genes. Consistently, ethanol treated embryos showed defects in neural plate formation, neural patterning, neural differentiation, and cranial/lateral line ganglia formation, showing defects in a dose-dependent manner. However, the mechanisms by which ethanol affects normal neurogenesis is not yet clear. Ethanol induced changes in the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the transcription factor, neurogenin1 (ngn1), a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor that controls initial neurogenesis steps. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that ngn1 expression in the ethanol treated embryos was reduced at gastrulation stages and was increased during neurogenesis compared to that of the control embryos. We hypothesized that ethanol affects neural patterning by competing with retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, thus impairing retinoic acid synthesis. We observed that not only the phenotypic defects but many of the neural differentiation and patterning defects induced by ethanol exposure were rescued by a co-treatment with retinoic acid in the medium. Future work focuses on dissecting the molecular mechanisms behind ethanol defects and the retinoic acid rescue on neural development. Understanding neural development mechanisms disrupted by ethanol exposure will help identify potential therapeutic targets for neural defects in FAS.

T1  - Decreasing women's alcohol use during pregnancy
A1  - Osterman R.L.
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - A woman's use of alcohol during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), a combination of physical, neurological, and cognitive/behavioral abnormalities that has serious, lifelong ramifications for the child. Still pregnant women continue to consume alcohol with recently reported prevalence estimates of FASD on the increase. Intervention studies have been successful in decreasing prenatal alcohol use in alcohol dependent and nondependent women. Yet translation of these interventions into clinical practice is essential to prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancies. This article provides information to assist practitioners in the provision of evidence-based interventions that decrease prenatal alcohol use, thereby, decreasing future incidence of FASD.

N2  - Background: HIV-positive pregnant women who drink put their children at risk of both HIV and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) has the highest prevalence of HIV in South Africa, but has not before been considered an area of high alcohol consumption among women. This paper analyzes a large sample of HIV+ pregnant women in KZN to examine alcohol consumption in that population. Methods: Data came from assessments of women enrolled in Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission programs at 8 clinics in KZN. Descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were used to examine the prevalence and correlates of alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Results: Of 1201 women assessed, 18% reported drinking during pregnancy, and 67% of drinkers usually binged when drinking (had 3+ drinks in one sitting). Over one-third of drinkers binged twice a month or more. Women living in urban and peri-urban locations were more likely to drink, as were those with indicators of higher economic status and greater social engagement. Married women were less likely to drink, while women who had poorer mental health, used tobacco, or had a greater history of sexual risk-taking were more likely to drink. Conclusion: Health care workers in KZN should be aware that pregnant women who drink are likely to do so at a level that is dangerous for their babies. Some factors associated with drinking indicate social/environmental influences that need to be counteracted by greater dissemination of information about the dangers of drinking, and greater support for abstinence or moderation. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) represent a significant public health problem. The influence of the male partner's alcohol consumption patterns and the quality of the partner's intimate relationship might be important factors to consider in the design of successful FASD prevention programs. Method: As part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, 166 pregnant women in two regions in Ukraine participated in an in-person interview at an average gestational age of 18-19 weeks. Subjects were classified cross-sectionally as abstainers/light drinkers (n = 80), defined as low or no consumption of alcohol in the periconceptional period and none in the most recent 2 weeks of pregnancy; discontinuers (n = 43), defined as moderate to heavy alcohol use in the periconceptional period but none during the most recent 2 weeks of pregnancy; or continuing drinkers (n = 43), defined as continued moderate to heavy alcohol use within the most recent 2 weeks of pregnancy. Women also reported on their partner's drinking behavior and on the quality of their intimate relation- ship. Results: Heavy paternal drinking was significantly associated with both continuing maternal drinking in the most recent 2 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 34.1; 95% CI [5.9, 195.8]) and being a risky drinker only around conception (adjusted OR = 27.0; 95% CI [5.0, 147.7]). In addition, women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy had lower mean scores for satisfaction with partners' relationship and ability to discuss problems (p <.05) compared with light drinkers/abstainers. Conclusions: This study suggests that development of partner-based interventions, as opposed to those solely focused on maternal drinking, might be warranted as a strategy to prevent FASD.

N2  - Objective: South Africa has among the highest reported rates of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) globally. Primary prevention targeting women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies could substantially reduce the incidence of FAS. We evaluated the effectiveness of a short training intervention to improve service providers' screening, identification, and management of women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Method: Training to screen and counsel women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies was offered to 86 service providers (95% of whom were female) in two municipalities in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Effectiveness was evaluated through a before-after study of service providers' knowledge and confidence levels and a comparison of service providers' practices (assessed indirectly via service user exit interviews) at intervention and control clinics. Results: The proportion of service providers indicating that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the fetus increased after training (23% vs. 67%; p< 001). After training, providers expressed significantly more confidence for four skills indicators related to the identification and management of women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Female clients at intervention clinics were more likely than those at the control clinics to receive alcohol advice (odds ratio [OR] = 2.13, 95% CI [1.27, 3.53]), counseling (OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.05, 1.56]), and an offer of family planning (OR= 1.1, 95% CI [1.06, 2.10]) after the training. Time x Group interaction variable analysis in multiple logistic regression modeling confirmed these effects as related to training. Conclusions: A short training course based on brief motivational interviewing principles appears to be effective in building service provider capacity to better prevent and manage women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A native American journey to prevention
A1  - Beckett C.D.
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, the most common preventable cause for mental retardation, is the result of prenatal alcohol exposure. There is no safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy. Native Americans have a higher risk of alcohol abuse than the general US population. The fetal alcohol spectrum disorders prevalence rates for Native Americans range from 1.0 to 8.97 per 1000 births. Nurses and health care providers working in collaboration with tribal fetal alcohol spectrum disorders prevention specialists can greatly, and positively, impact the physical and mental health and well-being of children in Native American communities.

T1  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy: evidence from Canadian Community Health Survey 2007/2008

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy may cause many health problems for the child, one of which is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Since FASD is incurable, actions meant to prevent the occurrence of the disability by targeting drinking women become more important. Epidemiological data on drinking among pregnant women, including prevalence and determinants/risk factors, is essential for designing and evaluating prevention programs. To estimate the prevalence of drinking alcohol during pregnancy and examine the determinants of this behaviour. Using the 2007/8 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) data, we estimated the weighted prevalence of women who drank alcohol during their last pregnancy by provinces. We used a weighted logistic regression to examine associations between drinking patterns, substance abuse behaviours, health-related and socio-demographic characteristics of the women, and the outcome variable. There were two main findings of this study. One was that the 2007/8 prevalence of drinking alcohol during pregnancy in ON, BC, and Canada was estimated at 5.4%, 7.2%, and 5.8%, respectively. The other was that the use of general practitioners (GP) or family physicians (FP) associated with a decreased risk of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. The results suggest that interventions that involve GP or FP and that increase the use of GP or FP by pregnant women can be effective in reducing drinking alcohol during pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Preventing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) depends on obstetricians detecting maternal risk drinking during antenatal care. ACOG and NIAAA recommend using the T-ACE, an economical/ sensitive screen. We have reported that a more stringent T-ACE total score cut-point (3 vs. 2) increased specificity in identifying maternal risk drinking & alcohol-related neurobehavioral dysfunction in children (Chiodo et al, 2010). Our aim was to assess how increasing the T-ACE cut-point could increase efficiency of clinical practice. STUDY DESIGN: Self-reported peri-conceptional & in-pregnancy drinking were assessed with semi-structured interviews and alcohol screens in a prospective sub-sample of 239 African-American mothers given an in-pregnancy T-ACE. The original T-ACE risk criterion (total score of 2) and the revised T-ACER3 criterion with a total score of 3 were analyzed. ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons compared preand in-pregnancy alcohol consumption quantity and frequency measures by risk category. Categories were: 1) No Risk Group (NRG) = no risk for pregnancy alcohol use based on both T-ACE and T-ACER3 criteria (n=140); 2) At Risk Group (ARG) based on both T-ACE and T-ACER3 criteria (n=28); and 3) Change Risk Group (CRG) identified as at-risk with the original T-ACE criterion but not at-risk using the revised T-ACER3 criterion (n=71). RESULTS: The 71 women (30%) in the Change Risk Group (CRG) had patterns of alcohol use similar to the no risk group (NRG). As predicted, post-hoc analysis revealed that the at-risk group (ARG) had significantly more alcohol use both prior to and during pregnancy than either the NRG or CRG groups. CONCLUSION: The results provide further evidence that adjusting the T-ACE total score cut-point to 3 in the T-ACER3 is clinically appropriate. Using the T-ACER3 criteria, only 12% of women would require intervention, compared with 41% for T-ACE. Increasing the total T-ACE score criterion from 2 to 3 results in fewer "false positives," allowing a more intensive targeted clinical response with pregnant women correctly identified by the T-ACER3 as drinking at fetal risk levels.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreases the fetal brain mRNA expression of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD). Our OBJECTIVE was to elucidate the role of oxidant/antioxidant mechanisms in the etiology of FAS by determining whether decrease in SODmRNAexpression is associated with reduced protein expression and/or enzymatic activity. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or vehicle. Fetuses were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18) and their brain processed for protein analysis and enzymatic activity. Western Blots were performed assessing protein expression of SOD normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). SOD activity was measured using an assay based on inhibition of XTT reduction by superoxide. The rate of superoxide dismutation was calculated by the reciprocal rate of formazan formation as measured calorimetrically at an absorbance of 490nm over 30 minutes. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test (significance: p<0.05). RESULTS: Fetal alcohol exposure caused a significant increase in protein expression (0.63 vs 0.27 ratio protein/GAPDH; p=0.02) and no difference in enzymatic activity of SOD (31.9 vs. 32.3 arbitrary units; p>0.10) at E18 when compared to vehicle treated controls. CONCLUSION: The previously reported decrease in fetal brain SOD mRNA expression in FAS is not associated with a decrease in protein expression, nor with altered SOD activity. In fetuses exposed to alcohol, increased SOD protein expression is not accompanied by increased activity of SOD. These findings suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to the preservation of SOD protein expression and activity in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreases antioxidant enzymes in the fetal brain in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Exposure to alcohol is known to decrease expression of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) a serine threonine kinase that regulates glycogen synthesis through phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase. In addition to regulation of glycogen, GSK-3beta is positively correlated with expression of nuclear transcription factors, NF-kappa beta and Nrf2, which are inactive in the cytosol and active within nucleus. Our objective was to evaluate if the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on fetal brain antioxidants can be explained by an effect on GSK-3beta, NF-kappa beta and Nrf2. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or vehicle. Fetuses were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18), and the brain prepared for protein analysis. Western Blots were performed assessing the protein expression of GSK-3beta and cytosolic and nuclear expression ofNF-kappa beta and Nrf2 normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test (significance: p<0.05). RESULTS: GSK-3beta protein levels were significantly lower (0.73 vs 1.06 ratio protein/GAPDH; p=0.01) and cytosolic Nrf2 protein levels were significantly higher (0.72 vs 0.43 ratio protein/GAPDH; p=0.01) in the brain of pups exposed to alcohol compared with control. There was no significant difference in cytosolic expression of NF-kappa beta or nuclear expression of NF-kappa beta and Nrf2 between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In utero exposure to alcohol reduces GSK-3 and increases cytosolic Nrf2 protein levels in the fetal brain. These findings provide a mechanism for the decrease in antioxidants in the brain of FAS offspring, and a potential target for preventive strategies.

N2  - Aims: Prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is remarkably high in several provinces of South Africa; yet population-level knowledge of the harms of maternal drinking remains low. In two heavily affected areas, we assessed effectiveness of interventions to heighten awareness of these harms and to alter social norms about drinking in pregnancy. Methods: FASD prevalence, maternal knowledge and drinking behaviours were investigated in two Northern Cape Province towns, before and after interventions which included highlighting FASD using local media and health promotion talks at health facilities. Independently, two dysmorphologists and a neuropsychometrist examined children at 9 and 18 months. Results: Pre-intervention maternal knowledge of alcohol harms was low and FASD prevalence 8.9% (72/809). Interventions reached high coverage and knowledge levels increased substantially. FASD prevalence was 5.7% post-intervention (43/751; P=0.02); 0.73 lower odds, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity (95% confidence interval=0.58-0.90). No change was detected in more severe FASD forms, but in the whole population, median dysmorphology scores reduced from 4 [inter-quartile range (IQR)=2-7] to 3 (IQR=1-6; P=0.002). Conclusion: This, the first prevention study using FASD outcomes, suggests that universal prevention might reduce FASD by ~30% and have population-level effects. This supports intensifying universal interventions where knowledge of harms of maternal drinking is low. These efforts need to be accompanied by alcohol-dependence treatment to lower more severe FASD forms. © The Author 2011.

N2  - Conceptualizations of risks related to women's alcohol use during pregnancy, and the attendant response to preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), are examined in six countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Uganda, Uruguay, and China. Considerable differences were found in how risks were conceptualized across countries and in contextual factors that influence research, prevention, and intervention efforts. Differences in conceptualizations were also apparent within countries. Differences also existed in the degree to which the issue of drinking during pregnancy has been minimized or amplified and in whether and how responses are linked to treatment or other public health interventions.

N2  - An alcohol-server training program to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome was developed, implemented, and evaluated in a comparison study of public drinking establishments in New Mexico and Oregon. The management and serving staffs of 148 establishments licensed for on-premise alcohol sales in the two states studied were trained to discourage alcohol consumption by pregnant customers. Pre- and post-tests of server responses to pregnant-appearing "pseudo-patron" actors ordering alcohol in experimental (n = 148) and comparison (n = 183) establishments were a key method of evaluating the efficacy of this intervention. Within-group chi-square analyses compared rates of service refusal at baseline with 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up points for both the trained (experimental) and the comparison establishments. No differences were found between experimental and comparison establishments at baseline at either site, but significant differences were found for New Mexico at each posttraining measurement point. In Oregon, the refusal rate at baseline increased from 1.5% at baseline to 8.3% at 1 month, which only approached significance. In New Mexico, at baseline the refusal rate was 8.6%, and it rose to 39.2% at 6 months (p < .0001, odds ratio = 6.83) and remained high at 28.2% at 12 months (p < .001, odds ratio = 4.15). No similarly significant gains were recorded at control establishments. Supplemental responsible beverage service training for alcohol servers to aid in the prevention of fetal alcohol exposure can be effective in reducing the serving of alcohol to visibly pregnant women, with robust effects continuing over the subsequent year in the New Mexico establishments.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a syndrome that results from prenatal alcohol exposure and is defined by significant neurobehavioral impairments. Sleep disruption has been recognized as a clinically important symptom of FASD that has multiple negative effects on the child's health, ability to function adaptively, as well as on family and caregivers. However, few studies have addressed and characterized the sleep problems in this population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize sleep in FASD and describe the impact of sensory processing difficulties on sleep patterns in children with FASD. METHODS: Children with FASD were compared with age-matched typically developing children between 3 and 6 years of age. Sleep was assessed using actigraphy, a sleep log, and the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire. The Sensory Profile, completed by caregivers, was used to evaluate the child's sensory processing abilities. Overall differences in sensory processing were correlated with actigraphic parameters measured in alcohol exposed and control groups. RESULTS: Data show that children with FASD have significantly more sleep disturbances than typically developing children, including increased bedtime resistance, shortened sleep duration, increased sleep anxiety, and increased night awakenings and parasomnias. Actigraphy reveals a significant difference between groups for sleep onset latency. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that sensory processing deficits are widespread in children with FASD and that these deficits are associated with multiple sleep problems. Children with FASD should be screened for sleep-related disorders and would benefit from occupational therapy for sensory-based treatment aimed at sleep regulation and consolidation. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - When fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was initially described, diagnosis was based upon physical parameters including facial anomalies and growth retardation, with evidence of developmental delay or mental deficiency. Forty years of research has shown that FAS lies towards the extreme end of what are now termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The most profound effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are on the developing brain and the cognitive and behavioral effects that ensue. Alcohol exposure affects brain development via numerous pathways at all stages from neurogenesis to myelination. For example, the same processes that give rise to the facial characteristics of FAS also cause abnormal brain development. Behaviors as diverse as executive functioning to motor control are affected. This special issue of Neuropsychology Review addresses these changes in brain and behavior highlighting the relationship between the two. A diagnostic goal is to recognize FAS as a disorder of brain rather than one of physical characteristics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

T1  - Functional neuroimaging in the examination of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Coles C.D.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Functional neuroimaging offers the opportunity to understand the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the activities of the brain as well as providing a window into the relationship between neural activation and the behavioral outcomes that have been described in affected individuals. Several different methodologies have been used to examine the neurophysiological signal changes associated with different brain functions in prenatally exposed individuals and those diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These include electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These studies demonstrate that it is feasible to use these technologies with this clinical population and that the damage to the central nervous system associated with prenatal alcohol exposure has widespread functional implications; however, currently, the literature in these areas is limited and unsystematic. Functional MRI with this clinical population has just begun to explore the implications of prenatal alcohol exposure with the first paper published in 2005. Other methodologies are similarly limited in scope. Nonetheless, these functional neuroimaging studies suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure, or a diagnosis of FAS, may lead to restrictions in neural efficiency or a global decrement in processing resources. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - The characteristic facial features of the more severe end of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) include smooth philtrum, thin vermillion of the upper lip, and short palpebral fissures. A systematic evaluation of a comprehensive list of minor structural defects in association with varying patterns of prenatal exposure to alcohol has not been performed. We examined the patterns and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure to minor structural malformations occurring in at least 5% of the sample. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0-6 weeks post-conception, 6-12 weeks post-conception, first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester. Naevus flammeus neonatorum is significantly associated with various patterns of drinking during the second half of the first trimester (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04, 1.24 for average number of drinks per day; RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.07 for number of binge episodes; RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01, 1.15 for maximum number of drinks in one episode) and similar for number of binge episodes in all categories of timing of exposure and in the second trimester for average number of drinks per day. Other minor malformations occurring in at least 5% of the sample were not found to be significantly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Expected minor malformations were not found to be significantly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Naevus flammeus neonatorum appears to be part of the spectrum of features associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a wide range of neurocognitive effects. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC), which involves temporal pairing of a conditioned with an unconditioned stimulus, has been shown to be a potential biomarker of fetal alcohol exposure. A growing body of evidence suggests that white matter may be a specific target of alcohol teratogenesis, and the neural circuitry underlying EBC is known to involve the cerebellar peduncles. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that has proven useful for assessing central nervous system white matter integrity. This study used DTI to examine the degree to which the fetal alcohol-related deficit in EBC may be mediated by structural impairment in the cerebellar peduncles. Methods: Thirteen children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and 12 matched controls were scanned using DTI and structural MRI sequences. The DTI data were processed using a voxelwise technique, and the structural data were used for volumetric analyses. Prenatal alcohol exposure group and EBC performance were examined in relation to brain volumes and outputs from the DTI analysis. Results: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and perpendicular diffusivity group differences between alcohol-exposed and nonexposed children were identified in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. Alcohol exposure correlated with lower FA and greater perpendicular diffusivity in this region, and these correlations remained significant even after controlling for total brain and cerebellar volumes. Conversely, trace conditioning performance was related to higher FA and lower perpendicular diffusivity in the left middle peduncle. The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on trace conditioning was partially mediated by lower FA in this region. Conclusions: This study extends recent findings that have used DTI to reveal microstructural deficits in white matter in children with FASD. This is the first DTI study to demonstrate mediation of a fetal alcohol-related effect on neuropsychological function by deficits in white matter integrity.

N2  - New patterns of alcohol drinking are leading to a significant increase in alcohol damage. Epidemiological data show lowering age of first alcohol use that in Italy is close to 12 ys, and an increasing number of female drinkers. The latest evidence indicates a higher risk for female pathologies and for alcohol drinking during pregnancy with consequent foetal alcohol exposure. In the western countries, prenatal alcohol exposure is the main preventable cause of mental retardation in children. Alcohol produces negative effects on foetal development globally defined FASD (Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders) and the major consequence is FAS (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). Recent epidemiological studies show that FAS and FASD are present in Italy and are surely underestimated. Some aspects of alcohol-related problems in paediatric age are discussed in the present article together with recent perspectives in the study on new biomarkers. However, prevention is the mainstay where paediatricians may have a pivotal role in recognizing and treating alcohol disease in the newborn and in the early adolescent promptly.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is common with about 80,000 women continuing to drink through all three trimesters of pregnancy each year. PAE is also associated with postnatal adversities, including abuse and neglect, which increase risk for foster care placement. Each day 700 children enter the foster care system. A diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) also increases the risk for foster care placement. Among children diagnosed with FASD 70% are or have been in foster care. FASD prevalence rates are increased 10- to 15-fold in foster care systems. Foster care is an important opportunity to detect FASD and provide services to infants and children with FASD. FASD is the third most common identifiable cause of mental retardation in the United States. We describe a court-team-based model of care developed to improve management of children with PAE or FASD entering foster care. The programmatic objectives include: enhancing detection of PAE; screening for FASD; increased consideration of FASD as a potential issue in treatment planning with foster parents; improved entry into treatment; and increased surveillance for parents with an FASD. © 2011 by Federal Legal Publications, Inc.

T1  - The criminal justice system's disparate treatment of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in cases involving sexual activity
A1  - Mcmurtrie J.
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are treated differently by the criminal justice system in sex offense prosecutions, depending upon whether they are categorized as victims or perpetrators. The primary and secondary disabilities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure are often taken into consideration when assessing the capacity of a victim to consent to sexual activity, but generally not considered in determining whether a defendant had the mens rea to engage in criminal sexual conduct. This article traces the historical underpinnings of the mens rea requirement in criminal law and discusses its elimination in most prosecutions for statutory rape. The article recommends that additional research be conducted to determine the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on an individual's capacity to consent to sexual activity. It suggests that fundamental principles of culpability require an examination of how FASD impacts an individual's capacity to engage in meaningful, responsible, decision making about sexual activity before criminal sanctions are imposed. © 2011 by Federal Legal Publications, Inc.

T1  - Childhood behavioural and developmental disorders - association with maternal alcohol consumption in Cape Town, South Africa

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Current maternal alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, is strongly associated with childhood behavioural and/or developmental disorders (BDDs) in a population attending tertiary hospital ambulatory services. BDDs were also associated with maternal alcohol use 6 months before pregnancy. An association with BDDs could not be conclusively demonstrated for drinking during pregnancy, but this may have been influenced by underreporting and reduced study power due to misclassification of exposure. We cannot rule out the a priori suspicion that some mild BDDs in children in the Western Cape could be undiagnosed fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Nonetheless, the study highlighted the important impact of current maternal alcohol use on behaviour and development of children. Future research on the impact of maternal alcohol use on childhood development should include examination of environmental and social factors contributing to this increased risk. Upstream interventions aimed at reducing alcohol-related harms may also contribute to reducing the burden of BDDs.

N2  - The knowledge of the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy isn't indeed a new issue, but the recent evidences of ethyl-glucuronide and ethyl-sulfate in meconium as novel biomarkers of prenatal ethanol exposure open new perspectives for the early diagnosis of the alcohol-related birth defects. This is crucial for a better developmental outcome of the affected patients and for preventing additional cases in at risk families. The fetal alcohol syndrome is not a single entity but represents the most severe form of a spectrum of disorders, including distinctive craniofacial alterations, stunted growth and behavioral abnormalities, caused by complex gene-environment interactions. FAS must always be a diagnosis of exclusion and have to be differentiated from many conditions caused by other embryotoxin agents and genetic syndromes that share some phenotypic features. Even if the first trimester is considered the most vulnerable period, nowadays is known that a fetal damage might occur throughout all gestation. Since ethanol consumption is constantly increasing among young women, a substantial amount of work has to be made to implement the knowledge on alcohol fetal effects among women of childbearing age; moreover, awareness and training among professionals in the health care system might play a critical role in the early diagnosis of these serious conditions. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Background. High numbers of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) have been described as having mental health problems. Aims.This article summarizes research about mental health problems in FASD and considers related developmental and environmental issues. Method. A computer-based literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Academic Search Complete, and Education Resources Information Centre for articles addressing the prevalence and types of mental health issues in individuals affected by FASD. Results. High rates of mental disorders within the FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) population were found to be consistently reported for both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Moreover, problems that emerge in childhood may reflect a convergence of genetic, environmental, and neurophysiological factors that persist into adulthood. Conclusions. Researchers are beginning to document the impacts of PAE on later mental health development. Further longitudinal study is needed to determine whether there is an increasing severity of mental health deficits and consequences with age, and whether any such changes reflect increasingly deteriorating environmental factors or brain-based factors. Additionally, research is needed to design interventions to better address the unique mental health needs of this population. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Ethanol-induced neuro-developmental abnormalities are associated with impaired insulin and IGF signaling, and increased oxidative stress in CNS neurons. We examined the roles of ethanol and its principal toxic metabolite, acetaldehyde, as mediators of impaired insulin/IGF signaling and oxidative injury in immature cerebellar neurons. Cultures were exposed to 3.5mM acetaldehyde or 50mM ethanol +/- 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), an inhibitor of ethanol metabolism, and viability, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and insulin responsiveness were measured 48 hours later. Acetaldehyde or ethanol increased neuronal death and levels of 8-OHdG and 4-HNE, and reduced mitochondrial function. Ethanol inhibited insulin responsiveness, whereas acetaldehyde did not. 4-MP abated ethanol-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, but failed to restore insulin responsiveness. Furthermore, alcohol and aldehyde metabolizing enzyme genes were inhibited by prenatal ethanol exposure; this effect was mediated by acetaldehyde and not ethanol + 4MP. These findings suggest that brain insulin resistance in prenatal alcohol exposure is caused by direct effects of ethanol, whereas oxidative stress induced neuronal injury is likely mediated by ethanol and its toxic metabolites. Moreover, the adverse effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on brain development may be exacerbated by down-regulation of genes needed for metabolism and detoxification of alcohol in the brain.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) occurs in children of mothers consuming alcohol during pregnancy. The recent statement of NOFAS (National Organization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) and FASD Center of Excellence in Washington DC of April 15th, 2004 has the following wording: "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a broad term describing a wide range of developmental outcomes among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure. The outcomes may include physical, mental, cognitive and behavioural anomalies; and they may persist across the lifespan. The term FASD is not intended for use as a clinical diagnosis". As a result of alcohol intoxication during the prenatal development the fetus is damaged at the cellular level, which results in a malformation of the central nervous system and internal organs. The most dangerous consequence of the prenatal alcohol damage is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Developmental disorders of children with FASD occur in different areas. These include: abnormal cognitive development (problems with memory, hyper-activity, planning, anticipation, skills learning), problems with emotions, especially in social situations (withdrawal or aggression, a tendency to steal and lie, avoidance of responsibility, credulity, over-confidence and lack of reflection). Currently used diagnostic criteria are still based on the triad of the following clinical symptoms: 1. characteristic facial features; 1. growth deficiency; 1. central nervous system abnormalities. The outcomes of the teratogenic (toxic for fetus) impact of alcohol exposure depend on the following: * Amount of alcohol (Note! Even a very small amount of alcohol may in certain circumstances be dangerous). * Phase of pregnancy - in each trimester some specific damage typical for a given moment of fetus development may take place. In the first trimester alcohol exposure can lead to growth retardation and development of dysmorphia, in the second and third trimester the central nervous system is mostly vulnerable and there is a disturbed neurotransmitters production. * Mother's general health condition (nutritional status, genetic predisposition, immune system). Children of drinking mothers who did not present all the symptoms of damage (dysmorphia) were initially described as the FAE children (fetal alcohol effects). The aim of this study is to analyse the clinical picture of depression on the basis of the case of a 12-year-old boy. The authors describe the symptoms presented by him and give understanding of the patient in the individual context, as well as in relationship with his mother, and discuss his drawing. They propose a psychotherapy treatment.

N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to ethanol can produce a complex set of effects on fetal development, which is denominated fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Early detection of ethanol exposure can allow the prevention of some relevant adverse effects associated to FASD. Objectives: The aim of this work was to review the main toxic effects of ethanol on the neonate and the available biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: A bibliographic search was performed in PubMed employing the terms "effects maternal ethanol exposure" and "biomarkers ethanol prenatal exposure" and cross references. Results: Many adverse effects on fetal development were described, especially deficits in the central nervous system. The biomarkers of ethanol exposure more widely described were fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS), being meconium and hair the most common biological matrices for laboratorial evaluation. Discussion: The early detection of alcohol exposure in intra-uterine life is useful to prevent the secondary effects of FASD through pharmacologic and educational intervention in affected children.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is thought to be the most prevalent nongenetic cause of a wide range of neurodevelopmental deficits. Insufficient thyroid hormone levels are one mechanism that hampers development of the alcohol-exposed brain, and we hypothesized that altered dosage of the imprinted thyroid hormone-inactivating gene deiodinase-III (Dio3) is responsible. To follow parent-of-origin allelic expression of Dio3 in the fetal and adult offspring of alcohol-consuming and control dams, we reciprocally crossed 2 polymorphic rat strains. In the frontal cortex, prenatal alcohol exposure altered imprinting patterns and total expression of Dio3 in the fetus and produced a permanent hypothyroid milieu in the adult. In the hippocampus, alcohol affected the paternal and total expression of Dio3 in the fetus and in the adult male, where thyroid hormone levels were concomitantly increased. Hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits were identified exclusively in males, suggesting they are dependent on aberrant allelic Dio3 expression. None of these effects were observed in offspring of the reciprocal cross. Thus, genetic background and sex modify vulnerability to prenatal alcohol via brain region-specific expression of Dio3. This finding implies that phenotypic heterogeneity in human fetal alcohol spectrum disorder can be linked to genetic vulnerability in affected brain regions. © FASEB.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a range of disabilities caused by gestational exposure of the fetus to alcohol. Alcohol consumption in Israel has increased dramatically in the last decades. Our previous study revealed limited knowledge among Israeli medical professionals of the risks and potential long-term effects of FASD. Objectives: To evaluate the awareness and knowledge of women regarding the current recommendations on alcohol consumption during pregnancy, evaluate how many of the women received information regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy from medical professionals, and their personal drinking habits during pregnancy. Methods: A cross-sectional sample of new mothers in 3 large hospitals in Israel were asked to complete an ad hoc questionnaire on aspects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results: A total of 3815 women of mean age 30.4 years participated in the study; 82% were Jewish. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported by 14.1%, including more than 17% of the Jewish women, 11.1% of the Christian women, and none of the Muslim women. Rates were higher among nonsecular and younger women and first-time mothers. 71.6% of the sample claimed that women should not drink alcohol at all during pregnancy, and 21.4% thought that it was permissible if limited to 2 drinks per week. Seventy-five percent had received no formal information from medical professionals regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Conclusions: Alcohol consumption is frequent among pregnant women in Israel, especially young secular Jewish women with first pregnancies. Improved educational programs on the dangers of FASD are needed for both professionals and the general public. © 2011 Canadian Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. All rights reserved.

T1  - Molecular and behavioral aspects of the actions of alcohol on the adult and developing brain

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The brain is one of the major target organs of alcohol actions. Alcohol abuse can lead to alterations in brain structure and functions and, in some cases, to neurodegeneration. Cognitive deficits and alcohol dependence are highly damaging consequences of alcohol abuse. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to alcohol, and that drinking during gestation can lead to a range of physical, learning and behavioral defects (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders), with the most dramatic presentation corresponding to fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent findings also indicate that adolescence is a stage of brain maturation and that heavy drinking at this stage can have a negative impact on brain structure and functions causing important short-and long-term cognitive and behavioral consequences. The effects of alcohol on the brain are not uniform; some brain areas or cell populations are more vulnerable than others. The prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, the white matter and glial cells are particularly susceptible to the effects of ethanol. The molecular actions of alcohol on the brain are complex and involve numerous mechanisms and signaling pathways. Some of the mechanisms involved are common for the adult brain and for the developing brain, while others depend on the developmental stage. During brain ontogeny, alcohol causes irreversible alterations to the brain structure. It also impairs several molecular, neurochemical and cellular events taking place during normal brain development, including alterations in both gene expression regulation and the molecules involved in cella"cell interactions, interference with the mitogenic and growth factor response, enhancement of free radical formation and derangements of glial cell functions. However, in both adult and adolescent brains, alcohol damages specific brain areas through mechanisms involving excitotoxicity, free radical formation and neuroinflammatory damage resulting from activation of the innate immune system mediated by TLR4 receptors. Alcohol also acts on specific membrane proteins, such as neurotransmitter receptors (e.g. NMDA, GABA-A), ion channels (e.g. L-type Ca2+ channels, GIRKs), and signaling pathways (e.g. PKA and PKC signaling). These effects might underlie the wide variety of behavioral effects induced by ethanol drinking. The neuroadaptive changes affecting neurotransmission systems which are more sensitive to the acute effects of alcohol occur after long-term alcohol consumption. Alcohol-induced maladaptations in the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, abnormal plastic changes in the reward-related brain areas and genetic and epigenetic factors may all contribute to alcohol reinforcement and alcohol addiction. This manuscript reviews the mechanisms by which ethanol impacts the adult and the developing brain, and causes both neural impairments and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. The identification and the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ethanol toxicity might contribute to the development of treatments and/or therapeutic agents that could reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of alcohol on the brain. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a range of disabilities caused by gestational exposure of the fetus to alcohol. Alcohol consumption in Israel has increased dramatically in the last decades. Our previous study revealed limited knowledge among Israeli medical professionals of the risks and potential long-term effects of FASD. Objectives To evaluate the awareness and knowledge of women regarding the current recommendations on alcohol consumption during pregnancy, evaluate how many of the women received information regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy from medical professionals, and their personal drinking habits during pregnancy. Methods A cross-sectional sample of new mothers in 3 large hospitals in Israel were asked to complete an ad hoc questionnaire on aspects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results A total of 3815 women of mean age 30.4 years participated in the study; 82% were Jewish. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported by 14.1%, including more than 17% of the Jewish women, 11.1% of the Christian women, and none of the Muslim women. Rates were higher among nonsecular and younger women and first-time mothers. 71.6% of the sample claimed that women should not drink alcohol at all during pregnancy, and 21.4% thought that it was permissible if limited to 2 drinks per week. Seventy-five percent had received no formal information from medical professionals regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Conclusions Alcohol consumption is frequent among pregnant women in Israel, especially young secular Jewish women with first pregnancies. Improved educational programs on the dangers of FASD are needed for both professionals and the general public. ©2011 Canadian Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics All rights reserved.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is a major, preventable cause of behavioral and cognitive deficits in children. Despite extensive research, a unique neurobehavioral profile for children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure remains elusive. A fundamental question that must be addressed is how genetic and environmental factors interact with gestational alcohol exposure to produce neurobehavioral and neurobiological deficits in children. The core objectives of the NeuroDevNet team in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is to create an integrated research program of basic and clinical investigations that will (1) identify genetic and epigenetic modifications that may be predictive of the neurobehavioral and neurobiological dysfunctions in offspring induced by gestational alcohol exposure and (2) determine the relationship between structural alterations in the brain induced by gestational alcohol exposure and functional outcomes in offspring. The overarching hypothesis to be tested is that neurobehavioral and neurobiological dysfunctions induced by gestational alcohol exposure are correlated with the genetic background of the affected child and/or epigenetic modifications in gene expression. The identification of genetic and/or epigenetic markers that are predictive of the severity of behavioral and cognitive deficits in children affected by gestational alcohol exposure will have a profound impact on our ability to identify children at risk. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Little is known about alcohol effects on the utero-placental compartment during pregnancy. For the first time, we utilized 2-D DIGE quantitative proteomics to evaluate the role of the uterus in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) pathogenesis. Uterine artery endothelial cells were isolated from pregnant ewes, FAC sorted, validated, and maintained in culture. To mimic maternal binge drinking patterns, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of alcohol (300. mg/dl) in a compensating sealed humidified chamber system equilibrated with aqueous alcohol for 3. h on 3 consecutive days for two weeks. CyDye switch combined with 2-D DIGE followed by MALDI-TOF and tandem MS/MS were utilized. Validation was performed using Western immunoblot analysis. Chronic binge-like alcohol significantly (P<0.05) decreased 30 proteins and increased 19 others. Gene-enrichment and functional annotation cluster analysis revealed significant enrichment (P<0.05) in three categories: glutathione S transferase, thioredoxin, and vesicle transport-related. Furthermore, alcohol differentially altered proteins with certain isoforms being downregulated while others were upregulated. In summary, binge alcohol has specific effects on the maternal uterine proteome, especially those related to oxidative stress. The current study also demonstrates a great need to utilize proteomic approaches for diagnostic, mechanistic and therapeutic aspects of FASD. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Children whose mothers consumed alcohol during pregnancy exhibit widespread brain abnormalities and a complex array of behavioral disturbances. Here, we used a mouse model of fetal alcohol exposure to investigate relationships between brain abnormalities and specific behavioral alterations during adulthood. Results: Mice drank a 10% ethanol solution throughout pregnancy. When fetal alcohol-exposed offspring reached adulthood, we used high resolution MRI to conduct a brain-wide screen for structural changes and found that the largest reduction in volume occurred in the olfactory bulbs. Next, we tested adult mice in an associative olfactory task and found that fetal alcohol exposure impaired discrimination between similar odors but left odor memory intact. Finally, we investigated olfactory bulb neurogenesis as a potential mechanism by performing an in vitro neurosphere assay, in vivo labeling of new cells using BrdU, and in vivo labeling of new cells using a transgenic reporter system. We found that fetal alcohol exposure decreased the number of neural precursor cells in the subependymal zone and the number of new cells in the olfactory bulbs during the first few postnatal weeks. Conclusions: Using a combination of techniques, including structural brain imaging, in vitro and in vivo cell detection methods, and behavioral testing, we found that fetal alcohol exposure results in smaller olfactory bulbs and impairments in odor discrimination that persist into adulthood. Furthermore, we found that these abnormalities in olfactory bulb structure and function may arise from deficits in the generation of new olfactory bulb neurons during early postnatal development. © 2011 Akers et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Regional cortical thickness was evaluated using CIVET processing of 3D T1-weighted images (i) to compare the variation in cortical thickness between 33 participants with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) aged 6-30 years (mean age 12.3. years) versus 33 age/sex/hand-matched controls, and (ii) to examine developmental changes in cortical thickness with age from children to young adults in both groups. Significant cortical thinning was found in the participants with FASD in large areas of the bilateral middle frontal lobe, pre- and post- central areas, lateral and inferior temporal and occipital lobes compared to controls. No significant cortical thickness increases were observed for the FASD group. Cortical thinning with age in a linear model was observed in both groups, but the locations were different for each group. FASD participants showed thinning with age in the left middle frontal, bilateral precentral, bilateral precuneus and paracingulate, left inferior occipital and bilateral fusiform gyri; while controls showed decreases with age in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precuneus gyrus, and bilateral occipital gyrus. A battery of cognitive assessments of memory, attention, motor, and verbal abilities was conducted with many of the FASD participants, but no significant correlations were found between these cognitive scores and regional cortical thickness. Non-invasive measurements of cortical thickness in children to young adults with FASD have identified both key regions of cortex that may be more deleteriously affected by prenatal alcohol exposure as well as cortical changes with age that differ from normal developmental thinning. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy causes a continuum of long-lasting disabilities in the offspring, commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is possibly the most common behavioral problem in children with FASD and devising strategies that ameliorate this condition has great clinical relevance. Studies in rodent models of ADHD and FASD suggest that impairments in the cAMP signaling cascade contribute to the hyperactivity phenotype. In this work, we investigated whether the cAMP levels are affected in a long-lasting manner by ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent period of human gestation and whether the acute administration of the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine ameliorates the ethanol-induced hyperactivity. Methods: From postnatal day (P) 2 to P8, Swiss mice either received ethanol (5. g/kg i.p.) or saline every other day. At P30, the animals either received vinpocetine (20. mg/kg or 10. mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle 4. h before being tested in the open field. After the test, frontal cerebral cortices and hippocampi were dissected and collected for assessment of cAMP levels. Results: Early alcohol exposure significantly increased locomotor activity in the open field and reduced cAMP levels in the hippocampus. The acute treatment of ethanol-exposed animals with 20. mg/kg of vinpocetine restored both their locomotor activity and cAMP levels to control levels. Conclusions: These data lend support to the idea that cAMP signaling system contribute to the hyperactivity induced by developmental alcohol exposure and provide evidence for the potential therapeutic use of vinpocetine in FASD. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Aim: To examine risk and protective factors associated with behavioural problems of children and adolescents following prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: A total of 73 children and adolescents with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were assessed for internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems using the Child Behavior Checklist. Linear regression models were used to determine the effects of diagnostic and environmental risk and protective factors on behaviour, while controlling for age, sex and IQ. Results: Length of time spent in residential care was the most pervasive risk factor associated with internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems. A low dysmorphology score was related to more internalizing and total problems. Conclusions: Children and adolescents prenatally exposed to alcohol faced greater risk of substantive behavioural problems (i) if they were less visibly alcohol affected and (ii) the longer time they had spent in residential care. The results underscore the clinical importance of appropriate services and care for less visibly affected children with FASD and highlight the need to attend to children with FASD being raised in institutions. © 2011 The Author(s)/Acta Paediatrica © 2011 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

N2  - Background: Ethanol consumption during pregnancy can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which consists of the complete spectrum of developmental deficits including neurological dysfunction. FASD is associated with a variety of neurobehavioral disturbances dependent on the age and duration of exposure. Ethanol exposure in neonatal rodents can also induce widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration and long-lasting behavioral abnormalities similar to FASD. The developmental stage of neonatal rodent brains that are at the peak of synaptogenesis is equivalent to the third trimester of human gestation. Methods: Male and female C57BL/6By mice were injected with ethanol (20%, 2.5g/kg, 2 s.c. injections) or an equal volume of saline (controls) on postnatal day 7 (P7). Animals were allowed to mature and at 3months were tested on an olfactory habituation task known to be dependent on piriform cortex function, a hippocampal-dependent object place memory task, and used for electrophysiological testing of spontaneous and odor-evoked local field potential (LFP) activity in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and dorsal hippocampus. Results: P7 ethanol induced widespread cell death within 1day of exposure, with highest levels in the neocortex, intermediate levels in the dorsal hippocampus, and relatively low levels in the primary olfactory system. No impairment of odor investigation or odor habituation was detected in P7 ethanol-exposed 3-month-old mice compared to saline controls. However, hippocampal-dependent object place memory was significantly impaired in the P7 ethanol-treated adult mice. Odor-evoked LFP activity was enhanced throughout the olfacto-hippocampal pathway, primarily within the theta frequency band, although the hippocampus also showed elevated evoked delta frequency activity. In addition, functional coherence between the piriform cortex and olfactory bulb and between the piriform cortex and dorsal hippocampus was enhanced in the beta frequency range in P7 ethanol-treated adult mice compared to controls. Conclusions: P7 ethanol induces an immediate wave of regionally selective cell death followed by long-lasting changes in local circuit and regional network function that are accompanied by changes in neurobehavioral performance. The results suggest that both the activity of local neural circuits within a brain region and the flow of information between brain regions can be modified by early alcohol exposure, which may contribute to long-lasting behavioral abnormalities known to rely on those circuits. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Previous research in South Africa revealed very high rates of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), of 46-89 per 1000 among young children. Maternal and child data from studies in this community summarize the multiple predictors of FAS and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS). Method: Sequential regression was employed to examine influences on child physical characteristics and dysmorphology from four categories of maternal traits: physical, demographic, childbearing, and drinking. Then, a structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to predict influences on child physical characteristics. Results: Individual sequential regressions revealed that maternal drinking measures were the most powerful predictors of a child's physical anomalies (R2=30, p<.001), followed by maternal demographics (R2=24, p<.001), maternal physical characteristics (R2=15, p<.001), and childbearing variables (R2=06, p<.001). The SEM utilized both individual variables and the four composite categories of maternal traits to predict a set of child physical characteristics, including a total dysmorphology score. As predicted, drinking behavior is a relatively strong predictor of child physical characteristics (beta=0.61, p<.001), even when all other maternal risk variables are included; higher levels of drinking predict child physical anomalies. Conclusions: Overall, the SEM model explains 62% of the variance in child physical anomalies. As expected, drinking variables explain the most variance. But this highly controlled estimation of multiple effects also reveals a significant contribution played by maternal demographics and, to a lesser degree, maternal physical and childbearing variables. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Alcohol and maternal uterine vascular adaptations during pregnancy-Part I: Effects of chronic in vitro binge-like alcohol on uterine endothelial nitric oxide system and function

N2  - Background: Pregnancy-induced utero-placental growth, angiogenic remodeling, and enhanced vasodilation are all partly regulated by estradiol-17beta-mediated activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production. However, very little is known about the effects of alcohol on these maternal utero-placental vascular adaptations during pregnancy and its potential role in the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In this study, we hypothesized that in vitro chronic binge-like alcohol will decrease uterine arterial endothelial eNOS expression and alter its multisite phosphorylation activity state via disruption of AKT signaling. To study the direct effects of alcohol on uterine vascular adaptations, we further investigated the effects of alcohol on estradiol-17beta-induced uterine angiogenesis in vitro. Methods: Uterine artery endothelial cells were isolated from pregnant ewes (gestational day 120 to 130; term=147), fluorescence-activated cell sorted, validated, and maintained in culture to passage 4. To mimic maternal binge drinking patterns, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of a lower (LD) or higher dose (HD) of alcohol in a compensating sealed humidified chamber system equilibrated with aqueous alcohol for 3hours on 3 consecutive days. Immunoblotting was performed to assess expression of NO system-associated proteins and eNOS multi-site phosphorylation. Following this treatment paradigm, control and binge alcohol-treated cells were passaged, grown for 2days, and then treated with increasing concentrations of estradiol-17beta (0.1, 1, 10, 100nM) in the absence or presence of LD or HD alcohol to evaluate estradiol-17beta-induced angiogenesis index using BrdU proliferation assay. Results: LD and HD binge-like alcohol decreased uterine arterial eNOS expression (p=0.009). eNOS multisite phosphorylation activation state was altered: P635eNOS was decreased (p=0.017), P1177eNOS was not altered, and P495eNOS exhibited an inverse U-shaped dose-dependent relationship with alcohol. LD and HD alcohol decreased the major eNOS-associated protein cav-1 (p<0.001). However, the commonly implicated AKT pathway did not correlate with eNOS posttranslational modifications. Assessment of uterine vascular adaptation via angiogenesis demonstrated that alcohol abrogated the dose-dependent proliferative effects of estradiol-17beta and thus blunted angiogenesis. Conclusions: Thus, the maternal uterine vasculature during pregnancy may be vulnerable to chronic binge-like alcohol. Altered eNOS multisite phosphorylation also suggests that alcohol produces specific effects at the level of posttranslational modifications critical for pregnancy-induced uterine vascular adaptations. Finally, the alcohol and estradiol-17beta data suggest a negative impact of alcohol on estrogen actions on the uterine vasculature. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in varying degrees of neurodevelopmental deficits, growth retardation, and facial dysmorphology. Variation in these adverse outcomes not only depends on the dose and pattern of alcohol exposure but also on less well understood interactions among environmental, genetic, and maternal factors. The current study tested the hypothesis that fetal genotype is an important determinant of ethanol teratogenesis by evaluating effects of ethanol exposure via embryo culture in 3 inbred strains of mice known to differ in the vulnerability of prenatal alcohol exposure in vivo. Methods: Three strains of mice, C57BL/6N (B6), DBA/2 (D2), and 129S6/SvEvTac (129S6) were assessed in a whole embryo culture beginning on embryonic day 8.25, with or without alcohol administration at 88mM for 6hours followed by 42hours culture in ethanol-free media. Results: Contrasting strain differences in susceptibility were observed for the brain, the face, and other organ systems using the Maele-Fabry and Picard scoring system. The forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, heart, optic vesicle, caudal neural tube, and hindlimbs of the B6 mice were severely delayed in growth, whereas compared to the respective controls, only the forebrain and optic vesicle were delayed in the D2 mice, and no effects were found in the 129S6 mice. A large number of cleaved (c)-caspase 3 positive (+) cells were found in regions of the brain, optic vesicles, cranial nerve nuclei V, VII, VIII, and IX as well as the craniofacial primordial; only a few were found in corresponding regions of the B6 controls. In contrast, only a small number of c-caspase 3 immunostaining cells were found in either the alcohol treated or the controls of the D2 embryos and in 129S6 embryos. The independent apoptotic markers TUNEL and Nile blue staining further confirmed the strain differences in apoptotic responses in both the neural tube and craniofacial primordia. Conclusions: Under embryo culture conditions, in which alcohol exposure factors and fetal developmental staging were controlled, and maternal and intrauterine factors were eliminated, the degree of growth retardation and the extent and type of neurodevelopmental teratogenesis varied significantly across strains. Notably, the 129S6 strain was remarkably resistant to alcohol-induced growth deficits, confirming a previous in vivo study, and the D2 strain was also significantly less affected than the B6 strain. These findings demonstrate that fetal genotype is an important factor that can contribute to the variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have deficits in verbal learning and recall. However, the specificity of these deficits has not been adequately tested. In the current study, verbal learning and memory performance of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was compared to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a disorder commonly seen in alcohol-exposed children. Methods: Performance on the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C) was examined in 3 groups of children (N=22/group): (i) heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD (ALC), (ii) nonexposed with ADHD (ADHD), and (iii) nonexposed typically developing (CON). Groups were matched on age, sex, race, ethnicity, handedness, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results: Group differences were noted on learning trials (CON>ADHD>ALC). On the delayed recall trial, CON children performed better than both clinical groups, who did not differ from each other. Children in the ALC group demonstrated poorer recognition than children in the CON and ADHD groups, who did not differ from each other. Marginally significant group differences were noted on retention of previously learned material. Post hoc analyses indicated that ADHD children showed worse retention relative to the CON group, whereas retention in the ALC children remained intact. Conclusions: These data suggest that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and nonexposed children with ADHD show differential patterns of deficit on the CVLT-C. Performance of alcohol-exposed children reflects inefficient encoding of verbal material, whereas performance of the ADHD group may be better characterized by a deficit in retrieval of learned material. Differences noted between clinical groups add to a growing neurobehavioral profile of FASD that may aid in differential diagnosis. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: MRI studies, including recent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies, have shown corpus callosum abnormalities in children prenatally exposed to alcohol, especially in the posterior regions. These abnormalities appear across the range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have demonstrated cognitive correlates of callosal abnormalities in FASD including deficits in visual-motor skill, verbal learning, and executive functioning. The goal of this study was to determine whether inter-hemispheric structural connectivity abnormalities in FASD are associated with disrupted inter-hemispheric functional connectivity and disrupted cognition. Methods: Twenty-one children with FASD and 23 matched controls underwent a 6-minute resting-state functional MRI scan as well as anatomical imaging and DTI. Using a semi-automated method, we parsed the corpus callosum and delineated 7 inter-hemispheric white matter tracts with DTI tractography. Cortical regions of interest (ROIs) at the distal ends of these tracts were identified. Right-left correlations in resting fMRI signal were computed for these sets of ROIs, and group comparisons were made. Correlations with facial dysmorphology, cognition, and DTI measures were computed. Results: A significant group difference in inter-hemispheric functional connectivity was seen in a posterior set of ROIs, the para-central region. Children with FASD had functional connectivity that was 12% lower than in controls in this region. Subgroup analyses were not possible owing to small sample size, but the data suggest that there were effects across the FASD spectrum. No significant association with facial dysmorphology was found. Para-central functional connectivity was significantly correlated with DTI mean diffusivity, a measure of microstructural integrity, in posterior callosal tracts in controls but not in FASD. Significant correlations were seen between these structural and functional measures, and Wechsler perceptual reasoning ability. Conclusions: Inter-hemispheric functional connectivity disturbances were observed in children with FASD relative to controls. The disruption was measured in medial parietal regions (para-central) that are connected by posterior callosal fiber projections. We have previously shown microstructural abnormalities in these same posterior callosal regions, and the current study suggests a possible relationship between the two. These measures have clinical relevance as they are associated with cognitive functioning. Copyright © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to neurodevelopmental impairments and disrupt several neurotransmitter systems. We examined the timing of moderate level alcohol exposure, serotonin transporter gene polymorphic region variation (rh5-HTTLPR), and levels of primary serotonin and dopamine (DA) metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in rhesus monkeys. Methods: Thirty-two 30-month old rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from 4 groups of females were assessed: (i) early alcohol-exposed group (n=9), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6g/kg/d alcohol solution on gestational days 0 to 50; (ii) middle-to-late gestation alcohol-exposed group (n=6), mothers consumed 0.6g/kg/d alcohol solution on gestational days 50 to 135; (iii) a continuous-exposure group (n=8), mothers consumed 0.6g/kg/d alcohol solution on gestational days 0 to 135; and (iv) controls (n=9), mothers consumed an isocaloric control solution on gestational days 0 to 50, 50 to 135, or 0 to 135. Serotonin transporter promoter region allelic variants (homozygous s/s or heterozygous s/l vs. homozygous l/l) were determined. We examined CSF concentrations of the 5-HT and DA metabolites, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), respectively, at baseline and 50hours after separation from cage-mates, when the monkeys were 30months old. Results: Early- and middle-to-late gestation-alcohol exposed monkeys carrying the short allele had lower concentrations of 5-HIAA in CSF relative to other groups. Concentrations of 5-HIAA in CSF were lower for s allele carriers and increased from baseline relative to pre-separation values, whereas 5-HIAA levels in l/l allele carriers were not affected by separation. Monkeys carrying the short allele had lower basal concentrations of HVA in CSF compared with monkeys homozygous for the long allele. Conclusion: Carrying the s allele of the 5-HT transporter increased the probability of reduced 5-HIAA in early- and middle-to-late gestation alcohol-exposed monkeys and reduced HVA at baseline. These findings that prenatal alcohol exposure altered central 5-HT activity in genetically sensitive monkeys raise questions about whether abnormal serotonin biological pathways could underlie some of the psychiatric disorders reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can damage the developing fetus, illustrated by central nervous system dysfunction and deficits in motor and cognitive abilities. Binge drinking has been associated with an increased risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, likely due to increased episodes of ethanol withdrawal. We hypothesized that overactivity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor during ethanol withdrawal leads to excitotoxic cell death in the developing brain. Consistent with this, administration of NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., MK-801) during withdrawal can attenuate ethanol's teratogenic effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, during ethanol withdrawal could effectively attenuate ethanol-related deficits, without the adverse side effects associated with other NMDA receptor antagonists. Methods: Sprague-Dawley pups were exposed to 6.0g/kg ethanol or isocaloric maltose solution via intubation on postnatal day 6, a period of brain development equivalent to a portion of the 3rd trimester. Twenty-four and 36hours after ethanol, subjects were injected with 0, 10, or 15mg/kg memantine, totaling doses of 0, 20, or 30mg/kg. Motor coordination was tested on a parallel bar task and the total number of cerebellar Purkinje cells was estimated using unbiased stereology. Results: Alcohol exposure induced significant parallel bar motor incoordination and reduced Purkinje cell number. Memantine administration significantly attenuated both ethanol-associated motor deficits and cerebellar cell loss in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: Memantine was neuroprotective when administered during ethanol withdrawal. These data provide further support that ethanol withdrawal contributes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The in vitro generation of neural cells from human embryonic stem cells is a powerful tool to acquire better knowledge of the cellular and molecular events involved in early human neural and brain development under physiological and pathological conditions. Prenatal alcohol exposure can induce important anomalies in the developing brain, the embryogenesis being an important critical period for the craniofacial defects and mental disabilities associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Here, we report the generation of neural progenitors (NPs) from human embryonic stem cells. Neuroepithelial progenitors display the morphological and functional characteristics of their embryonic counterparts and the proper timing of neurons and glia cells generation. Immunocytochemical and real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction analyses reveal that cells appeared as clusters during neuroepithelial cell proliferation and that the genes associated with the neuroectodermal (Pax-6) and the endodermic (alpha-fetoprotein) lineages decreased in parallel to the upregulation of the genes of NPs (nestin and Tuj1), followed by their differentiation into neurons (MAP-2+, GABA+), oligodendrocytes [galactocerebroside (GalC+)], and astrocytes (GFAP+). We further demonstrate, for the first time, that human NPs express the endocannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and the enzymes involved in endocannabinoids synthesis (NAPE-PLD) and degradation (FAAH). Using this in vitro culture, we demonstrate that ethanol exposure impairs NPs survival, affects the differentiation of NPs into neurons and astrocytes, disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, and affects the expression of different genes associated with neural differentiation. The results provide new insights into the effects of ethanol on human embryogenesis and neuroprogenitors and offer an opportunity to delineate potential therapeutic strategies to restore early ethanol-induced brain damage. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background: Although many studies have documented deficits in general motor functioning in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), few have employed detailed measurements to explore the specific nature of such disabilities. This pilot study explores whether three-dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis may generate increased knowledge of the effect of intrauterine alcohol exposure on motor control processes by detecting atypical upper-limb movement pattern specificity in children with FAS relative to typically developing (TD) children.Methods: Left and right arm and head movements during a sequential unimanual goal-directed precision task in a sample of children with FAS and in TD children were registered by an optoelectronic tracking system (ProReflex, Qualisys Inc.).Results: Children with FAS demonstrated evidently poorer task performance compared with TD children. Additionally, analyses of arm movement kinematics revealed atypical spatio-temporal organization in the children with FAS. In general, they exhibited longer arm movement trajectories at both the proximal and distal level, faster velocities at the proximal level but slower at the distal level, and more segmented distal movements. Children with FAS also showed atypically augmented and fast head movements during the task performance.Conclusions: Findings indicate neuromotor deficits and developmental delay in goal-directed arm movements because of prenatal alcohol exposure. It is suggested that 3D kinematic analysis is a valid technique for furthering the understanding of motor control processes in children with FAS/fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. A combination with relevant neuroimaging techniques in future studies would enable a more clear-cut interpretation of how atypical movement patterns relate to underlying brain abnormalities. © 2010 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: In experimental models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), cerebellar hypoplasia and hypofoliation are associated with insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) resistance with impaired signaling through pathways that mediate growth, survival, plasticity, metabolism, and neurotransmitter function. To more directly assess the roles of impaired insulin and IGF signaling during brain development, we administered intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of si-RNA targeting the insulin receptor, (InR), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), or IGF-2R into postnatal day 2 (P2) Long Evans rat pups and examined the sustained effects on cerebellar function, structure, and neurotransmitter-related gene expression (P20). Results: Rotarod tests on P20 demonstrated significant impairments in motor function, and histological studies revealed pronounced cerebellar hypotrophy, hypoplasia, and hypofoliation in si-InR, si-IGF-1R, and si-IGF-2R treated rats. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that si-InR, and to a lesser extent si-IGF-2R, broadly inhibited expression of insulin and IGF-2 polypeptides, and insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 receptors in the brain. ELISA studies showed that si-InR increased cerebellar levels of tau, phospho-tau and beta-actin, and inhibited GAPDH. In addition, si-InR, si-IGF-1R, and si-IGF-2R inhibited expression of choline acetyltransferase, which mediates motor function. Although the ICV si-RNA treatments generally spared the neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor expression, si-InR and si-IGF-1R inhibited NT3, while si-IGF-1R suppressed BDNF. Conclusions: early postnatal inhibition of brain InR expression, and to lesser extents, IGF-R, causes structural and functional abnormalities that resemble effects of FASD. The findings suggest that major abnormalities in brains with FASD are mediated by impairments in insulin/IGF signaling. Potential therapeutic strategies to reduce the long-term impact of prenatal alcohol exposure may include treatment with agents that restore brain insulin and IGF responsiveness. © 2011 de la Monte et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes physical, cognitive and behavioural impairments in the child. Deficits are irreversible and persist into adulthood. It was the objective of this study to investigate the specific problems and challenges faced by young adults with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Patients: We examined the biographical development and living situation of 60 adult patients with FAS. In their childhood, all the patients had been diagnosed with FAS in the Muenster University hospital. Methods: Using a structured interview, we asked for the occupational career, health and social problems as well as the current living conditions of the patients. Results: Most patients lived in dependent circumstances. The occupational development was characterized by disruption and failure, and severe social problems were common in patients. 3 in 4 patients were victims of physical and sexual abuse. Conclusions: Due to the variety of impairments caused by prenatal alcohol exposure and the persisting inability to live independently, adults with FAS need intense care, support and assistance. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart  New York.

N2  - Objective: To assess the awareness and knowledge of pregnant Lebanese women about the risks of drinking during pregnancy and the factors that influence their drinking patterns. Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on a sample of 107 women consulting the gynecology outpatient department of Hotel-Dieu de France in Beirut, Lebanon, who completed the T-ACE screening test included in a 21 multiple choice questionnaire which examine knowledge and beliefs about alcohol use during pregnancy, drinking patterns and awareness of fetal alcohol exposure. Results: The 107 women of our sample were all married, between 20 and 41 years old and had mostly a high educational level (86%). Most of the women (47%) were at their first pregnancy. Of the 20 women who self-reported drinking during pregnancy, 60% obtained a positive score on the T-ACE questionnaire, which indicates that more than 11% of the women engaged with potentially high risk drinking for the baby. There is not a significant difference between the different age categories or educational levels. This proportion is lower than that found in international publications. However, the rate of excessive drinking (4 drinks or more on any one occasion in females) was higher and one woman in five reported excessive drinking in the previous year. There is a high level of knowledge that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the child, and the more consumption the more harmful and likely the effects, but there is confusion about the safety of small amounts of alcohol. Women (37%) think that there is a safe level of drinking during pregnancy; 29% tolerate up to one drink a month, 9% tolerate up to one drink a week and one woman thinks having one drink a day is safe. Women who actually drink during pregnancy are more likely to think that alcohol consumption to a certain level is safe. Women (31%) think that beer and/or wine are safe alcohols to a certain level during pregnancy. When asked about the source of this belief, 22% mention a gynecologist but the majority (61%) says it is a personal belief. Women (65%) in our sample are aware that alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to life-long disabilities in a child, such as delayed development (36%), birth defects/deformities (35%) and mental retardation (32%). However, up to 33% of the respondents report having no information about the effects of alcohol on the fetus and two women believe alcohol is not harmful at all. Women with lower levels of education are somewhat less knowledgeable about the risks of alcohol use during pregnancy than those with higher levels of education. There is no association between the drinking patterns of the women with their age, their professional habits and the alcohol consumption of their husbands. The women in our sample seem to be more aware of the necessity to stop smoking rather than stop drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Lebanese women are not fully aware of the recommendations and risks related to drinking during pregnancy. This is the reason why action must be taken to ensure better diffusion of these recommendations and better assessment of alcohol intake during prenatal visits. © L'Encephale, Paris, 2010.

N2  - Background: Although an extensive literature has documented a broad range of cognitive performance deficits in children with prenatal alcohol exposure, little is known about how the neurophysiological processes underlying these deficits may be affected. Event-related potentials (ERPs), which reflect task-specific changes in brain electrical activity, provide a method for examining multiple constituents of cognitive processing at the neural level.Methods: We recorded ERPs in 217 children from Inuit communities in Arctic Quebec (M age = 11.3 years) during 2 different tasks-Go/No-go response inhibition and continuous recognition memory. Children were classified as either alcohol-exposed (ALC) or controls (CON) depending on whether the mother reported binge drinking during pregnancy.Results: Both groups performed comparably in terms of accuracy and reaction time on the tasks, and both tasks elicited the expected effects on ERPs when responses were compared across conditions. However, the ALC group showed slower P2 latencies on Go/No-go, suggesting an altered neurophysiological response associated with initial visual processing of the stimuli. On the memory task, the ALC group showed reduced FN400 amplitude to New items, known as the familiarity effect, and reduced amplitude for the late positive component, possibly reflecting impairment in memory retrieval.Conclusions: These findings show that, even in tasks in which alcohol-exposed children exhibit behavioral performance that is comparable to controls, fetal alcohol exposure is associated with altered neurophysiological processing of response inhibition and recognition memory. The data suggest that fetal alcohol exposure is associated with reduced efficiency in the initial extracting of the meaning of a stimulus, reduced allocation of attention to the task, and poorer conscious, explicit recognition memory processing.

N2  - South Africa has the highest prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) in the world. The purpose of this study was to identify high risk factors associated with drinking alcohol prior to pregnancy recognition in 24 neighborhoods in the Cape Flats outside Cape Town, South Africa. An interviewer assessed risk among 619 pregnant Black/African women between the ages of 18 and 41 years. Logistic regression analyses explored factors associated with drinking alcohol post conception but prior to pregnancy recognition. Forced multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that drinking prior to pregnancy recognition was associated with being younger, single, having better living conditions, smoking, having a longer gestation prior to pregnancy recognition, having a greater number of sexual partners, and a higher incidence of intimate partner violence. Depressive symptoms tended to be higher among alcohol users. These risk factors were consistent with other research on the characteristics of South African women having children with a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and/or of non pregnant women at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. These findings highlight the need for women of child-bearing age to be routinely screened for alcohol use and its associated risk factors. Intervention efforts could be integrated into health initiatives already present in South Africa including the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malnutrition. Preconception care is particularly important since pregnancy recognition often occurs several weeks to months following conception and could be implemented by South African community health workers. These endeavors should facilitate national goals of healthier pregnancies and the elimination of FASDs in South Africa. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Our work and others' show that the teratogenic effects of alcohol can be modified by maternal genetic factors as well as genetic differences in fetal susceptibility and resistance. These genetic factors can interact with prenatal alcohol exposure-induced epigenetic changes in the offspring to result in the kaleidoscope of phenotypes that characterize fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We study this genotype X epigenotype interactions in a rat model of FASD that emulate many symptoms observed in children of alcohol-consuming mothers by focusing on epigenetic alterations of imprinted neurodevelopmental genes. One such gene is iodothyronine deiodinase III (Dio3), an imprinted gene that encodes the thyroid hormone inactivating enzyme and is highly expressed in the placenta and fetal brain. Our previous results indicate restricted thyroid hormone levels in the developing brain as a potential cause of neurodevelopmental deficits where epigenetic alterations of Dio3 expression could be directly responsible. To follow parent of origin allelic expression of Dio3 in the fetal and adult brain of the offspring of alcohol consuming and control dams we reciprocally crossed Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Brown Norway (BN) rats. In one of the reciprocal crosses, aberrant imprinting (altered allelic expression ratio and total expression) of Dio3 was found in the ethanol-exposed fetal frontal cortex with lasting consequences on thyroid hormone levels in this region in adults. Aberrant Dio3 imprinting was also found in the fetal and adult hippocampus of alcohol-exposed males. Hippocampal Dio3 enzyme levels, thyroid hormones, and social behaviors consistent with this state followed the same pattern in males only, suggesting a direct causal relationship between aberrant allelic expression of Dio3 and behavioral consequences. Importantly, all hippocampal effects were absent from females of the affected cross and from both males and females of the reciprocal cross. Thus genetic background and sex modify alcohol-induced alterations in the brain region-specific expression of Dio3 and thereby vulnerability to long-term behavioral deficits. This novel mechanism of vulnerability to prenatal alcohol that can be extended to other imprinted neurodevelopmental genes is one of the potential causes of the wide phenotypic heterogeneity in human FASD.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) constitute a significant health burden in South Africa. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has a prevalence of 60 to 70 per 1000 children of school going age in several communities in the Western and Northern Cape Provinces. FAS is characterized by developmental deficits, including growth and neurological development affecting cognitive ability and behavior, as well as causing distinct facial dysmorphology. The features of FAS and FASD have predominantly been attributed to gestational alcohol exposure with little knowledge about the effects of alcohol on gametogenesis during the preconception stage. The luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) was used to assess global DNA methylation of sperm DNA and bisulfite modification, followed by quantitative pyrosequencing, was used to assess the levels of methylation of selected CpG sites at paternally imprinted loci in sperm DNA and genomic DNA from offspring. The paternally imprinted H19 ICR which controls the reciprocal expression of H19 and IGF2, and the IGDMR controlling expression of DLK1 and GTL2 were investigated. There is significant global DNA hypomethylation of sperm DNA related to increased alcohol consumption (nondrinkers vs heavy drinkers [p = 0.018]; light drinkers vs heavy drinkers [p = 0.016]). A modest effect was observed at the H19 ICR and the IG-DMR loci correlated with alcohol consumption in humans, but no significant effect was observed at the H19 ICR in mouse sperm DNA following alcohol exposure. Interestingly, mice sired by alcohol exposed fathers had significantly reduced H19 ICR CpG methylation at the CTCF1 (p = 0.0017) and CTCF2 (p = 0.0007) binding sites. These studies confirm that paternal preconception alcohol exposure does affect global and locus specific CpG methylation and support an epigenetic mechanism for paternal alcohol related effects in their offspring.

N2  - Children of mothers who drank alcohol during pregnancy may suffer from a range of physical, neurological, and behavioral alterations. Using a rodent model, we have found that administration of choline, an essential nutrient that affects brain development, can mitigate many of the behavioral effects of developmental alcohol exposure. When administered at the same time as prenatal alcohol, choline reduces alcohol-related birth weight deficits and mitigates a variety of ethanol's effects on motor and cognitive development. However, even when administered postnatally (up to postnatal day (PD) 30), after alcohol exposure has ceased, choline supplementation reduces the severity of alcohol-induced deficits on a variety of learning tasks that depend on the functional integrity of the hippocampus, including spatial memory, working memory and trace conditioning of the eyeblink response. Choline plays many roles in brain development and function, acting as a precursor acetylcholine, membrane phospholipids, and as a methyl donor. Ethanol exposure (5.25 g/kg/day) via intubation during the third trimester equivalent brain growth spurt in Sprague-Dawley rats led to long-lasting reductions in hippocampal M1 muscarinic receptor density and increases in M2/4 muscarinic receptor density. Choline supplementation (100 mg/kg/day) from PD 4-30 did not affect M1 densities, but did significantly attenuated ethanol's effects on M2/4 muscarinic receptor density. These data indicate that choline acts, in part, by altering cholinergic functioning. In a separate experiment, rats were exposed to alcohol during the third trimester equivalent and treated with choline (100 mg/kg/day) from PD 2-20. Global DNA methylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was measured. Ethanol exposure altered DNA methylation, an effect that was attenuated with choline supplementation suggesting that choline mitigates ethanol's teratogenic effects, in part, via epigenetic mechanisms. Consistent with this finding, administration of betaine, a choline metabolite and methyl donor, also attenuates behavioral alterations associated with developmental alcohol exposure. These data suggest that choline may attenuate ethanol-related teratogenesis via several mechanisms. Elucidation of choline's mechanisms of action has important implications for the continuing identification of treatments for individuals with FASD.

N2  - It is frequently observed that fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is more easily recognized in young children. To explore how the face changes with age in those with and without histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, we analyzed over 200 Cape Coloured individuals evaluated at 2 time points, 4 years apart using 2 camera systems. We performed 3 comparisons at each age. First, we compared those with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure to controls. Then, we divided the alcohol-exposed children into two groups: those with facial dysmorphology who were classified as either FAS or partial FAS and those without dysmorphology but with heavy alcohol exposure. These nested comparisons allowed us to explore whether a unique set of variables could accurately identify those with heavy exposure who do not have the traditional physical markers of FAS. Data were analyzed using stepwise logistic regression analyses. There were few common variables that distinguished children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from controls at the two time points. At age 5, upper and lower facial depth, palpebral fissure length, minimal frontal width and nasal bridge length distinguished the 3 alcohol-exposed groups versus controls. No measure was a significant predictor in all comparisons of 5 year olds. At ages 5 and 9, when comparing alcohol exposed vs. controls, lower facial depth was a significant predictor. As expected at both ages, in alcohol-exposed children with traditional features of FAS, palpebral fissure length was smaller in the dysmorphic group than in the controls. In the comparison between controls and alcoholexposed children without traditional physical features of FAS, longer outer canthal length was associated with alcohol exposure at ages 5 and 9. At each age and in each comparison, inclusion of additional variables in the logistic regression model improved classification accuracy. Given the different models developed to predict group membership at ages 5 and 9, these data suggest that the rates of growth in the face vary during childhood development. The patterns of growth may mask some of the most characteristic features of FAS, making it more difficult to identify those who have been exposed prenatally. Interestingly, the classification rates were not dramatically different at the two ages. These data suggest that additional facial measures may be needed when assessing older children or adolescents for prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Alcohol use during human pregnancy is linked to congenital heart defects and to intrauterine growth retardation associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Objectives of our study were to determine: (i) effects of an acute, binge-drinking, ethanol (EtOH) dose during gastrulation on cardiac and placental development; and (ii) whether folate (FA) will reverse the deleterious effects of EtOH on embryogenesis by modulating WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Both avian and mouse models were analyzed. Exposure of embryos to EtOH during gastrulation induced cardiac and valve defects and embryonic growth restriction. Severity of anomalies related to timing of exposure. To initiate cardiogenesis in the embryo, the canonical Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) acts extracellularly to suppress WNT/beta-catenin signaling. This results in an up regulation of Hex (a marker of the primary heart field) and Islet-1 (a marker of the second heart field), two inducers of cardiogenesis. Exposure of gastrulating embryos to EtOH delayed Hex and Islet-1 gene expression within the cardiogenic crescent. This indicated an inhibition of Dkk1 antagonism and prolongation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling. An acute exposure of pregnant mice during gastrulation on E6.75 (morning of vaginal plug is E0.5) to an accepted binge-drinking dose of EtOH (two i.p. injections of 2.9g/kg of body weight, administered 3 hrs apart) induced cardiac valve defects in 87% of embryos and adverse changes in myocardial and placental blood flow, determined noninvasively on E15.5 by echocardiography. We had previously shown that FA supplementation overrides WNT/beta-catenin inhibition of cardiac gene induction in the heart fields. FA was tested for protective effects against EtOH exposure during cardiac specification. In the avian model, culture medium supplemented with both FA and EtOH resulted in normal Hex and Islet-1 expression and heart development. In the mouse, FA supplementation (10.5 mg/kg) provided in the chow beginning on E0.5 followed by exposure to EtOH on E6.75 showed 100% of embryos displaying normal cardiac function, valve development, and normal placental formation on E15.5, as assessed by echocardiography and by immunohistochemistry. We conclude that FA supplementation prevents the deleterious effects of alcohol by suppressing WNT/beta-catenin signaling by augmenting Wnt antagonism possibly by DNA methylation, thus allowing normal induction of gene expression and cardiomyocyte differentiation during development.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Despite alcohol's toxicity, it is widely used across the world and its effects on the premature newborn are still being explored. While newborns are already a vulnerable and high risk population, fetal alcohol exposure is thought to predispose the newborn to infections which can significantly impact morbidity. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that fetal ethanol (ETOH) exposure causes alveolar macrophage (AM) dysfunction in the developing lung but function was modulated by availability of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), nonoxidative metabolites of alcohol, are potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure and are linked to disruption of cellular functions. However, additional studies are needed to determine if these biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure contribute to alveolar macrophage dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the oleic acid form of FAEEs on the function of AM and to determine if GSH can modulate these effects Methods Used: The NR8383 cell line of rat AM was exposed to: control conditions, + 25 muM ethyl oleate, or + 50 muM ethyl oleate (60 min). After FAEE exposure, some cells were treated with GSH (500 muM) for 4 hrs. Using fluorescent microscopy, phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) was determined using MitoTracker Red CM-H2X Ros. mROS and phagocytosis was quantified as relative fluorescent units (RFU)/cell. Summary of Results: In these studies, FAEE exposure impaired the phagocytic function of AM and these affects were attenuated by the presence of GSH. There was a 10% decrease of mROS and 40% increase in phagocytosis in the cells treated with glutathione after exposure to oleic acid in comparison to cells exposed only to oleic acid. Conclusions: Acute exposure to FAEE (specifically ethyl oleate), increased AM mROS and impaired phagocytosis. Treatment with GSH attenuated these effects suggesting that FAEE exposure alone promoted oxidative stress. We hypothesize that FAEE due to prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to the dysfunction of developing AM and that these effects may be modulated by GSH.

N2  - We have observed that moderate drinking during pregnancy alters placental gene expression (Rosenberg et al., Alcohol. 44:673-90, 2010), suggesting that ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene expression might serve as a biomarker of fetal alcohol exposure. The present study addressed the question whether maternal drinking during pregnancy alters fetal cortical gene expression in a manner similar to the changes we have observed in placenta. Harlan Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed a mean of 2.72 g ethanol/kg during a fourhour period each day throughout pregnancy, a level that produces a mean peak serum ethanol level of 84 mg/dL. On gestational day 20, rat placental:fetal units were removed by Csection and whole placental and fetal cortical tissues rapidly dissected and frozen. RNA was extracted from both tissue types and processed for gene microarray analysis. Moderate drinking during pregnancy significantly altered the expression of 1041 genes in placenta and 1426 genes in cortex. Ethanol exposure repressed expression of the large majority of genes altered in both tissue types. However, only about 7% of the differentially expressed genes in placenta were also altered in cortex. In contrast to individual gene analyses, gene ontology analyses in both tissue types indicated that ethanol exposure significantly altered genes associated with the development and morphology in several tissue systems as well as immunologic responses. The top three categories that emerged from gene ontology analysis were cardiovascular as well as neural systems development and cell death. These results suggest that the analyses of placental gene ontology categories for specific organ systems may be informative of ethanol-induced alterations in fetal tissues. Given increasing evidence that cerebral microvascular development plays a critical role in neural development, our data suggest that investigating ethanol-induced perturbations in the placental vascular network may be a particularly fruitful target system for examining the utility of placenta as a biomarker tissue for fetal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol effects.

N2  - Introduction: An ongoing challenge for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is to expand recognizable facial features so that individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure who lack the classic facial phenotype can be identified, allowing for early interventions. This study aims to localize morphological changes related to prenatal alcohol exposure and determine if these can help predict exposure status. Methods: The sample included 68 healthy controls (HC), 68 heavy alcohol exposed (HE), and 23 children with partial FAS (PFAS), and 21 with FAS from the Cape Town Colored community (M age = 10.2; 89 males). 3D facial images were registered using landmarks defined by the anthropologists. The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on surface deformations and curvatures were examined using general linear models with age and gender as covariates. Group comparisons included HC vs. FAS (most extreme comparison), FAS+PFAS (expanding the FAS group to include PFAS), FAS+PFAS+HE (broadest comparison including children with a range of alcohol exposure), PFAS+HE (removing FAS, this comparison removes those with the most extreme facial dysmorphology), and HE (least extreme comparison). Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to predict alcohol exposure status. Results: The surface deformation from posterior to anterior in the HC group were detected significantly (corrected p < 0.05) larger than that in the FAS and FAS+PFAS groups in nasal bridge, nose, midface and jaw, and significantly taller than FAS+PFAS+HE in nose. The HC group also showed significantly longer and wider face than FAS, FAS+PFAS, and FAS+PFAS+HE. Although no significant curvature patterns were identified with corrected p < 0.05, maps of t statistics showed that the philtrum and mid-face regions in the HC group were more curved than those in the FAS and FAS+PFAS groups. The SVM prediction rates consistently dropped from the most extreme comparison to the least extreme one: 92.14% for HC vs FAS, 77.68% for HC vs FAS+PFAS, 61.67% for HC vs FAS+PFAS+HE, 57.23% for HC vs PFAS+HE, and 55.15% for HC vs HE. Conclusion: These results validate our hypothesis that fetal alcohol exposure had significant impact on facial dysmorphology, detected in the areas of nose, nasal bridge, mid-face, philtrum, and jaw, and facial width and length. Further studies will help find the relations between the facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and classic FAS facial phenotypes.

N2  - Facial anthropometry coupled with logistical regression has been shown to provide a sensitive complement for identifying FASD (fetal alcohol spectrum disorder). Facial anthropometry is inherently affected by the amount of facial adipose tissue that would limit its robustness. This study was designed to investigate the underlying craniofacial bone in a C57BL/6J mouse model. The objective is to identify specific craniofacial bone dysmorphology as a function of age and exposure and to establish their correlation to human anthropometry analogues. Three treated groups, ALC-ALC (pre- and pregnancy alcohol with 4.8 % (v/v) alcohol liquid), ALC-PF (pre alcohol and a calorically matched liquid pregnancy diet), and CHOW (ad lib chow/water), were examined. The pregnancy exposure lasted from embryonic day (E) 7- E16. All delivered pups were culled to 6/litter and surrogate fostered. On postnatal days (P)7 and 21, craniofacial bones were imaged using 3D microCT, and 12 craniofacial bone measurements were defined as mouse equivalents of a subset used in human studies. Data was examined by ANOVA and Logistic Regression to discern features that predict alcohol exposure with high accuracy. Longitudinal changes were tracked within each group. At P7, seven differences were observed for ALC-ALC and five for ALC-PF compared to Chow pups. Two widths (minimal frontal and inner canthal) together with one depth (middle facial) resulted in 83% (sensitivity) classification of ALC-ALC mice vs. 86% (specificity) of the PF. At P21, the differences between ALC-PF and CHOW groups diminished and lead to very low classification sensitivity (48%). ALC-ALC group maintained seven measurement differences from both CHOW and ALC-PF controls. But a lower sensitivity (75%) was observed among ALC-ALC and Chow with measures including inner canthal, inner orbital width and nasal length. The longitudinal comparison showed less growth of CHOW (minimal frontal and inner canthal width). These results suggest that dietary and alcohol effects contribute to craniofacial dysmorphology, where smaller measurements for both ALC-ALC and ALC-PF pups are seen at P7 and excellerated growth of ALC-PF at P21. There is evidence that alcohol induced dysmorphology changes with age in part due to increased relative growth of exposed individuals. This information could be important to assist in clinical variants of human FASD patients.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol abuse causes important structural and functional brain defects and is estimated to negatively impact up to 1% of pregnancies in the United States. Unfortunately, extensive efforts to promote alcohol abstinence during pregnancy have failed to reduce the incidence. A number of promising interventional strategies have been devised; however, successful implementation likely will require early identification of affected individuals. Currently, there is no effective means of identifying affected children during the perinatal period. We hypothesize that fetal ultrasonographic measurements, individually or collectively, can predict prenatal alcohol exposure. A human clinical pilot study (PMID:19444822) has established the potential for fetal ultrasonography to provide a method for prenatal identification of affected children. However, that study depended upon self-reporting of alcohol ingestion to establish exposure and is preliminary. Ultrasonography, unlike other imaging technologies like MRI, is already routinely employed during pregnancy. Additional ultrasound advantages over MRI are that examinations are less expensive, faster and not subject to motion artifact. A collection of 12 measurements of the skull, eyes, brain and legs were obtained from 76-day gestation sheep utilizing transabdominal ultrasonography. Subjects received either saline, 1.75 or 2.5 g/kg alcohol IV on three consecutive days per week from gestation day 4-41. Intraorbital and frontothalamic distances were significantly greater in the high alcohol group compared to the low alcohol and saline groups (n = 10, 13 and 14 respectively. We conclude that further efforts to develop a set of prenatal ultrasonographic measurements for FASD screening are warranted. Supported by NIAAA Grant AA0171290 (TAC).

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is diagnosed by the presence of growth retardation, central nervous system damage, and a distinct pattern of facial dysmorphology. FAS reflects the severe end of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), but the prevalence of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in FASD cases without facial dysmorphology may be 10 fold higher than FAS. Diagnosis of nondysmorphic FASD cases is very difficult, limiting opportunities for treatment and intervention. The current study used a mouse model to test whether variations in development of facial features induced by prenatal alcohol exposure are detectable using quantitative morphometric methods, and whether the duration of alcohol exposure is a contributing factor to variable dysmorphology. Female C56BL/6J mice were divided into four groups. Chow group was given ad libitum chow and water throughout the experimental period. The alcohol groups and the pair-fed (PF) group were given a liquid diet with 4.8% alcohol for 2 weeks prior to mating. During pregnancy, the ALC groups were given the alcohol diet either on embryonic days 7 (E7)-E11 or E7-E16. The PF dams were given equal volumes of an isocaloric diet on E7-E16. All embryos were analyzed at E17. Analyses included 15 facial measurements (derived as analogues of human anthropometry measures from a previous FAS study), along with measures of crown-rump lengths, weights, ocular abnormalities, head circumference, and limb development. The 4.8% alcohol liquid diet from E7-E16 caused distinct facial dysmorphology including altered whisker pad, upper facial depth, midfacial depth, and lower facial height (all p < 0.002). Two measures, upper facial depth and midfacial depth, were identified as predictors for alcohol treatments that could classify the E7-E16 alcohol group from nonexposed PF and Chow controls in a discriminant analysis, with overall correct classification 79%. However, in E7-E11 group, only upper facial depth, and minimal frontal height (both p < 0.01) were different between ALC and Controls. Alcohol significantly reduced crown-rump length, head circumference, and embryo weight in E7-E16 group, but only crown-rump length in E7-E11 group. The duration of alcohol exposure is an important factor contributing to severity of facial dysmophology and growth retardation. The E7-E11 alcohol exposure showed considerably reduced dysmorphology compared to E7-E16 alcohol exposure.

N2  - Prenatal choline supplementation has been shown to mitigate neurodevelopmental damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in rats suggesting its potential as an intervention for FASD. The recommended human choline intake during pregnancy is 450 mg/day and 3500 mg/day is the tolerable upper limit or roughly a dose of 60 mg in a 60 kg woman. Studies in rodents have exceeded this range, with no apparent side effects at 200 mg/kg in mice and 250 mg/kg in pregnant rats. However, in baboons, choline supplementation at a dose roughly equivalent to 20 mg/kg together with alcohol resulted in hepatotoxicity likely due to lower choline oxidase activity in this species. Sheep, like primates, also have lower choline oxidase activity compared to rodents, and therefore likely have a lower tolerable upper intake level of choline than rats. Therefore, we believe the ovine model is appropriate for investigating the safety and efficacy of choline supplementation. Three groups, normal control, low choline (10 mg/kg), high choline (3500 mg/kg) received vehicle or microencapsulated choline (Reashure, Balchem) once daily for 30 days at which time animals were sacrificed and the livers were perfused with formalin. Tissues were paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Three veterinary pathologists blinded to treatment group independently scored the sections for presence, severity and distribution of the following parameters: hydropic degeneration, necrosis, megalocytosis, vacuolar degeneration, regeneration, hepatic and capsular fibrosis, inflammation and cell type. No pathological changes were identified that could be attributed to choline toxicity. Though these findings support the safety of choline supplementation in sheep at doses like those recommended in humans, subjects were not pregnant, did not receive choline for a duration as long as a whole pregnancy and did not receive concurrent alcohol. Studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of choline supplementation in sheep during pregnancy and with concurrent alcohol exposure are now underway. Supported by NIAAA Grant AA0171290 (TAC).

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), but wide phenotypic variations in facial, brain, and neurobehavioral abnormalities are evident. Factors contributing to this phenotypic variation have been identified suing rodent models of alcohol exposure using various delivery methods including oral gavage, liquid diets, injections, vapor inhalation, and free choice drinking. Comparisons between inbred strains of mice have implicated genetic differences as an important risk factor, but strain differences in pharmacokinetics, alcohol preference, stress responses, nutritional status, and difficulties in matching blood alcohol levels, have made it difficult to determine genetic contributions to FASD. This study examined alcohol delivery to pregnant mouse dams of two different inbred strains, one known to be vulnerable to prenatal alcohol-induced teratogenesis (C57BL/6J; [B6]) and the other known to be resistant (129S6/SvEv/Tec; [S129]), using an ethanol vapor chamber inhalation system. Careful regulation of this system provides a means to control alcohol exposure and match the blood alcohol levels produced in the two strains, regardless of any strain differences in pharmacokinetics. Exposure of pregnant dams of each strain to alcohol vapor was limited to 4 or 6 hrs, beginning on embryonic day 8.25, followed by air alone for 44 or 42 hr additional growth. Control groups were exposed to air alone. Embryos were then collected on E10 and assessed for teratogenesis and growth retardation using van Maele-Fabry scoring. By fine tuning vapor concentration settings, the settings were able to consistently target blood alcohol profiles with peak levels of 200, 300, or 400 mg/dl over the testing period established for both strains. The B6 embryos showed alcohol-induced growth retardation for somite number, caudal neural tube, branchial processes, and optic system at 300 mg/dl. At 400 mg/dl additional heart, maxillary process, and fore-, mid- and hindbrain developmental delays were evident. A concentration-dependent decreased in embryo survival and litter size was also found for B6 dams. The 129S strain showed limited delay forelimb formation at 300 mg/dl. Further study in higher dose is in progress. These findings using in vivo exposure at comparable blood alcohol levels are consistent with our previous studies embryo culture methods.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can have detrimental effects on the developing fetus, resulting in a constellation of developmental, behavioral and CNS deficits known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Many variables play a role in susceptibility to FASD, including genetics. Work from our lab and others has shown that C57BL/6J (B6) mice are susceptible to ethanolinduced teratogenesis, while DBA/2J (D2) mice are relatively resistant. We have demonstrated that maternal genotype also plays an important role in susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of ethanol. In this study, we further elucidate the genetic pathways mediating susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis by examining global changes in gene expression in embryonic and placental-decidual tissue derived from B6 and D2 mice. Methods: We generated both homozygous (B6B6 and D2D2) and reciprocal heterozygous (B6D2 and D2B6) offspring genotypes. On gestational day 9, females were given 5.8 g/kg ethanol (20% w:v) or maltose-dextrin by oral gavage; a nonintubated control group was also included. 4 hrs later, tissue was harvested and subsequently processed for microarray analysis. Five litters were used for each combination of treatment, tissue type and strain, for a total of 120 arrays. For the analysis, we removed probe sets that contained SNPs that differed across strains. Data were then normalized, log transformed and filtered by 'absent' and 'present' status for a final set of 13,558 probe sets that were used for ANOVA and Gene Ontology analysis. Results: We report on genes with significant main effects of strain, ethanol, tissue and/or strain by ethanol interactions. In general, we found that strain type explained the most variability in expression. For the probe sets significantly different in the homozygous strains, we found enrichment in metabolic and development related genes. Ethanol treatment affected the expression of mRNA processing and metabolism genes. Expression of development related genes significantly differed among tissues. Most surprisingly, for the ethanol by strain interaction, we found that the majority of differentially regulated genes were specifically affected in the B6B6, followed by the B6D2 strains. Conclusion: We have discovered gene expression differences mediated by both genetic and maternal effects that potentially modulate susceptibility to ethanol-induced teratogenesis.

N2  - The hippocampus is a site of adult neurogenesis believed to contribute to learning and memory. Previous work in our lab has shown that exposure to moderate levels of alcohol throughout gestation results in a diminished neurogenic response to environmental enrichment within the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (Choi et al., 2005). The goal of the current research is to determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure impairs the ability of newlygenerated adult dentate granule cells (DGCs) to incorporate into spatial memory networks. For these studies, we utilized Nestin-CreERT2:YFP bitransgenic mice in which tamoxifen exposure induces YFP reporter gene expression in nestin+ neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and all subsequent progeny. Mice received tamoxifen injections at a dose of 180 mg/kg/day, i.p., for five consecutive days, and were subsequently trained on hippocampaldependent tasks 6 to 8 weeks following the final injection. Mice were either trained on the 2- way separation radial arm maze using 2 training sessions per day for 2 days, followed by 3 days of memory recall testing; or the mice were exposed to a 7 trial trace fear conditioning paradigm and tested for memory recall 24 hours later to context and tone. Ninety minutes following the recall tests, mice were sacrificed and evaluated for the expression of c-Fos and YFP reporter colocalization. Preliminary data indicate that approximately 3% of YFP labeled adult-born DGCs express c-Fos during recall in the radial arm maze paradigm, as compared to 0% in behavioral test control mice. Quantification of c-Fos/YFP colocalization following trace conditioning is currently underway. Once optimized, these paradigms will be used to determine the impact of prenatal alcohol on functional incorporation of YFP+ DGCs.

N2  - We hypothesized that some of the deleterious effects of ethanol on the developing brain may be due to the disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in brain cells as cholesterol deficiencies cause brain anomalies associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities similar to the ones reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. We have previously shown that ethanol induces cholesterol efflux in astrocytes, but not in neurons, through the upregulation of the cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Astrocytes also secrete lipoproteins; as ABCA1 and ABCG1 are involved in the biogenesis and maturation of lipoproteins, which are cholesterol acceptors and extract cholesterol from both neurons and astrocytes, we hypothesized that ethanol may upregulate lipoprotein production in astrocytes and, through this mechanism, increase cholesterol efflux from astrocytes and neurons. Using fast liquid lipoprotein chromatography (FPLC) with a size exclusion column, we separated astrocytegenerated lipoproteins (A-Lps) from astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM). The levels of phospholipids, cholesterol and apolipoprotein E (Apo E), the three main components of A-Lps, were quantified in 71 fractions eluted from FPLC by ELISA (ApoE) and enzymatic assays (phospholipids and cholesterol). We found that after 48 h ethanol treatments, the levels of phospholipids, cholesterol and ApoE were significantly increased in elution fractions 16-36, suggesting a significant increase in the production and release of A-Lps. In addition, we found that while the ACM containing normal A-Lps were able to induce cholesterol efflux from naive neurons and astrocytes, the ACM from ethanol treated astrocytes, containing more A-Lps, further increased cholesterol efflux from both cell types. To explore the consequences of the exposure of neurons to cholesterol acceptors we incubated neurons with High Density Lipoproteins (HDL) for different lengths of time; 3- and 5-day incubations with HDL resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular cholesterol and neuronal survival in cortical primary neurons. Based on these results, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure may cause neuronal cell death by increasing the release of lipoproteins from astrocytes leading to increased cholesterol efflux and reduced cholesterol content in neurons.

N2  - Evidence converging from clinical and preclinical studies of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) shows that motor deficits are associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Children exposed to alcohol in utero display impairments of manual dexterity, strength of grip, and postural balance. However, little is known about motor sequencing in this population. Given that motor sequencing is critically important for performance of skilled tasks such as typing and writing, the present study investigated the neural aspects of this function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve right-handed children with FASD, ages 12 to 18, and 11 age- and gender matched controls participated. The participants completed a test battery including a motor sequencing task, in which they performed simple and complex finger sequences using the dominant or the nondominant hand. The motor sequences were administered using a procedure described by Haaland et al. (2004). In this procedure, a simple sequence involved making key presses 5 times with the index (1), middle (2), or ring (3) finger (e.g. 1,1,1,1,1; 2,2,2,2,2). A complex sequence involved performance of 5 key presses with the 3 fingers in a mixed order (1,3,2,1,2; 3,1,2,3,1 etc.). Whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to record BOLD signals during performance of the motor sequencing task. Analyses of the behavioral data showed that the two groups differed in performances of complex, but not simple, sequences. The FASD group took longer and made more errors than the control group on the complex sequences. The fMRI data revealed that the FASD group showed greater BOLD signal changes than the control group during performance of the simple sequences, despite the lack of group differences on behavioral measures. For example, when performing the simple sequences with the right hand, the FASD group showed greater task-related BOLD signal changes in the left inferiortemporal, right orbitofrontal, and left occipital cortices, as well as in a region along the calcarine fissure. In contrast, the control group displayed greater bold signal changes in bilateral occipital, bilateral temporal, bilateral frontal regions as well as in the cerebellum and the basal ganglia during performance of the complex sequences. This pattern is consistent with the finding that children with FASD display difficulty with complex tasks that involve cognitive control.

N2  - The underlying physiological abnormalities associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in children are poorly understood. Identifying both basic sensory and cognitive deficits in young children with FASD is important to facilitate a broader understanding of the deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure; as is identifying potential markers for early diagnosis of FASD in young children. We recruited children aged 3 to 6 years [9 FASD and 18 age-matched healthy controls (HC)] to participate in a study to characterize auditory and somatosensory integration using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Bilateral tones and air puff tactile stimulation to bilateral index fingers were presented both individually and synchronously to the children as they viewed a silent movie while resting with their head in the MEG machine. Movement compensation software was used to account for head position movement throughout the data collection period. Trials with movements or other artifacts were rejected and the remaining trials were signal averaged. MRIs of the children were used to register the cortical sources identified with MEG to the structural anatomy. The time courses of the primary auditory sources were compared between the FASD and the HC children. In the auditory alone condition, there was a trend for a delayed response in the FASD. Preliminary results also showed a delayed auditory response in the primary auditory cortex in the FASD group during the synchronous auditory/somatosensory condition. The peak latency of the right hemisphere auditory M100 response was significantly (t = 2.0; p = 0.04) delayed in the children with FASD (150 ms) relative to the healthy control children (122 ms). These results suggest possible auditory processing deficits in children with FASD relative to healthy control children, which are amplified in the synchronous auditory/somatosensory condition. Basic sensory processing deficits and deficits in cortical integration including multisensory processing may play a role in improper development of higher cognitive functions. Further research exploring the relationship between sensory and cognitive deficits is needed to better understand the effect of auditory deficits on outcome in these young children.

N2  - Previous studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with poorer reading and phonological awareness (e.g., Streissguth et al.,1994; Adnams et al., 2007). Fetal alcohol exposure is also associated with slower processing speed (Jacobson et al., 1993, 1994; Kable & Coles., 2004; Burden et al., 2005). The aim of the study was to examine the degree to which effects of alcohol on reading rate and phonological awareness mediate reading comprehension deficits in a heavy alcohol exposed cohort in Cape Town, South Africa. 47 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) children (M age = 11.3, SD = 1.2) were administered the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability and the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhaB). The 31 mothers of the heavy alcohol exposed children reported drinking an average of 5.1 drinks/day, which were concentrated on 2.8 days/week. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with slower reading rate (beta = -0.30, p < 0.05) and poorer reading comprehension (beta = -0.31, p < 0.05), after control for potential confounders including maternal smoking during pregnancy and child age. No differences were seen in relation to child gender. The effect on reading comprehension remained significant after controlling for IQ, suggesting that reading comprehension may be a specific target of alcohol exposure. On the PhaB, prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with slower naming speed for digits and pictures (beta = -0.33 and )0.35, respectively, both ps < 0.05). Prenatal exposure was not related to alliteration or rhyme but was related to poorer performance on spoonerisms, a more challenging form of phonological processing (beta = -0.31, p < 0.05). The effect of alcohol on reading comprehension was mediated by the effect of alcohol on reading rate (z = -2.04, p < 0.05). The effect on reading comprehension was also mediated by spoonerisms (z = -2.09, p < 0.05). These findings indicate deficits in both reading rate, a measure of automaticity, and phonological awareness, two important aspects of reading, mediate the alcohol-related deficits in reading comprehension. The mediating role of reading rate is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating alcohol-related processing speed deficits, which are already evident during infancy, and with recent findings suggesting that white matter integrity may be a specific target of fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure has been associated with impaired verbal learning and memory (Mattson & Roebuck, 2002). The aim of our study was to replicate previous findings on effects of heavy exposure on the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version and to extend these to children with moderate exposure. Data from two prospective longitudinal cohorts were analysed. The Cape Town (CT) Cohort (mean age = 9.2 yr, SD = 0.41) included 6 children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 14 with partial FAS (PFAS), 9 nonsyndromal with heavy exposure (HE), and 18 controls born to abstainers or light drinkers from the same community. The Detroit Cohort (mean age = 14.4 yr; SD = 0.62) included 19 children with heavy exposure (AA/day > 1.0 oz), 21 with moderate exposure (AA/day 0.5- 0.99), and 251 light- to nonexposed (AA/day < 0.5) controls. The primary impairment in the CT heavily-exposed children occurred at the level of encoding new information. There were significant between-group differences in total number of words learned after five learning trials; post hoc analysis indicated that FAS and PFAS groups performed more poorly than controls, ps < 0.05. Consistent with previous research, the CT alcohol-exposed children learned the information at a slower rate than nonexposed controls. Significant short-delay but not longdelay recall deficits were seen in the CT children. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were found between groups for number of words learned across the five learning trials in the moderate-heavy exposed Detroit Cohort. Significant between-groups differences on short- and long-delay recall indicate that the primary impairment for the Detroit alcoholexposed children was at the level of retrieving information. These effects were dosedependent; recall by the moderately-exposed children was intermediate between the light- to nonexposed and heavy-exposed participants, ps < 0.05. Furthermore, alcohol-exposed children in both CT and Detroit showed poorer recognition memory. Thus, only the heavilyexposed children in CT showed learning (encoding) deficits in this relatively simple list learning task, but both moderate and heavy exposure were associated with poorer recognition and recall, suggesting that memory retrieval is particularly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Purpose of the Study. Prenatal alcohol exposure affects neural development and is associated with white matter deficits. The corpus callosum (CC) which joins the left and right hemispheres is frequently affected; neuroimaging studies have identified alterations in white matter integrity in CC. This study examines the extent to which prenatal exposure is associated with inefficiencies in cognitive tasks that require cross callosal transfer of information in order to support the argument that deficits in cognition and behavior observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from effects on brain connectivity in this region. Methods. 234 young adults (M age: 22.78, SD: 1.79) were evaluated as part of a longitudinal study of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four groups of participants included: Unexposed Controls (CON: n = 58), Alcohol Exposed and Dysmorphic (DYSM: n = 47), Alcohol exposed with no physical effects (ETOH: n = 75), and Unexposed volunteers who qualified for Special Education Services as children (SpecED = 54). Neuropsychological assessment included the following measures that require cross-callosal transfer of information for efficient performance: Sensory: Finger Localization (Benedetti, 1988); Auditory: Dichotic listening measured using the Scan-A (Keith, 1995), Visual: Visual Alexia (Leff, et al. 2001). Subtests of these measures, which required integration of information across hemisphere, were selected. These included the Bilateral Condition on finger localization, Competing Reversal on the Scan-A and identification of words in the left visual field on Visual Alexia. Results. For each assessment measure, multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures compared performance among the four experimental groups. Deficits in performance by the DYSM Group were noted on all measures of interest. However, measures sensitive to cross callosal interference were not more affected than other outcomes and interactions between group status and laterality measures were not found. Conclusion. Alcohol-affected young adults demonstrated a generalized deficit in cognitive performance across a number of measures. However, these deficits are not confined to those measures associated with cross modal transmission of information suggesting that deficits cannot be attributed to effects of their prenatal exposure on callosal functioning. It is more likely that there is a general loss of processing efficiency.

N2  - A pilot study examining the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of choline supplementation in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is underway. Preclinical data (J. Thomas et al.) suggest that post-natal choline supplementation in rats may attenuate some of the cognitive and behavioral abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. The literature shows that peri-natal choline supplementation has direct positive effects on hippocampal growth and function in normal development and in pre-natal alcohol exposure. No human choline trials have yet been completed in FASD. Twenty children between the ages of 2.5 and 5.0 years have been enrolled in a nine-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of choline supplementation. The dose, 500 mg per day, is double the recommended daily intake level but below the upper tolerable limit for this age (100 mg). Outcome data currently being collected include measures of global cognitive development (Mullen Scales), memory (elicited imitation paradigm, P. Bauer), executive functioning (conflict / delay, S. Carlson), behavior ratings (Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist), and evoked response potential (ERP) / visually evoked potential (VEP) measures. Thus far, only one child has dropped out (because of refusal to take the study agent). There have been no adverse events. Compliance has been very good as evidenced by packet counts, logsheets, and serum choline levels collected at baseline and 1 month (presented here). Administration of the study agent has been modified slightly in 9 cases (dose splitting, adulterating, etc.) in order to improve child compliance. Reports of potential side effects have been low. Most commonly seen have been fishy body odor and increased urination. Because the blind is still in place, it is not yet known if there are group differences in these or other potential side effects. Thus far, choline supplementation at 500 mg. per day appears to be associated with minimal side effects and is reasonably well-tolerated by 2-4 year old children with FASD. Parental interest and compliance have been strong over the course of the study.

N2  - Background. Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) depends on health care providers detecting maternal risk drinking in pregnancy. NIAAA and ACOG recommend using the T-ACE, an economical/sensitive screen. We reported that a more stringent T-ACE total score cut-point (3 vs. 2) increased specificity in identifying maternal risk drinking and alcoholrelated neurobehavioral dysfunction in children (Chiodo et al, 2010). If validated, the TACER3 could increase efficient clinical practice. Objective. Assess how changing the T-ACE cut-point affects detection of risk drinking. Methods. Self-reported peri-conceptional and in-pregnancy drinking was assessed with semistructured interviews and alcohol screens in a prospective subsample of 239 African-American mothers given an in-pregnancy T-ACE. Both the original T-ACE risk criterion (total score of 2 - T-ACE) and the revised T-ACE definition criterion (total score of 3 - TACER3) were analyzed. ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons compared prepregnancy and pregnancy alcohol consumption quantity and frequency measures by risk category. Categories include: 1) No Risk Group (NRG) = no risk for pregnancy alcohol use based on both T-ACE and TACER3 criteria (n = 140); 2) At Risk Group (ARG) based on both T-ACE and TACER3 criteria (n = 28); and 3) Change Risk Group (CRG) identified as at-risk with the original T-ACE criterion but not at-risk using the revised TACER3 criterion (n = 71). Results. The 71 women (30%) in the Change Risk Group (CRG) had patterns of alcohol use similar to the no risk group (NRG). As predicted, post hoc analysis revealed that the at-risk group (ARG) had significantly more alcohol use both prior to and during pregnancy than either the NRG or CRG groups. Conclusion. The data presented provides further evidence that adjusting the T-ACE total score cut point to 3 in the TACER3 is clinically appropriate, removes nonrisk drinking women from potential intervention without missing women who are drinking at risk levels during pregnancy. Using the TACER3 criteria, only 12% of women would require intervention, while using the TACE criteria, 41% of women would score as at-risk and would require physician intervention. Increasing the total T-ACE score criterion from 2 to 3 results in fewer "false positives," reducing physician time with these patients and allowing a more intensive targeted clinical response for pregnant women correctly identified as drinking at fetal risk levels.

N2  - Ethanol exposure during pregnancy is known to alter fetal brain development through cellular apoptosis. Although there is no method of prevention, studies from us and others showed that derived peptide from activity dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) can be used as a trophic peptide for neuroprotection. In this study, we further characterize the proteomic architecture underlying the role of ADNF-9 against ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E13 with either a 25% ethanol derived calorie (25% EDC, ALC), 25% EDC simultaneously administered ADNF-9 (ALC-ADNF-9), or pair-fed (PF) liquid diets. At E13, fetal brains were collected from 5 dams for each group. Individual brains were homogenized and the extracted proteins were then tryptically digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Label-free quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on proteomes extracted from fetal brains of all three ALC, ALCADNF- 9, and PF groups. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) score plots of the abundances of all proteins identified in the three groups were analyzed. Statistical differences in the areas and number of proteins between PF and ALC groups (137 proteins), PF and ALC-ADNF-9 groups (228 proteins), and ALC and ALC-ADNF-9 groups (23 proteins) resulted in a distinct data-clustering thus yielding obvious separation of the sample groups in the PCA score plot. The statistical analyses demonstrated significant upregulation of several proteins including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p = 0.009023), dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 1 (p = 0.009023), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (p = 0.02828), microtubule-associated protein 1B (p = 0.02828), eukaryotic translation initiation factor (p = 0.02828), histone-binding protein RBBP4 (p = 0.02828), and nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1 (p = 0.016294) in ALC-ADNF-9 group as compared to ALC group. These findings provide information about possible mechanisms underlying the effects of ADNF-9 in neuroprotection against the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure during early embryonic stage.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) exhibit long lasting behavioral impairments, such as learning disabilities, problems in executive functioning and memory deficits. Using a rat model of voluntary drinking during pregnancy, we have shown that the antagonism of histamine H3 receptors reverses fetal ethanol-induced deficits learning and dentate granule cell long-term potentiation. Given that H3 receptors inhibit neurotransmitter release, we hypothesized that fetal alcohol exposure elevates H3 receptor-mediated depression of glutamate release from perforant path nerve terminals in the dentate gyrus. In the present study, this hypothesis was examined using two different approaches. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed an average of 2.72 g/kg/ day of 5% sweetened ethanol solution throughout gestation. This level of consumption produces a mean peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. No differences in offspring birthweight or litter size were observed. In the first experiment, we examined the effects of moderate prenatal ethanol exposure on methimepip-stimulated [35S]-GTPcS binding. H3 receptor agonist-stimulated GTP binding in the dorsal dentate gyrus was significantly increased in fetal ethanol-exposed offspring. Second, we examined H3 modulation of paired-pulse plasticity, an indirect measure of neurotransmitter release, in dentate gyrus slices of prenatally exposed offspring and controls. Evoked perforant path to dentate field potentials were not affected by prenatal exposure to ethanol. Bath application of methimepip, another H3 agonist, did not affect paired pulse ratio (PPR) in control offspring, but significantly increased PPR in ethanol exposed offspring, indicating a net decrease in evoked glutamate release. Methimepip effects in the ethanol exposed group were partially reversed by concomitant application of ABT-239, a histamine H3 antagonist. Taken together, these results suggest a heightened H3 receptor-mediated modulation of glutamate release in the dentate gyrus of fetal-ethanol exposed rats. We expect that these experiments will provide insights into the mechanisms by which prenatal ethanol exposure affects synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-sensitive learning. A better understanding of this phenomenon may provide targets for therapeutic intervention in children with FASD.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and autopsy studies reveal abnormal cerebellar development in children who had been exposed to alcohol prenatally, independent of the exposure period. We previously reported that prenatal alcohol exposure during the first, third or all three trimester equivalent of human brain development reduces cerebellar Purkinje cell number in prenatal lambs. In the present study, ewes received binge paradigm alcohol exposure (3 days on, 4 days off, 1.75 g/kg administered IV as a 40% solution) during the first (E1, gestational days 4-41) or all three (E3, gestation days 4 to 132) trimester equivalent. Lambs were born, the faces were evaluated for facial dysmorphology (reported elsewhere) and they were subjected to spatial delayed alteration and classical eyeblink conditioning learning testing (reported elsewhere). Lambs were then sacrificed and whole brains and brain components were weighed and cerebellar Purkinje cells were counted utilizing unbiased stereology procedures. Purkinje cell number in E1 and E3 exposed lamb groups were significantly reduced compared to normal and saline control groups (8.7 +/- 0.4, 9.3 +/- 0.6, 14.2 +/- 1.1, 12.6 +/- 1.3 x 107 mean +/- SEM, n = 7, 8, 5, 7 respectively) . There were no significant differences in whole brain or brain component weights. Interestingly, we did not find behavioral deficits. However, a subset of facial measures obtained at birth classified alcoholexposed and non-alcohol exposed lambs wwith 72% sensitivity and 83% specificity suggesting that alcohol-induced changes in the face can predict altered neurodevelopmental development. All or part of this work was done in conjunction with the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), which is funded by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA).

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with deficits in working memory, but it is not clear how this impairment is related to the functional organization of working memory in the brain. A standard verbal n-back task was administered to 47 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) children from a prospective longitudinal cohort in Cape Town, South Africa, where there is an exceptionally high incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and related disorders. The cohort included 17 children with FAS or partial FAS (PFAS), 13 heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE), and 17 non- or light exposed controls. All but one child with FAS were right-handed. All three groups of children (M age=9.4 yr, SD=0.4; 23 boys, 24 girls) performed well on a 1-back task administered in our neuropsychological laboratory and in a Siemens 3T Allegra scanner, but only the children in the nonexposed control group performed better than chance on a 2-back task. The n-back paradigm administered in the scanner alternated between blocks of 0-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), 1-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), and rest (20 s). Data were analyzed in SPM8, using standard methods. Intra-group one-sample t-tests were used to identify the principal regions recruited under conditions of working memory (1-back > 0-back). Analyses were conducted in 5 regions of interest (ROIs) central to verbal working memory: dorsal prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, caudate/putamen, parietal cortex, and cerebellar crus I and II. Cluster extent thresholds were determined using AlphaSim based on 104 Monte Carlo simulations across the individual ROIs. Controls recruited left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), suggesting use of a verbal rehearsal strategy to perform the task. By comparison, the HE group recruited a broad range of fronto-striatal regions, including left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left caudate. These frontostriatal regions were not recruited by the FAS/ PFAS group, who instead relied on crus I and II within the cerebellum and parietal cortex. These findings suggest differential functional organization of the brain's basic cognitive systems in children with different forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, when compared with nonexposed controls. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that children who meet diagnostic criteria for FAS and PFAS use qualitatively different compensatory strategies to perform a simple cognitive task than those used by heavily exposed nonsyndromal children.

N2  - Eyeblink conditioning (EBC), which involves temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (a tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (an air puff), has been shown to be consistently impaired in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). A growing body of evidence suggests that white matter may be a specific target of alcohol teratogenesis. This study used DTI to examine the degree to which the fetal alcohol-related deficit in EBC may be mediated by structural impairment in the cerebellar peduncles, an important white matter component of the welldocumented EBC circuit. 13 children with FAS/PFAS and 12 matched controls (9.7 to 13.7 yr) were scanned using DTI and MPRAGE MRI sequences on a 3T MAGNETOM Allegra. A voxelwise analysis was performed on fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity images. Type I error was controlled by setting a cluster volume threshold at a voxel level significance of p < 0.01. Two EBC tasks were administered: delay, in which there was a 650ms delay between the onset of a 750 ms tone and an air puff, and trace, in which a 500ms interval occurred between the offset of a 750 ms tone and the onset of the puff. Alcohol-exposed vs. control group differences in FA and perpendicular diffusivity were identified in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. These group differences, which remained significant even after controlling for brain and cerebellar volumes, were dose-dependent. Trace conditioning was related to higher FA and lower perpendicular diffusivity in that same area of the left middle peduncle. Trends for delay conditioning were similar but fell short of statistical significance in this small sample. The standardized regression coefficient relating prenatal alcohol to trace conditioning decreased from )0.61 to )0.28 when FA was entered into a regression analysis. This decrease, which was statistically significant (t = -2.38, p < 0.05), suggests that the effect of prenatal alcohol on trace conditioning is mediated, in part, by lower FA. The effect of alcohol exposure on trace conditioning was also significantly mediated by cerebellar white matter volume but not by total brain, cerebellar, or cerebellar gray matter volume. This study extends recent findings that have used DTI to reveal microstructural deficits in white matter in children with FASD. The results suggest mediation of the fetal alcohol-related effect on EBC by deficits in cerebellar white matter volume and integrity.

N2  - Exposure of the developing fetus to alcohol during pregnancy causes a myriad of abnormalities leading to phenotypes collectively known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). A leading cause of mental retardation, FASD is a major public health problem. One of the most prominent pathologic effects of alcohol in the fetal brain is neuronal death. However, there is currently no available preventive measure for protecting developing neurons against alcohol toxicity. One of the major goals of our laboratory has been to identify agents that can prevent alcohol-induced neuronal death. We have previously demonstrated that stimulation of the cAMP pathway protects immature neurons against alcohol toxicity. Because elevated intracellular cAMP concentrations activate this pathway, agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels may protect neurons against alcohol toxicity. Rolipram is a commercially available phosphodiesterase inhibitor that blocks the degradation of cAMP specifically in neurons. We hypothesized that Rolipram can protect developing neurons against alcohol toxicity by increasing intracellular cAMP levels to stimulate the cAMP-PKACREB pathway. As a first step, using an adenoviral reporter vector, we demonstrated that rolipram stimulates the cAMP pathway in cerebellar granule neurons. We further showed that Rolipram induces phosphorylation of the CREB transcription factor, which is the downstream effector molecule of the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway. In addition, we demonstrated that cerebellar granule neurons exposed to alcohol (0 or 400 mg/dl) in vitro were protected against alcohol toxicity by rolipram (5 to 20 uM) in a dose dependent manner. Whereas alcohol killed nearly 25% of neurons, Rolipram reduced the cell death to less then 5%. These results suggest that Rolipram may ameliorate alcohol-induced neurotoxicity in the developing brain by stimulating the neuroprotective cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during gestation is responsible for a wide spectrum of symptoms in the developing fetus under the umbrella of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Defects affect the central nervous system, craniofacial structures, mental ability, and growth. However, the underlying mechanism by which ethanol (EtOH) acts during embryonic development is still poorly understood at the molecular level. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) as a model for FASD, we have previously reported (Arzumanyan et al., 2009, Ogony et al., 2010; Vadigepalli et al., 2010) that EtOH modulates the protein level of several transcription factors (TFs) during cell differentiation towards neuronal fate. Here we study the EtOH effects on the steady state level of TF transcripts during ES cell differentiation. E14Tg2a.4 ES cells were differentiated for different times in an adherent culture in a medium supplemented with retinoic acid (RA, 10nM), in the presence or absence of EtOH (100mM). Cells were characterized by morphology and staining with alkaline phosphatase, and immunocytochemistry for pluripotency-associated TFs Sox2, Nanog, Pou5f1, and markers of the three lineage layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm). We have evaluated TFs of the ES cell regulatory network and their target genes, using a novel microfluidic high throughput BioMark platform and dynamic arrays of 48.48 (assays x samples = 2304) and 96.96 (9216) real time PCR measurements. Transcript levels were quantified by the comparative Ct method and normalized to the expression of housekeeping genes. We determined the expression of markers of pluripotency and self-renewal (e.g., Sox2, Nanog, Pou5f1, Klf4, Dax1, Rex1, Esrrb), and neuroectodermal lineage related genes (e.g., Cxcl12, Nestin, Neurog, Notch, Pax6, Sox3, Sox4, Ascl1, Meis1, Zic1). Data show that during ES cell differentiation EtOH delays the downregulation of pluripotency markers like Sox2, Nanog and Pou5f1 (Oct4) and consequently perturbs the upregulation of target differentiation genes, interfering with the commitment of ES cells to neuroectodermal lineage. Our findings provide insights into the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of ES cell differentiation and may lead to a better understanding of developmental defects observed in FASD.

N2  - Increasing evidence indicates that the majority of children adversely affected by fetal alcohol exposure do not present with birth defects. Without physical signs suggestive of prenatal alcohol exposure, accurate information about maternal drinking is required for a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and to consider early interventions. This study assesses a combination of biomarkers capable of capturing different patterns of alcohol use because no single ethanol biomarker is sensitive or specific enough to reliably assess alcohol consumption. In 2009, the University of New Mexico (UNM) established a cohort study of pregnant women attending the UNM-affiliated substance abuse treatment program to evaluate validity of a broad array of maternal and fetal/newborn biomarkers. Eligible patients are screened and enrolled during one of the first prenatal care visits and are followed-up throughout pregnancy to early postpartum period. In addition to structured maternal interviews to assess quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, a broad array of biomarkers of alcohol exposure is evaluated. Biomarkers that capture recent exposure (several days to 3 weeks) include ethyl glucuronide (EtG), phosphatidylethanol (PEth), and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (%CDT). Gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) can identify more chronic exposure. In addition, some biomarkers might be useful for identifying cumulative exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, i.e., meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). Lastly, we are investigating biomarker's validity in novel media, e.g., hair analysis of EtG and FAEE, PEth in dried blood spots on a filter paper collected during the routine newborn screen. Some of the unique challenges for this prospective study include identification of subjects at the admission to the UNM hospital for labor and delivery and collection of biological samples according to the study protocol within the first 24 hours since admission. The following activities have been implemented at UNM hospital to facilitate timely collection and processing of maternal and newborn specimens: 1) intensive in-service training of the nursing personnel in research-related activities; 2) installation of an ultra-low temperature freezer at the Mother-Baby Unit to facilitate processing of meconium samples; 3) development of research orders in electronic medical records of study participants to be initiated by the nursing staff in the Labor and Delivery and Newborn Nursery units; 4) collaboration with the UNM Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) pediatric research nurses While meconium collection presents unique challenges, we were able to collect samples from n > 90% of infants born to cohort participants. Our results also indicate that 98% of the cohort participants consented to collection of scalp hair. Given the difficulties of confirming maternal drinking during pregnancy, as well as diagnosing less severe cases of FASD during the neonatal period, the development of better biomarkers, either alone or in combination with other measures, would facilitate earlier identification of affected children and allow for earlier interventions to maximize a child's long-term prognosis.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of permanent neurodevelopmental disability and affect 2-5% of live births. A major dilemma is that FASD severity varies widely even after controlling for maternal alcohol intake. The mechanism/s underlying this variance is unknown. We examined the influence of maternal iron status because gestational iron deficiency (ID) causes neurodevelopmental impairments that parallel those of FASD. Moreover, ethanol dysregulates iron homeostasis through its effects on hepcidin expression. Here we show that maternal iron status is a selective and synergistic modifier of alcohol's neurotoxicity. We used an established rat model of third trimester-equivalent binge drinking, in which pups received 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg ethanol daily from postnatal days (P) 5-9; this targeted the ethanol-sensitive brain growth spurt period. Pups were reared using iron-sufficient (IS, 100 ppm) or ID (4 ppm) diets from GD13.5 until weaning, when all received IS diets to P35, when their neurobehavior was evaluated. Whereas ID dams had largely normal iron indicators, the ID offspring were anemic and had significantly decreased iron indicators. Iron status did not affect blood ethanol levels or clearance. We found that iron status significantly impacted key diagnostics of FASD. One of these is somatic growth, which was significantly reduced by the ID+alcohol combination (p<0.001). Neurobehavioral disabilities are the most devastating outcomes of FASD; we tested a range of behaviors at P35, when iron status had normalized. Separately, ID and alcohol had little effect on behavioral outcomes. However, ID+alcohol synergized to profoundly worsen associative learning as measured using multiple tasks including short-delay and trace eyeblink classical conditioning (p=0.022), and auditory and contextural fear conditioning (p=0.008). The ID+alcohol interaction was selective because other tasks (limb grip strength, motor coordination, open field behavior) were largely unaffected by ID or alcohol singly or in combination. We evaluated brain morphology to gain insights into mechanism. At P10 ID+alcohol did not affect neuronal proliferation (phosphohistone H3) but additively increased neuronal apoptosis (caspase-3, p=0.004) within the cerebellum. The increased cerebellar apoptosis in ID+alcohol resulted, at P35, with significantly fewer of the Purkinje and interpositus neurons that mediate ECC learning, as measured using unbiased stereology. Cerebellar secondary myelination was also significantly reduced by the ID+alcohol combination, measured using immunostain for myelin basic protein. Myelination and cell survival are separately and modestly impaired by ID and alcohol; we suggest that their synergistic disruption by ID+alcohol selectively impaired associative learning. We conclude that maternal iron status is a hitherto unappreciated and potent modifier of alcohol's neurotoxicity. The findings also offer novel insights into how ID and alcohol damage the developing brain. FASD is difficult to prevent because alcoholics do not reveal their drinking behavior. These findings have significant public health implications given the high rates of alcohol abuse and ID in childbearing-age women. We propose that aggressive screening and treatment of maternal ID is a safe and clinically achievable approach to improve FASD outcomes.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which manifests itself in the form of physiological defects, mental retardation and neurobehavioural deficits, the latter of which is rarely diagnosed. Since maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure and risk for FASD. While Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters (FAEEs) are current biomarkers of exposure, the introduction of a second biomarker that can be tested alongside FAEEs promises to greatly increase the sensitivity and specificity of analytical screens. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium, or first stool of life, of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Whether this detected EtG was formed by the maternal liver and crossed the placenta, by the fetal liver after ethanol crossed the placenta, or by the placenta itself remains unknown. Objectives: To determine if, and to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta, and to measure placental formation and degradation of EtG. Methods: Placentae from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario will be taken to the onsite perfusion laboratory. One mug/mL EtG will be added to the maternal reservoir and maternal and fetal samples will be taken over a 3 hour period to determine if and to what degree EtG is crossing the human placenta. EtG will be quantified using HS-SPME GCMS. Placental metabolism of ethanol to EtG and EtG to ethanol will be investigated using placental microsomes. Kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km) will also be determined to help elucidate the role of the placenta in formation and degradation of EtG. Results: To date the perfusions are being carried out and the level of EtG in the perfusate will be determined using HS-SPME GC-MS with a limit of sensitivity of 1 ng/vial. Conclusions: We have developed a HS-SPME method for detecting EtG in maternal and fetal perfusate samples. This will allow us to accurately quantify the transfer of EtG across the human placenta.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Alcohol is globally consumed, and its long term adverse effects on fetal development are well characterized. However, in utero alcohol exposure does not always result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study explores the role of ecogenetic and epigenetic factors in FASD. We hypothesize that ecogenetic and epigenetic factors determine susceptibility to FASD. Methods: To test this hypothesis we examined the prevalence of FASD between two disparate population groups; one in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada and the other in Moyo, Northern Uganda. Moyo was chosen because alcohol consumption in the district is especially widespread and yet alcohol-related behavioral and academic issues are rare. In PEI, FASD is a significant public health concern. Both Moyo and PEI are remote regions with stable populations of comparable size. Children aged 2 years to 10 years exposed in utero to alcohol as determined by maternal history were assessed by a dysmophologist/paediatrician for clinical features of FASD. Results: Fifty seven (57/87 or 65.5%) Moyo mothers and 49 (49/89 or 55%) PEI mothers admitted to consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Based on maternal history a total of 65 Moyo children and 52 PEI children were exposed in utero to alcohol. Twentysix or 40% Moyo children and 42 or 80% PEI children were confirmed to have FASD. Conclusions/Discussions: PEI children exposed in utero to alcohol are significantly more likely to have FASD than Moyo children (p<0.01). Differences in ecogenetic and epigenetic factors are postulated to be the explanation for the two-fold difference in FASD prevalence between Moyo and PEI children. These findings are preliminary and warrant further and larger studies that analyze ecogenetic and epigenetic factors that could influence risk susceptibility to FASD.

N2  - Background: The Neurobehavioral Screening Tool (NST) is a part of the National Screening Tool Kit for FASD. The NST is a parental rating scale consisting of ten questions identified by Nash et al. (2006) to be predictive of FASD based on the child's current behaviour. The purpose of this study was to field test the NST to determine how well it differentiates between children diagnosed with FASD, those with PAE but no FASD diagnosis, and typically developing controls. Methods: We administered the NST to three groups of children (6 to 17 years): 36 with FASD and 21 PAE assessed at the Glenrose Hospital FASD clinic in Edmonton, and 21 controls recruited locally. Results: Significantly more children with FASD screened positive on the NST compared to the PAE and the control group. The sensitivity of the NST in our sample was 36.1%. Within the FASD group, there was a higher sensitivity among older participants (50%) 12- 17 years, than younger participants (22%) 6-11 years. The NST had 100% specificity against the control group; none of the controls tested positively. Discussion: Despite overall low sensitivity, the specificity in our sample is very high indicating that the selected items are specific to FASD. This supports the use of the NST as a national screening tool which would lead to large numbers of children being screened and undergoing the process of diagnosis.

N2  - Background. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the strongest manifestation of FASD, results in short stature, microcephally and facial dysmorphogenesis including microphthalmia. One of the criteria for the diagnosis of FAS is the assessment of alcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to make a photo of drinking habits during pregnancy. Methods. Preliminary results of this survey are underway to 582 unselected pregnant women, of different nationalities, who refer at Department of Obstetrics Gynaecology Urology Science, Sapienza University of Rome. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered, assessing the unit of alcohol introduced by their daily habits as well as alterations of consumption during the pregnancy. Results. This study shows that before pregnancy, 68.5% consume alcohol regularly in quantities and of these 25.3% did not change their habits during pregnancy. We found that in the first trimester 33. 3% drink and 5. 6% of this intake whenever more than one drink. In the second, 35. 1% consume alcohol and 7. 5% of this intake more than one drink. Finally, in the third trimester on 37. 8% of women who drink, 3. 3% consume alcohol more than one drink. Conclusions. Most women do not know how much drinking during pregnancy is dangerous for fetus. There is currently no cure for FAS, so there is only one sure way to prevent fetal alcohol-related conditions: completely avoid the use of alcohol during pregnancy. The consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can harm the developing fetus at all stages of pregnancy. It is therefore important to have a wide program of education. And it is essential that physicians adequately sensitize women who are pregnant or intend to start.

N2  - Absorption of alcohol during gestation in human may give raise to fetal alcohol syndrome inducing facial abnormalities, growth and mental retardation and cognitive dysfunction not compensated by development. Preclinical studies so far showed that prenatal alcohol exposure impaired spatial learning in offspring, accompanied with lower activity-dependent plasticity due to deficits in excitatory amino-acid receptor function. Thus, these deficits have been related to lower synaptic hippocampus long-term potentiation but nothing is known about long-term depression (LTD). To test this hypothesis, Sprague-Dawley dams consumed 10% ethanol solution during both gestation and lactation. Experiments were performed on dorsal hippocampal slices (400 mum thick) prepared from adolescent/peri-adolescent rats (P38-P60) from the ethanol exposed, non-ethanol exposed and pairfed group. Extracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons were performed while stimuli were delivered using a bipolar stimulating electrode placed in the stratum radiatum. LTD was induced after low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 600 bursts, 10 min) and measurements were made for 120 min following plasticity induction. In CA1 hippocampal area from adolescent rats exposed pre- and postnatally to ethanol, intrinsic excitability and glutamate release were unaltered but an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-dependent LTD was facilitated. Our results demonstrate that this was due to an increased activity of NMDA receptors during stimulation that arises from (i) a deficit in Mg2+ voltage-dependent blockade and (ii) an overexpression of NR2B NMDA-receptor subunit. We also showed that this effect of ethanol on LTD facilitation was dependent upon protein synthesis. Ongoing experiments are currently analyzing the putative involvement of GABA neurotransmission. This unexpected increased in LTD may account for some cognitive deficits after in utero ethanol exposure.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) affects 0.2Y1% of the population (Sampson et al. 1997; US Department of Health and Human Services 2005). People with this disorder may demonstrate differential behavioral responses to stressful situations (Kodituwakku 2007, Hellmans 2010). As part of a series of studies on the interaction of stress and alcohol abuse, we aimed to test the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to ethanol predisposes individuals to the development of alcohol misuse following trauma exposure. Methods Used: Female C57BL/6J mice were allowed to binge drink a 10% ethanol solution for the duration of pregnancy. Six male offspring from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) litters and six male offspring from saccharin control litters were provided access to 20% ethanol solutions according to the Drinking In the Dark model described by Rhodes et al (2005) beginning at age 45-50 days. Binge drinking before and after two cycles of withdrawal were recorded. The third withdrawal cycle was coupled with exposure of the animals to a traumatic event via predator odor exposure after which binge drinking was again assessed. Summary of Results: Both PAE and control animals demonstrated a strong alcohol deprivation effect following the first withdrawal but not following the second withdrawal. Alcohol consumption increased in both groups following the traumatic exposure with the PAE animals trending toward a greater increase in drinking after trauma than the controls; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1635). Trauma-exposed mice maintained drinking levels, which is not seen after withdrawal cycles prior to trauma. There was a significant difference between the maintenance of drinking levels following the first, second and third withdrawal (with trauma) (p<0.0001) but, again, the PAE and control groups did not significantly differ from each other. Conclusions: Exposure to a traumatic event during adolescence increases binge drinking in both control and PAE C57BL/6J male mice. PAE mice show a heightened sensitivity to trauma, as evidenced by a greater increase in drinking which may reach statistical significance with a higher powered study.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Only a minority of children with heavy alcohol exposure in utero present with complete Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), yet others may suffer serious damage. We studied children with heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol to determine the prevalence of growth restriction, abnormal facies and CNS disability. Methods Used: Of 9,628 women questioned during their first prenatal appointment in Chile, 101 who consumed at least 4 drinks/day during their pregnancy were identified (exposed). Women matched for age and parity with no alcohol consumption during pregnancy formed the unexposed group (n=105). Children in both groups were evaluated for up to 8.5 years by clinicians blinded to exposure status. Not all children had data available in all three areas; partial data were included in the analysis resulting in different denominators. Statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher's exact test. Summary of Results: Of the 72 exposed children with sufficient data in all 3 areas, 4 (5.6%) were diagnosed with FAS whereas 31 (43.1%) had no abnormalities. CNS abnormalities were detected in 44.6% (33 of 74) of the exposed compared with 14.3% (12 of 84) of the unexposed children (p < 0.01). Growth restriction was present in 27.2% (25 of 92) of the exposed and 12.5% (12 of 96) of the unexposed (p = 0.02). Facial features consistent with the FAS phenotype were present in 17.3% (14 of 81) of the exposed children compared to 1.1 % (1 of 89) of the unex-posed children (p <0.01). Conclusions: In our study impaired CNS development was the most common problem, often occurring in the absence of facial or growth abnormalities. Heavy drinking during pregnancy is a serious problem and isolated neuro developmental delay may be the only sign to alert physicians to prenatal alcohol damage.

N2  - Objective: To assess the awareness and knowledge of Lebanese pregnant women about the risks of drinking during pregnancy and the factors that influence their drinking patterns. Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on a sample of 107 women consulting the gynecology outpatient department of Hotel-Dieu de France in Beirut, Lebanon, who completed the T-ACE screening test included in a 21 multiple choice questionnaire which examine knowledge and beliefs about alcohol use during pregnancy, drinking patterns and awareness of fetal alcohol exposure. Results: The 107 women of our sample were all married, between 20 and 41 years old and had mostly a high educational level (86%). Most of the women (47%) were at their first pregnancy. Of the 20 women who self-report drinking during pregnancy, 60% have obtained a positive score on the T-ACE questionnaire, which indicates that more than 11% of the women engage with potentially high risk drinking for the baby. There is not a significant difference between the different age categories or educational levels. This proportion is lower than the one found in international publications. However, the rate of excessive drinking (4 drinks or more on any one occasion in females) was higher and 1 woman in 5 reported excessive drinking in the previous year. There is a high level of knowledge that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the child, and the more consumption the more harmful and likely the effects, but there is confusion about the safety of small amounts of alcohol. 37% of the women think that there is a safe level of drinking during pregnancy; 29% tolerate up to 1 drink a month, 9% tolerate up to 1 drink a week and one woman thinks having one drink a day is safe. Women who actually drink during pregnancy are more likely to think that alcohol consumption to a certain level is safe. 31% of the women think that beer and/or wine are safe alcohols to a certain level during pregnancy. When asked about the source of this belief, 22% mention a gynecologist but the majority (61%) says it is a personal belief. 65% of the women in our sample are aware that alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to life-long disabilities in a child, such as delayed development (36%), birth defects/deformities (35%) and mental retardation (32%). However, up to 33% of the respondents report having no information about the effects of alcohol on the fetus and 2 women believe alcohol is not harmful at all. The women in our sample seem to be more aware of the necessity to stop smoking rather than stop drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Lebanese women are not fully aware of the recommendations and risks related to drinking during pregnancy, the reason why action must be taken to insure a better diffusion of these recommendations and better assessment of alcohol intake during prenatal visits.

N2  - Introduction: High alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) associated with fetal growth restriction, facial abnormalities and neurological problems. High ethanol concentrations affect the balance of apoptosis and proliferation in term placental tissue and cell lines, but effects in the fi rst trimester, the time crucial to placental development and organogenesis, are unknown. We hypothesised that placental cell turnover and amino acid transporter function are reduced after ethanol exposure. Methods: BeWo choriocarcinoma cells (n=6) were treated for 48h Scientifi c Abstracts and fi rst trimester placental explants (n=4) for 72h with ethanol (0-40mM) then assessed for cytokeratin-18 breakdown (M30) and cell proliferation (Ki67) using immunocytochemistry. Uptake of radiolabelled methylamino isobutyric acid (14C-MeAIB) and taurine (3H-taurine) were used to quantify System A and system beta transport activity. Results: Proliferation in BeWo cells was reduced by 5% with 20mM ethanol (P<0.05; Wilcoxon-signed rank). In fi rst trimester explants, cytotrophoblast proliferation decreased by 40% at 20mM (p<0.05). Ethanol had no effect on cytokeratin-18 breakdown. System beta activity was signifi cantly reduced at 10mM and 40mM ethanol in BeWo cells (p<0.05, least square linear regression). In contrast, there was a trend towards increased taurine uptake in fi rst trimester explants at 10mM (p=0.06; Wilcoxon-signed rank) but there was no signifi cant change at 20mM (p=0.1). System A activity did not signifi cantly change after treatment in either BeWo cells or fi rst trimester explants. Conclusion: These data suggest ethanol adversely affects placental development by reducing cytotrophoblast proliferation and altering uptake of taurine at concentrations mimicking moderate to high blood alcohol levels. However, the fi rst trimester tissue response to ethanol is more complex and requires further investigation. Ethanol exposure may therefore contribute to pathologies associated with FASD either by directly affecting placental growth or by indirectly altering transport of nutrients important in organogenesis.

N2  - Prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) depends on health care providers detecting maternal risk drinking in pregnancy. The T-ACE is a valid predictor of alcohol-related negative pregnancy outcome. We recently demonstrated that increasing the total T-ACE score criterion from 2 to 3 improved selectivity, identifying more non-drinking mothers and unaffected children with little loss in detection of drinkers and affected children. In this study, African American mothers (n=3008) in a longitudinal study of prenatal alcohol and child outcomes were administered the T-ACE at their first prenatal visit. Correlations were performed to identify relations between birth outcome and standard T-ACE (total score cutpoint = 2) and a new revised screen, the T-ACER3 (total score cutpoint = 3). Chi-square analyses determined improved predictive validity. Results identified significant relations between birth weight and birth length and both the T-ACE and T-ACER3 (birth weight: T-ACE = -.06; T-ACER3 = -.11; birth length: T-ACE = -.05; T-ACER3 = -.09; all p<.001) and the key craniofacial feature of FAS, palpebral fi ssure length (T-ACE = -.04, p<.04; T-ACER3 = -.08; p<.001). While both the T-ACE and the T-ACER3 significantly predicted birth size, T-ACER3 predictive ability was significantly better than the T-ACE (birth weight: chi2=11.0, p=.001; birth length chi2=6.9, p=.009; fi ssure length: chi2=6.0, p=.014). The T-ACER3, but not the standard T-ACE, was significantly related to lower gestational age (r=-.05, p<.001) and to prior pre-term delivery (r=-.10, p<.001). Finally, the T-ACER3 alone predicted lowered neonate maturity (Neurologic: r=-.07, p<.001, Physical: r=-.05, p=.003). Increasing the total score criterion from 2 to 3 in the T-ACER3 increased the screen's ability to identify negative alcohol-related birth outcomes. The more selective in-pregnancy screening of the revised T-ACER3 over the standard T-ACE can allow for more efficient Scientific Abstracts Reproductive Sciences Vol. 18, No. 4 (Supplement), March 2011 103A antenatal screening. Improved detection of fetal risk drinking affords better opportunities for intervention to reduce or eliminate maternal drinking and thereby minimize FASDs.

N2  - Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) describes the range of effects that may occur in an individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy, which include foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcoholrelated birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Information on the FASD in Australia is limited. Data from the Western Australian Birth Defects Registry showed a birth prevalence of FAS of 0.18/1,000 live births between 1980-1997, Aboriginal children being 100 times more likely than non-Aboriginal children to be diagnosed with FAS. In Australia, a prospective national surveillance study of FAS from 2001-2004 reported a birth prevalence of FAS of 0.06/1,000 live births (n = 92 cases). These rates are much lower than those reported in countries such as the USA, France and Sweden. A survey of paediatricians in Western Australia found that only 19% correctly identified the diagnostic features of FAS, which may explain the low rates. The national surveillance reported that the median age of diagnosis was 3.26 years, 40% were living with biological parents, 51% had a sibling with FAS and 65% were indigenous. The study found that one or more behavioural problems were reported in 49% of children and 28.3% were found to have emotional problems. These findings have implications for general and mental health services.

N2  - Introduction: The physical features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) include smooth philtrum, thin vermillion border, short palpebral fissures, microcephaly, and growth deficiency on weight and height. However, little is known about the specific quantities of alcohol exposure, pattern of drinking, timing of exposure, and magnitude of risk for each of these features. Methods: Using data on 992 subjects collected prospectively in California between 1978 and 2005, we examined the patterns and timing of alcohol exposure in relation to these features. Structural features were assessed by a dysmorphologist who performed a blinded physical examination of all infants. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0-6 weeks post-conception, 6-12 weeks postconception, second trimester, and third trimester. Results: Higher prenatal alcohol exposure in every pattern was significantly associated with the incidence of smooth philtrum but not short palpebral fissures. The strongest associations were with timing of exposure in the second half of the first trimester (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14-1.36 for average number of drinks per day; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.091.26 for maximum number of drinks in one episode), whereas there was no association with third trimester alcohol consumption. Similarly, thin vermillion border was most strongly associated with exposure in the second half of the first trimester. Findings with respect to timing of exposure were similar for microcephaly and reduced birth weight. However, reduced birth length was increased with exposure in any trimester. These associations were linear and there was no evidence of a threshold. Discussion: Reduced birth length and weight, microcephaly, smooth philtrum, and thin vermillion border are associated with specific gestational timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and are dose-related without evidence of a threshold. Women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol consumption from before conception throughout.

N2  - Introduction: The umbrella term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) encompasses a continuum of clinical presentations caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), Alcohol-related Birth Defects (ARBD), and Alcohol-related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND). In the absence of characteristic facial dysmorphia, confirmation of maternal drinking is required as a diagnostic criterion for pFAS, ARBD, and ARND. Primary prevention of FASD is often problematic due to difficulties of early identification of alcohol use among pregnant women in clinical settings given the limited reliability of maternal self-report. Methods: In this talk, I will provide an overview of the existing knowledge and results from our studies on the diagnosis of FASD and confirmation of prenatal alcohol exposure. Results: Increasing evidence indicates that the majority of children adversely affected by fetal alcohol exposure do not present with birth defects. Even in the case of full-blown FAS, recognition of more subjective physical features (i.e., smooth philtrum, long philtrum, presence of a "hockey-stick" palmar crease, and palpebral fissure length) often presents a problem for general pediatricians, as shown in our data generated from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD). The CIFASD study also identified novel ultrasound measures predictive of prenatal alcohol exposure. Confirmation of fetal alcohol exposure is problematic given that the majority of children with FASD are not diagnosed until they exhibit neurodevelopmental delays in school. Even when FASD is suspected in the newborn period, accurate confirmation of maternal drinking is difficult. Currently, interest is heightened with respect to biomarkers of alcohol exposure, analysis of direct ethanol metabolites in novel media, e.g., maternal and/or newborn hair, umbilical cord, nail clippings, and dried blood spots collected during the routine newborn genetic screening. Discussion: Early and accurate diagnosis of FASD children is a strong predictive factor against secondary disabilities such as mental health problems, disrupted school experience, delinquency and incarceration, inappropriate sexual behavior, and substance abuse problems. A battery of alcohol biomarkers, in combination with other clinical measures, can provide a unique opportunity for a point-of-care identification of pregnant women and children at risk.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CNS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. To improve FASD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, much remains to be learned from basic and clinical research. Recently, application of high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; a technique that provides for accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; a method that allows CNS fiber tract reconstruction and analyses) to an FASD mouse model has proven valuable in better defining the spectrum of dysmorpholgy that results from acute ethanol exposure during early stages of prenatal development. Using these imaging methodologies both fetal and adolescent mice have been examined, with the structural alterations resulting from maternal ethanol treatment on days 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 of pregnancy being the focus of these investigations. Stage-dependent permanent CNS damage that includes deficiency of the ventromedian forebrain, hippocampus and corpus callosum has been illustrated. Additionally, cerebro-cortical and periventricular heterotopias have been identified. The functional consequences of these defects are currently being examined. MRI has also been applied to fetal mice for analyses of ethanol-induced facial dysmorphology and has allowed identification of correspondence between the character and severity of abnormalities of the upper midface and those of the brain. Establishing that the identified brain and facial changes are consistent with those in FASD and that these defects result from insult at developmental stages that are present prior to typical human pregnancy recognition strongly supports the need for pre-pregnancy counseling and education regarding alcohol consumption. With respect to such an education-based FASD prevention effort, a middle school curriculum has been developed and distributed (http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Science/curriculum.html) and a high school curriculum is currently being completed. Each of these curricula employs a hands-on science approach and emphasizes the message that maternal alcohol use even prior to the time that most pregnancies are recognized can cause serious permanent damage to the conceptus.

N2  - The Fitzroy Valley is located ~500 km east of Broome in the remote Kim-berley region of WA, with Fitzroy Crossing town at its centre. The valley is home to ~4500 predominantly Aboriginal people belonging to 5 main language groups (Bunuba, Walmajarri/Wangkatjungka, Nyikina and Goonyandi) and living in >45 remote communities located up to 190 km from Fitzroy Crossing. In 2007, Fitzroy Valley communities were in crisis with high rates of alcohol abuse, alcohol-related harms, violence and crime. Courageous women successfully lobbied for restrictions on take-away of full strength alcohol and the subsequent health and social benefits have been well documented. Following a Women's Bush Meeting in 2008, the community identified the need to address FASD - the legacy of alcohol use in pregnancy - as a priority. In October 2008, a FASD leadership team was formed and in November 2008 they embraced a 'circle of friends' - partners in government, business and community organisations - and developed a strategy to address FASD and early life trauma. The strategy, called Marulu, includes diagnosis and prevention of FASD, community education, and support for parents and carers. Marulu is a Bunuba word meaning "precious, worth nurturing". In 2009, we were invited to help progress the strategy and conduct a FASD prevalence study called The Lililwan Project. Lililwan is a Kriol (Aboriginal English) word meaning "all the little ones". In October 2009, following extensive community consultation that confirmed this research as a priority, we formally accepted the invitation. The films Yajillarra (meaning "to dream") and Marulu will be shown and discussed. Yajillarra, which tells the story of the alcohol restrictions, was lauded when shown at the UN forum for Indigenous peoples and the Status of Women. The films were directed by Melanie Hogan, filmed by Caroline Constantine and produced by Jane Latimer.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with mental retardation and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced damage including fetal death, growth abnormalities and learning impairment in part through preventing alcohol-induced alterations in NMDA gene expressiON Given the role of cytokines and chemokines on NMDA receptors, we evaluated a panel in a model of FAS to evaluate their role and if the neuroprotective peptides NAP+SAL work through preventing these alterations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8(E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides. Embryos were harvested 24h later on gestational day 9 and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines and chemokines were measured using a microspherebased multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis,P<.05 significant. RESULTS: After 6h the chemokine KC and IL-6 levels were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median 15.7,range 10.1- 45.9pg/ml) and KC (median 45.9,range 32.5-99.1pg/ml). Embryos exposed to alcohol+NAP+SAL,had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P<.003), similar to control. Alcohol exposure resulted in elevated levels of G-CSF, treatment with NAP+SAL prevented the alcoholinduced increase (all P<.003). IL-13 and IL-1b were decreased 6h after alcohol exposure, exposure to alcohol+NAP+SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18 (10d after exposure), these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (RANTES, TNF-a, IFN-g, IL4) were not detectable at either timepoint in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL6, G-CSF and the chemokine KC which are known to affect NMDA receptors. NAP+SAL treatment prevented alcoholinduced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP+SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. We have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure decreases the expression of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT). These antioxidant enzymes are located in the brain and have promoter regions that can be genomically silenced by epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA hypermethylation. Our objective was to evaluate if the decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes in the brains of fetal mice was a function of DNA hypermethylation. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with intraperitoneal injection of saline (control) or alcohol (0.03 mL/g). Pups were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18), their brains extracted and homogenized. Each brain was analyzed individually. Real-time PCR was performed using methylation sensitive and dependent restriction enzymes to quantify methylation patterns for SOD, GPx and CAT. Data are reported as median [interquartile interval] and Mann-Whitney U was used for statistical analysis (significance: p< 0.05). RESULTS: 25 pups from 4 litters in the alcohol group and 23 pups from 5 litters in the saline group were analyzed. There was no difference in maternal or pup weight between the two groups. In utero alcohol exposure increased the percentage of DNA hypermethylation in the promoter regions of SOD compared to saline (2.89%[1.50 - 5.34] vs. 1.7%[0.79 - 2.34]; Figure. p= 0.03). No effect was seen in the GPx or CAT promoters (p = 0.94 and 0.55 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The previously characterized impaired expression of brain SOD in FAS can be due to DNA hypermethylation in the promoter region. Epigenetic modification may provide a new strategy for prevention of the long term morbidity of FAS.(Figure presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with mental retardation and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced damage in FAS including fetal death, growth abnormalities and learning impairment. Fractalkine, a chemokine constitutively expressed in neurons throughout the CNS, has a role in neuroprotection reducing neuronal death from activated microglia. Using a model of FAS we evaluated if fractalkine is altered in FAS and if the neuroprotective peptides NAP+SAL work through preventing alterations in fractalkine. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides. Embryos were harvested 24h later on gestational day 9 and 10 days later at E18. Fractalkine was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis with P P< .05 significant. RESULTS: Six hours after alcohol exposure, fractalkine levels were signficantly elevated(median 341pg/ml, range 263-424pg/ml) vs controls (median 228pg/ml, range 146-332pg/ml; P P< .001; Figure). Embryos treated with alcohol and the peptides NAP+SAL prevented the alcohol induced increase in fractalkine (median 137, range 97-255 pg/ml, P< .001). At E18 (10d after exposure), fractalkine levels were similar in all groups (medians 1821, 1852 and 2013 pg/ml respectively, P=0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in elevation of the neuroprotective chemokine fractalkine, perhaps in an effort to counter the alcohol toxicity. Treatment with the peptides NAP+SAL along with the alcohol prevents the acute increase in fractalkine.(Figure presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. Oxygen consumption in the brain results in generation of free radicals and this effect is magnified in response to alcohol. Antioxidative enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) function to prevent the cellular damage produced by free radicals. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of prenatal alcohol on antioxidant enzyme expression. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with intraperitoneal injection of saline (control) or alcohol (0.03 mL/g). Pups were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18), their brains extracted and homogenized. Each fetal brain was analyzed individually for mRNA expression of SOD, GPx and CAT using realtime PCR with 18S for internal control. Student t test was used for statistical analysis (significance: p<0.05). RESULTS: 25 pups from 4 litters in the alcohol group and 23 pups from 5 litters in the saline group were analyzed. There was no difference in maternal or pup weight between the two groups. SOD, GPx and CAT mRNA expression was significantly lower in the alcohol group compared to controls (Figure, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure inhibits SOD, GPx and CAT expression. The reduction in these antioxidant enzymes promotes an oxidant environment and contributes to the cytotoxicity associated with FAS. The antioxidant system may be a novel pathway to target for prevention of the long term morbidity of FAS. (Graff Presented).

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes wide range of behavioral and structural deficits in children, commonly known as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Children with FAS may suffer behavioral deficits in the absence of obvious malformations. In rodents, the exposure to alcohol during gestation changes brain structures and weights of offspring. The mechanism of FAS is not completely understood. In the present study, an established rat (Long-Evans) model of FAS was used. The litter size and the weights of mothers, fetuses and placentas were examined on gestation days 18 or 20. On gestation day 18, the effects of chronic alcohol on the expression levels of integrin receptor subunits, phospholipase-C and N-cadherin were examined in the fetal cerebral cortices. Presence of alcohol in the liquid-diet reduced the consumption and decreased weights of mothers and fetuses but increased the placental weights. Expression levels of (beta1 and alpha3 integrin subunits and phospholipase-C2 were significantly altered in the fetal cerebral cortices of mothers on alcohol containing diet. Results show that alcohol consumption during pregnancy even with protein, mineral and vitamin enriched diet may affect maternal and fetal health, and alter integrin receptor signaling pathways in the fetal cerebral cortex disturbing the development of fetal brains.

T1  - Intervention for individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Treatment approaches and case management

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol in utero is considered to be the leading cause of developmental disabilities of known etiology. The most severe consequence of such exposure, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), is characterized by a distinct constellation of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation, and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Some individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) do not meet the full criteria for FAS, but instead are diagnosed with partial FAS, alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), or alcohol related birth defects (ARBD). The entire continuum of effects from PAE is increasingly being referred to under the umbrella term of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). An extensive body of research has documented major cognitive, behavioral, adaptive, social, and emotional impairments among individuals with FASDs. Although FAS was identified in the U.S. over 35 years ago, the development, evaluation, and dissemination of evidencebased interventions for individuals with FASDs have lagged behind significantly. Encouragingly, however, in recent years there has been a marked increase in efforts to design and test interventions to remediate the impairments associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This article will review treatment needs and considerations for individuals with FASDs and their families, current empirically tested treatment approaches, case management issues, and suggestions for future directions in research on the treatment of FASDs. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - The life-long neurological impairments found in people with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), including learning disabilities, impulsivity, hyperactivity, social ineptness, and poor judgment, can increase susceptibility to victimization and involvement in the criminal justice system (CJS). Individuals with FASDs become involved in the CJS as complainants, witnesses, and accused. Their disabilities, resulting from the prenatal alcohol exposure, must be considered at all stages in the legal process. Adverse experiences, such as having a dysfunctional family background, mental health problems, and substance use disorders, are compounding factors. Experiencing physical, sexual, and emotional abuse also increases the risk that these individuals will become involved in the CJS. It is critical that everyone involved in the CJS receives education and training to understand FASD and the implications for the individual offender. A comprehensive medical-legal report, prepared by professionals experienced with FASD, can help judges and lawyers understand the complex interactions among brain damage, genetics and the environment. Corrections workers and probation officers need to comprehend the significance of FASD and how it affects the offender's abilities to understand and follow rules and probation orders. Caregivers and parents need to be involved whenever possible. Early recognition of the disabilities associated with FASDs may help reduce the over-representation of this group in the CJS. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) over 35 years ago, mounting evidence about the impact of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has prompted increased attention to the link between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a constellation of developmental disabilities that are characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. These disabilities include a continuum of developmental disorders known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Longitudinal studies suggest that individuals with FASDs are at a greatly increased risk for adverse long-term outcomes, including mental health problems and poor social adjustment. This review summarizes the existing literature on mental health outcomes for individuals with PAE across the lifespan, including findings in infancy and early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence and early adulthood. Research on the psychiatric disabilities suffered by individuals with FASDs throughout development highlights the need for training of mental health professionals in the identification and the provision of specific treatments to address the unique features of this developmental disability since early identification and treatment have been demonstrated to be protective against more serious secondary disabilities. It is hoped that with greater awareness of the mental health problems experienced by individuals with FASDs, these individuals can receive appropriate and early treatment resulting in more adaptive and rewarding lives. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - The detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain include structural brain anomalies as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits. Initial neuroimaging studies of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed previous autopsy reports of overall reduction in brain volume and central nervous system (CNS) disorganization, with specific structural abnormalities of the corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate, and hippocampus. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed detection of regional increases in cortical thickness and gray matter volume along with decreased volume and disorganization of white matter in individuals with FASD. In addition, functional imaging studies have found functional and neurochemical differences in those prenatally exposed to alcohol. Behavioral alterations noted in individuals with FASD are consistent with the findings noted in the brain imaging studies. Continued neuroimaging studies are needed to further advance understanding of the neuroteratogenic effects of alcohol. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Alcohol use among women of childbearing age is a leading, preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. Although most women reduce their alcohol use upon pregnancy recognition, some women report drinking during pregnancy and others may continue to drink prior to realizing they are pregnant. These findings emphasize the need for effective prevention strategies for both pregnant and nonpregnant women who might be at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). This report reviews evidence supporting alcohol screening and brief intervention as an effective approach to reducing problem drinking and AEPs that can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. In addition, this article highlights a recent report of the National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect that describes effective interventions to reduce alcohol use and AEPs, and outlines recommendations on promoting and improving these strategies. Utilizing evidence-based alcohol screening tools and brief counseling for women at risk for an AEP and other effective population-based strategies can help achieve future alcohol-free pregnancies. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Until relatively recently these purposes have not changed and have at times been at odds with one another, resulting in collisions among policies and practices in science, medicine, public policy and the law. One area in which this has been particularly true is that of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) where the adverse consequences of consumed alcohol on children in the womb and after birth may have been observed since antiquity, but the actions taken based on such observations have been influenced as much by the socio/cultural/political context of the times in which they were made as by evidence of harm. This article provides an overview of the inherent confusion when new scientific findings confront prevailing medical practice, the history involved in this confusion with respect to FASD, including public policy and legal issues that have arisen around alcohol and pregnancy, and the research and clinical challenges still being faced.

N2  - Introduction: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, malformation of the fetus, diverse behavioural problems in newborns, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and learning disorder. Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted in Korea to investigate alcohol consumption and factors influencing drinking behaviour during pregnancy in Korean women. Therefore, a survey was conducted on pregnant women to investigate whether they drank alcohol and to identify factors predictive of drinking behaviour during pregnancy. Method: Pregnant women at less than 30 days before expected delivery who visited 3 obstetric and gynecology hospitals (a university hospital, a specialized hospital, and a clinic) were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire. Demographic (age, education, job, income, religion etc.) and obstetric characteristics (primipara or multipara, whether they wanted the pregnancy or not), and smoking history (cigarette smoking before and after the realization of pregnancy, frequency of smoking, average amount smoked and family history of smoking) were investigated, as were alcoholic history (consumption of alcohol before and after the realization of pregnancy, frequency of drinking, average amount consumed, and awareness that consuming alcohol during pregnancy is harmful). Results: 1) Six hundred and ninety five subjects of average age 30.8+/-3.8 years were enrolled. 2) One hundred forty one subjects visited to a university hospital, 496 subjects visited to a specialized clinic, and 58 subjects visited to a clinic. 3) Of these subjects, 25.7% had completed up to high school education and 37.6% had a job. 67.9% were primiparous, and 99.4% were aware that consuming alcohol during pregnancy is harmful. 4) Five hundred seventy eight (83.2%) and 173 subjects (24.9%), respectively, consumed alcohol before becoming pregnant and after they were aware of being pregnant. 5) Ninety seven (14.2% of 685 subjects) and 20 subjects (2.9% of 689 subjects), respectively, smoked before becoming pregnant and after they were aware of being pregnant. 6) Those that had consumed alcohol before becoming pregnant (chi2=107.21, p < 0.001, OR= 68.85), those that smoked before becoming pregnant (chi2=4.98, p = 0.025, OR=3.31) and those with a family history of smoking (chi2=8.06, p = 0.004, OR=2.29) were found to be more likely to drink alcohol when pregnant. Conclusion: This study shows that a quarter of pregnant Korean women aware of their status consume alcohol, and that 3 factors, alcohol drinking before becoming pregnant, cigarette smoking before becoming pregnant and family history of cigarette smoking, are predictive of drinking behaviour during pregnancy. These results strongly suggest that an anti-drinking educational strategy should be devised to target women of childbearing potential, in particular, those at high risk. (table presented).

N2  - We explored differences in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors across six groups of professionals in key position to provide primary and secondary prevention efforts (physicians, educators, correctional staff, social workers, public health nurses, and substance abuse counselors). Achieving a 60.1% response rate, 2,292 professionals returned surveys, providing data on basic knowledge of FAS, FASD-associated risks and cognitive deficits, and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women. Across groups, findings revealed ample FASD knowledge and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women that increases as consumption becomes more frequent and severe. However, results revealed significant between-group differences data that provide valuable guidance for targeted future FASD education efforts. Public health initiatives regarding FASD have been effective in increasing knowledge among a broad range of professionals. However, between-group differences indicate the need for targeted, discipline-specific interventions. These differences highlight the need for all professional groups to provide a consistent public health message regarding maternal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can alter physical and behavioral development, leading to a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Despite warning labels, pregnant women continue to drink alcohol, creating a need to identify effective interventions to reduce the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects. Choline is an essential nutrient that influences brain and behavioral development. Recent studies indicate that choline supplementation can reduce the teratogenic effects of developmental alcohol exposure. The present study examined whether choline supplementation during prenatal ethanol treatment could mitigate the adverse effects of ethanol on behavioral development. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated with 6 g/kg/day ethanol in a binge-like manner from gestational days 5-20; pair-fed and ad libitum chow controls were included. During treatment, subjects from each group were intubated with either 250 mg/kg/day choline chloride or vehicle. Spontaneous alternation, parallel bar motor coordination, Morris water maze, and spatial working memory were assessed in male and female offspring. Subjects prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibited delayed development of spontaneous alternation behavior and deficits on the working memory version of the Morris water maze during adulthood, effects that were mitigated with prenatal choline supplementation. Neither alcohol nor choline influenced performance on the motor coordination task. These data indicate that choline supplementation during prenatal alcohol exposure may reduce the severity of fetal alcohol effects, particularly on alterations in tasks that require behavioral flexibility. These findings have important implications for children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Alcohol exposure in pregnancy is a common and modifiable risk factor for poor pregnancy and child outcomes. Alcohol exposure in pregnancy can cause a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems in the child including the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). In order to improve prevention strategies, we sought to describe the knowledge and attitudes of women of childbearing age regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus. We conducted a national cross-sectional survey via computer assisted telephone interview of 1103 Australian women aged 18 to 45 years. Participants were randomly selected from the Electronic White Pages. Pregnant women were not eligible to participate. Quotas were set for age groups and a minimum of 100 participants per state to ensure a national sample reflecting the population. The questionnaire was based on a Health Canada survey with additional questions constructed by the investigators. Descriptive statistics were calculated and logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations with participants' knowledge and attitudes. Of women surveyed, 61.5% had heard about effects of alcohol on the fetus and 55.3% had heard of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Although 92.7% agreed alcohol can affect the unborn child, 16.2% did not agree that the disabilities could be lifelong. Most women agreed that pregnant women should not drink alcohol (80.2%) and 79.2% reported having negative feelings towards pregnant women drinking alcohol. Women with higher education levels were more likely to know the effects of alcohol consumption in pregnancy (adjusted OR 5.62; 95% CI 3.20 to 9.87) but education level and knowledge were not associated with attitude. There was a disjunction between knowledge and attitudes towards alcohol consumption in pregnancy. These findings will assist in developing effective health promotion campaigns to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and subsequent fetal damage.

N2  - Psychological distress (PD) includes symptoms of depression and anxiety and is associated with considerable emotional suffering, social dysfunction and, often, with problematic alcohol use. The rate of current PD among American Indian women is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of U.S. women in general. Our study aims to fill the current knowledge gap about the prevalence and characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems among American Indian mothers whose children were referred to screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data was conducted from maternal interviews of referred American Indian mothers (n = 152) and a comparison group of mothers (n = 33) from the same Plains culture tribes who participated in an NIAAA-funded epidemiology study of FASD. Referred women were from one of six Plains Indian reservation communities and one urban area who bore children suspected of having an FASD. A 6-item PD scale (PD-6, Cronbach's alpha = .86) was constructed with a summed score range of 0-12 and a cut-point of 7 indicating serious PD. Multiple statistical tests were used to examine the characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems. Referred and comparison mothers had an average age of 31.3 years but differed (respectively) on: education (<high school: 47.4%, 9.1%), PD-6 mean scores (3.57, 1.48), current prevalence of serious PD (19.1%, 0.0%), and a current drinking problem (31.6%, 12.1%). Among referred mothers, those with a current drinking problem had a significantly higher mean PD-6 score. Having PD, serious PD, and 2 specific scale items significantly increased the odds that a referred mother would have a current drinking problem. Psychological distress among referred mothers is significantly associated with having a self-reported drinking problem. FASD prevention requires multi-level prevention efforts that provide real opportunities for educational attainment and screening and monitoring of PD and alcohol use during the childbearing years. Mixed methods studies are needed to illuminate the social and cultural determinants at the base of the experience of PD and to identify the strengths and protective factors of unaffected peers who reside within the same communities.

N2  - In the last 40 years a vast mass of clinical, epidemiological and experimental evidence has demonstrated that alcohol is a teratogenic agent and that its consumption during gestation can cause foetal death, malformations and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in the exposed fetus. The most dramatic presentation is the complete foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is observed in children born from heavy alcohol consuming mothers. FAS and of other fetal alcohol-related effects was reported in both USA and Europe in the middle 80 s. However, despite these evidences, many European countries have largely forgotten or minimize the risks associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. Thirty years later, new epidemiological and clinical studies as well as new biomarkers of fetal-alcohol damage have identified high risk populations and have provided data demonstrating that significant number of women in the EU drink during pregnancy. In September of 2009, a conference on 'ALCOHOL AND PREGNANCY' was organized sponsored by the Swedish Presidency of the European Union, to discuss political interventions in the EU concerning this question. I briefly summarize here the discussions, presentations and the prevention programs of some European countries. The main conclusion of the conference was that we need more information and prevention programs to improve prevention of the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption during gestation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the educational effects of a single leaflet distributed once without explanation of its content. METHODS: All the 58 seniors on a dietitian course and all the 81 students who took "health and nutrition" as their elective in a women's university in F Prefecture were recruited. They were assigned to intervention or control groups. Both groups were asked the following choice questions in a baseline survey: "What do you think about alcohol drinking during pregnancy?" "What do you suppose you yourself will do in the future?" and "Do you know about the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)?" One month later, a leaflet was distributed to the intervention group only. One week after the distribution, a second questionnaire was administered to both groups. The leaflet and the two questionnaires were distributed and collected during class with the help of teaching staff. The leaflet was made by a NPO and it recommended stopping drinking when planning to become pregnant. RESULTS: The participation rate was 83%. There were no significant associations between groups and grades, current drinking habit, and learning experience on this topic. Almost 80% of the intervention group read the leaflet. Change in their thinking about drinking during pregnancy before and after the intervention did not significantly differ between the two groups. Compared to 57 controls, 66 students who received the leaflet showed significant improved changes in their attitudes toward drinking during pregnancy and the knowledge about FAS. CONCLUSIONS: No significant change in their thinking about drinking during pregnancy could be due to the fact that, even before the intervention, nearly 80% of the students thought pregnant women must abstain from alcohol entirely. This might be related to the sample characteristics, since 75% of them were majoring in nutrition. The improvement in attitudes was considered to reflect the content of the leaflet. In the intervention group, the percentage of the students who chose the alternative of "I plan to stop drinking when I wish to get pregnant" increased as the leaflet recommended and more than half of them said they learned about FAS by this leaflet. To sum up, even a single distribution of a leaflet in a school setting had educational effects which improved attitude and knowledge. Since the current sample seemed to have particular knowledge and interest in health, it is now necessary to examine effects of the same approach in the general population.

N2  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) were determined in 602 meconium samples in a maternal health evaluation study for detection of gestational alcohol consumption. A validated headspace solid phase microextraction method in combination with GC-MS was used for FAEE and the cumulative concentration of ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate with a cut-off of 500 ng/g was applied for interpretation. A new and simple method was developed and validated for quantification of EtG from 10-20 mg meconium with D 5-EtG as internal standard consisting of 30 min. extraction with methanol/water (1:1, v/v), evaporation of methanol, filtration of the aqueous solution through a cellulose filter and injection into LC-MS-MS. The limits of detection and quantification for EtG were 10 and 30 ng/g, the recovery 86.6 to 106.4% and the standard deviation of the concentrations ranged from 13% at 37 ng/g to 5% at 46,700 ng/g (N = 6). FAEE above the cut-off were found in 43 cases (7.1%) with cumulative concentrations between 507 and 22,580 ng/g and with one outlier of about 150,000 ng/g (EtG not detected). EtG was detected in 97 cases (16.3%) and concentrations between LOD and 10,200 ng/g with another outlier of 82,000 ng/g (FAEE 10,500 ng/g). Optimal agreement between the two markers was obtained with a cut-off for EtG of 274 ng/g and 547 cases with both FAEE- and EtG-negative, 33 cases with both FAEE- and EtG-positive, nine cases with FAEE-positive and EtG-negative, and seven cases with FAEE-negative and EtG-positive. Differences in physical, chemical, and biochemical properties and in the pharmacokinetic behavior are discussed as reasons for the deviating cases. In none of the 602 cases, serious alcohol consumption was reported by the mothers and no evidence for gestational ethanol exposure was observed in the medical investigation of the newborns. It is concluded that the combined use of FAEE and EtG in meconium as markers for fetal alcohol exposure essentially increases the accuracy of the interpretation and helps to avoid false positive and false-negative results. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure triggers ceramide-induced apoptosis in neural crest-derived tissues concurrent with defective cranial development
A1  - Wang G.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The reason why specific embryonic tissues are sensitive toward ethanol is not understood. We found that in neural crest-derived cell (NCC) cultures from the first branchial arch of E10 mouse embryos, incubation with ethanol increases the number of apoptotic cells by fivefold. Apoptotic cells stain intensely for ceramide, suggesting that ceramide-induced apoptosis mediates ethanol damage to NCCs. Apoptosis is reduced by incubation with CDP-choline (citicoline), a precursor for the conversion of ceramide to sphingomyelin. Consistent with NCC cultures, ethanol intubation of pregnant mice results in ceramide elevation and increased apoptosis of NCCs in vivo. Ethanol also increases the protein level of prostate apoptosis response 4 (PAR-4), a sensitizer to ceramide-induced apoptosis. Prenatal ethanol exposure is concurrent with malformation of parietal bones in 20% of embryos at day E18. Meninges, a tissue complex derived from NCCs, is disrupted and generates reduced levels of TGF-beta1, a growth factor critical for bone and brain development. Ethanol-induced apoptosis of NCCs leading to defects in the meninges may explain the simultaneous presence of cranial bone malformation and cognitive retardation in FAS. In addition, our data suggest that treatment with CDP-choline may alleviate the tissue damage caused by alcohol. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is the most severe consequence of alcohol on the fetus in the prenatal period, has been described in the French medical literature by Lemoine in 1968. Five years later, Jones and his colleagues were the first researchers to show a link between alcohol abuse by pregnant women and specific characteristics of birth defects. This work formed a basis for further research to identify diagnostic criteria. Since that time, several proposals for diagnosis have been developed, aimed at an accurate survey of a wide range of physical and behavioural anomalies resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol. The diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a real challenge. Patients after prenatal exposure to alcohol exhibit a wide range of symptoms, most of which are not specific only for prenatal intoxication and often manifest themselves in various ways throughout life. In Poland the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is sporadic and because of the lack of access to objective diagnostic tools and professional literature in Polish the diagnosis is based on the investigator's subjective assessment and the diagnoses issued in different centres may differ. As a result, many people with FASD live without a correct diagnosis or as a result of misdiagnosis (e.g. autism, ADHD, behavioural disorders, etc.) they receive improper treatment. The purpose of this publication is to present the development of diagnostic methods in the world and in Poland with particular emphasis on 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. © 2010 by Medical Communications.

N2  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are birth defects directly linked to consumption of alcohol during pregnancy and hence completely preventable. Many health and allied health professionals are in prime positions for primary prevention of FASDs through work with women of childbearing age and secondary prevention through work with affected individuals whose lives can be greatly improved via tailored intervention. Objectives To develop educational guidelines for FASD prevention. Methods Interviews were conducted with 26 individuals representing eight health or allied health professions. Participants were asked about professional groups with which they had sufficient experience to describe FASD-related competencies and educational needs for the given group(s). For each group, participants were asked for their perceptions of group members' FASD awareness, knowledge, and skills application as related to the seven core competencies for FASD practice developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results Findings revealed that competence, especially when viewed separately in terms of knowledge versus capacity for application of information, in the area of FASDs is unevenly distributed among and throughout healthcare provider groups. Conclusion Based on this information, recommendations are offered for optimal health and allied health education efforts to prevent and treat FASDs, framed along FASD core competencies recommended by the CDC. ©2010 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

T1  - Paternal genetic contribution influences fetal vulnerability to maternal alcohol consumption in a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
A1  - Sittig L.J.
A1  - Redei E.E.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol exposure causes in the offspring a collection of permanent physiological and neuropsychological deficits collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The timing and amount of exposure cannot fully explain the substantial variability among affected individuals, pointing to genetic influences that mediate fetal vulnerability. However, the aspects of vulnerability that depend on the mother, the father, or both, are not known. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) and inbred Brown Norway (BN) rat strains as well as their reciprocal crosses, we administered ethanol (E), pair-fed (PF), or control (C) diets to the pregnant dams. The dams' plasma levels of free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), free T3 (fT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured to elucidate potential differences in maternal thyroid hormonal environment, which affects specific aspects of FASD. We then compared alcohol-exposed, pair fed, and control offspring of each fetal strain on gestational day 21 (G21) to identify maternal and paternal genetic effects on bodyweight and placental weight of male and female fetuses. Conclusions: SD and BN dams exhibited different baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function. Moreover, the thyroid function of SD dams was more severely affected by alcohol consumption while that of BN dams was relatively resistant. This novel finding suggests that genetic differences in maternal thyroid function are one source of maternal genetic effects on fetal vulnerability to FASD. The fetal vulnerability to decreased bodyweight after alcohol exposure depended on the genetic contribution of both parents, not only maternal contribution as previously thought. In contrast, the effect of maternal alcohol consumption on placental weight was consistent and not strain-dependent. Interestingly, placental weight in fetuses with different paternal genetic contributions exhibited opposite responses to caloric restriction (pair feeding). In summary, these novel findings demonstrate both maternal and paternal genetic contributions to in utero vulnerability to alcohol, refining our understanding of the genetically-based heterogeneity seen in human FASD. © 2010 Sittig, Redei.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Prenatal ethanol (ETOH) exposure can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We previously showed that ETOH alters cell adhesion molecule gene expression and increases neurosphere size in fetal brain-derived neural stem cells (NSC). Here, our aim was to determine the effect of ETOH on the cell fate of NSC, premature glial-committed precursor cells (GCP), and premature neuron-committed progenitor cells (NCP). Methods: NSC, GCP, and NCP were isolated from normal second-trimester fetal human brains (n = 3) by positive selection using magnetic microbeads labeled with antibodies to CD133 (NSC), A2B5 (GCP), or PSA-NCAM (NCP). As a result of the small percentage in each brain, NSC were cultured in mitogenic media for 72 hours to produce neurospheres. The neurospheres from NSC and primary isolates of GCP and NCP were used for all experiments. Equal numbers of the 3 cell types were treated either with mitogenic media or with differentiating media, each containing 0 or 100 mM ETOH, for 120 hours. Expression of Map2a, GFAP, and O4 was determined by immunoflourescence microscopy and western blot analysis. Fluorescence intensities were quantified using Metamorph software by Molecular Devices, and the bands of western blots were quantified using densitometry. Results: ETOH in mitogenic media promoted formation of neurospheres by NSC, GCP, and NCP. Under control conditions, GCP attached and differentiated, NSC and NCP formed neurospheres that were significantly smaller in size than those in ETOH. Under differentiating conditions, Map2a expression increased significantly in NSC and GCP and reduced significantly in NCP, and GFAP expression reduced significantly in GCP and NCP, and Gal-C expression reduced significantly in all 3 cell types in the presence of ETOH compared to controls. Conclusions: This study shows that ETOH alters the cell fate of neuronal stem and progenitor cells. These alterations could contribute to the mechanism for the abnormal brain development in FASD. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: A primary goal of recent research is the development of neurobehavioral profiles that specifically define fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which may assist differential diagnosis or improve treatment. In the current study, we define a preliminary profile using neuropsychological data from a multisite study. Methods: Data were collected using a broad neurobehavioral protocol from 2 sites of a multisite study of FASD. Subjects were children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and unexposed controls. The alcohol-exposed group included children with and without fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). From 547 neuropsychological variables, 22 variables were selected for analysis based on their ability to distinguish children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls. These data were analyzed using latent profile analysis (LPA). Results: The results indicated that a 2-class model best fit the data. The resulting profile was successful at distinguishing subjects with FAS from nonexposed controls without FAS with 92% overall accuracy; 87.8% of FAS cases and 95.7% of controls were correctly classified. The same analysis was repeated with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure but without FAS and nonexposed controls with similar results. The overall accuracy was 84.7%; 68.4% of alcohol-exposed cases and 95% of controls were correctly classified. In both analyses, the profile based on neuropsychological variables was more successful at distinguishing the groups than was IQ alone. Conclusions: We used data from 2 sites of a multisite study and a broad neuropsychological test battery to determine a profile that could be used to accurately identify children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Results indicated that measures of executive function and spatial processing are especially sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can seriously harm the fetus, dependent on time, duration and frequency of exposure. The variety of outcomes is subsumed under the term >>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders<< (FASD). Diagnostic classification by means of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code results from the occurence of four key characteristics: Growth retardation, facial anomalies, CNS abnormalities (microcephaly, mental retardation, functional problems and behavioral problems) and prenatal alcohol exposure. As the facial characteristics are often discrete, the focus lies on the behavioral problems. Foster parents (most of the affected children do not stay with their biological parents) are overstrained by the everyday life with their alcohol affected children. An early diagnosis is necessary to release the foster families and to develop an appropriate concept for supporting the children according to their capabilities. Therefore a supportive network of attending pediatricians, >>Sozialpadiatrische Zentren<<, therapists and youth welfare offices with specific support for foster parents. This network aims at avoiding the adverse development and the multiple punishment of the affected children by brain dysfunction, postnatal traumatic experiences in the birth families and the danger of anew breakups of relationships due to the serious behavioral problems. Regarding pregnancy care there has to be a paradigm shift in sense of an alcohol abstinence imperative during pregnancy and early identification and treatment of (potentially) alcohol consuming pregnant women. Gynaecologists, midwives and addiction therapists are to be involved. The allover admission of alcohol consuming pregnant women respective of the later mother and child into this network is an essential. It's challenge to the whole society both to enact a specific FASD-prevention law and to establish mandatory guidelines.

N2  - Background: Number processing deficits are frequently seen in children exposed to alcohol in utero. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the neural correlates of number processing in 15 right-handed, 8- to 12-year-old children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS) and 18 right-handed, age- and gender-matched controls from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, using Proximity Judgment and Exact Addition tasks. Results: Control children activated the expected fronto-parietal network during both tasks, including the anterior horizontal intraparietal sulcus (HIPS), left posterior HIPS, left precentral sulcus, and posterior medial frontal cortex. By contrast, on the Proximity Judgment task, the exposed children recruited additional parietal pathways involving the right and left angular gyrus and posterior cingulate/precuneus, which may entail verbally mediated recitation of numbers and/or subtraction to assess relative numerical distances. During Exact Addition, the exposed children exhibited more diffuse and widespread activations, including the cerebellar vermis and cortex, which have been found to be activated in adults engaged in particularly challenging number processing problems. Conclusions: The data suggest that, whereas control children rely primarily on the fronto-parietal network identified in previous studies to mediate number processing, children with FAS/PFAS recruit a broader range of brain regions to perform these relatively simple number processing tasks. Our results are consistent with structural neuroimaging findings indicating that the parietal lobe is relatively more affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and provide the first evidence for brain activation abnormalities during number processing in children with FAS/PFAS, effects that persist even after controlling statistically for group differences in total intracranial volume and IQ.

N2  - Objective To examine the association of fetal alcohol exposure during pregnancy with child and adolescent behavioural development. Design The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study recruited 2900 pregnancies (1989-91) and the 14-year follow up was conducted between 2003 and 2006. Setting Tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth, Western Australia. Population The women in the study provided data at 18 and 34 weeks of gestation on weekly alcohol intake: no drinking, occasional drinking (up to one standard drink per week), light drinking (2-6 standard drinks per week), moderate drinking (7-10 standard drinks per week), and heavy drinking (11 or more standard drinks per week). Methods Longitudinal regression models were used to analyse the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) scores over 14 years, assessed by continuous z-scores and clinical cutoff points, after adjusting for confounders. Main outcome measure Their children were followed up at ages 2, 5, 8, 10 and 14 years. The CBCL was used to measure child behaviour. Results Light drinking and moderate drinking in the first 3 months of pregnancy were associated with child CBCL z-scores indicative of positive behaviour over 14 years after adjusting for maternal and sociodemographic characteristics. These changes in z-score indicated a clinically meaningful reduction in total, internalising and externalising behavioural problems across the 14 years of follow up. Conclusions Our findings do not implicate light-moderate consumption of alcohol in pregnancy as a risk factor in the epidemiology of child behavioural problems. © RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

N2  - Aims: To study the long-term changes of dendritic spine and synapse taking place in a mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Methods: Pregnant mice were intubated daily with ethanol (EtOH) from E5 to parturition. A DiI diolistic method was used to label dendritic spines of pyramidal cells in the visual cortex of EtOH-exposed and control pups over the period from postnatal (P) day P0 to P30; synaptic ultrastructure was also analyzed using transmission electron microscopy. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with a significant decrease in the number of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex and an increase in their mean length. The changes were dose dependent and persisted to P30. Ultrastructural changes were also observed, with decreased numbers of synaptic vesicles, narrowing of the synaptic cleft and thickening of the postsynaptic density compared to controls; ultrastructural changes also persisted to P30. Conclusions: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with longterm changes in dendritic spines and synaptic ultrastructure; these alterations probably reflect the developmental retardation of dendritic spines and synapses in visual cortex. These long-term changes are likely to contribute to lifelong mental retardation associated with childhood FASDs. © The Author 2010.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can have detrimental effects on a child's development of adaptive behaviors necessary for success in the areas of academic achievement, socialization, and self-care. Sensory processing abilities have been found to affect a child's ability to successfully perform adaptive behaviors. The current study explored whether significant differences in sensory processing abilities, adaptive behavior, and neurocognitive functioning are observed between children diagnosed with partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND), or children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol (PEA), but did not meet criteria for an FASD diagnosis. The influence of IQ on adaptive behavior as well as further exploration of the relationship between sensory processing and adaptive behavior deficits among these children was also examined. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted on some of the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) scores, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System - Second Edition (ABAS-II) scores, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition/Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Third Edition (WISC- IV/WPPSI - III) scores of 46 children between 3 and 14 years of age with pFAS, ARND, or who were PEA. Results: Greater sensory processing deficits were found in children with a diagnosis of pFAS and ARND compared to those in the PEA group. Children with an ARND diagnosis scored significantly worse on measures of adaptive behavior than the PEA group. Children with pFAS scored significantly lower than children with ARND or PEA on perceptual/performance IQ. No correlation was found between IQ scores and adaptive behaviors across the FASD diagnostic categories. A significant positive correlation was found between SSP and ABAS-II scores. Conclusions: Regardless of the diagnosis received under the FASD umbrella, functional difficulties that could not be observed using traditional measures of intelligence were found, supporting guidelines that a broad range of standardized assessments be included when screening children for FASD. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are sensitive and specific biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in pregnancy. We recently reported a 2.5% rate of FAEE positive meconium in a general population sample of infants born in the region of Grey-Bruce, Ontario. Women in this region with high-risk pregnancies are transferred to a tertiary care facility in London, Ontario. The objective of this study was to determine, in a population-based sample, whether high-risk pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of in utero alcohol exposure. Grey-Bruce residents transferred to the high-risk obstetric unit of St. Joseph's Health Care in London, Ontario were identified and consented to this anonymous prevalence study. Meconium was collected and analyzed for FAEE using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. The prevalence of FAEE positive meconium was compared with the population-based prevalence in the Grey-Bruce. Fifty meconium specimens were collected from August 1, 2006 to July 31, 2007. Fifteen (30%) specimens tested positive for FAEE. The results indicate that infants born in the high-risk obstetric unit had a 12-fold higher risk of screening positive for second and third trimester alcohol exposure compared with infants born in the general population of Grey-Bruce (relative risk = 12.04, 95% confidence interval = 6.40-22.65, Pandlt; .0001). These results suggest that the high-risk pregnancies should be screened for PAE and followed-up for potential diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. andcopy; 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to a wide range of adverse effects on a developing fetus. As a whole, these teratogenic outcomes are generally known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, the most severe of which is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Clinically, children diagnosed with FAS vary greatly in their presentation of symptoms, likely due to the amount of alcohol and timing of exposure, as well as maternal and genetic influences. All these factors play a role in determining the mechanisms through which alcohol damages a developing brain, the details of which are still largely unknown. However, continuing research and recent developments have provided promising results that may lead to screening mechanisms and treatment therapies for children with FAS. Here we review the teratogenic effects of alcohol, strategies for detecting maternal alcohol consumption, identification of fetal biological markers, and prevention methods for FAS. © 2010 S.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which includes a range of developmental deficits. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most severe form of FASD and can be diagnosed with pathognomonic facial features such as a smooth philtrum, short palpebral fissure, and thin upper vermilion. However, many children with developmental damage because of prenatal alcohol exposure exhibit none, or only a subset, of the above features, making diagnosis difficult. This study explored novel analyses to quantify the effect of a known dose of alcohol on specific facial measurements in substrains C57BL/B6J (B6J) and C57BL/6NHsd (B6N) mice. Mouse dams were provided alcohol (Alc) consisting of 4.8% (vol/vol) alcohol in a liquid diet for 16 days prepregnancy and chow and water diet during mating, and then the alcohol liquid diet was reinstated on gestational days 7 (E7) to gestational day 17 (E17). Treatment controls included a pair-fed (PF) group given matched volumes of an alcohol-free liquid diet made isocalorically and a group given ad lib access to lab chow and water (Chow). Maternal diet intake (Alc and PF), blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), embryo weights, and 15 morphometric facial measurements for E17 embryos were analyzed. B6N dams drank more alcohol during pregnancy and generated higher BAC than B6J dams. Both the Alc and PF treatments induced significant reductions in embryo weights relative to Chow in both substrains. Alcohol treatments produced significant changes, relative to controls, in 4 of the 15 facial measures for the B6N substrain but only in two measures for the B6J substrain. Discriminant analysis demonstrated successful classification of the alcohol-exposed versus nonalcohol-exposed B6N embryos, with a high sensitivity of 86%, specificity 80%, and overall classification (total correct 83%), whereas B6J mice yielded sensitivity of 80%, specificity 78%, and overall correct classification in 79%. In addition, B6N mice showed significantly more effects of pair feeding on these facial measures than did B6J mice, suggesting that the B6N substrain may be more vulnerable to nutritional stress during pregnancy. Overall, these data indicate that both B6N and B6J mice were vulnerable to alcohol but show differences in the severity and location of alcohol-induced dysmorphic facial features and may parallel findings from human studies comparing different ethnic groups. Furthermore, these findings suggest that discriminant analysis may be useful in predicting alcohol exposure in either mouse substrains. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Alcohol (ethanol) consumption during pregnancy is linked to congenital heart defects that are associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent reports have associated ethanol exposure with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Therefore, we defined whether ethanol affects Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during cardiac cell specification. Study Design: Pregnant mice on embryonic day 6.75 during gastrulation were exposed by an intraperitoneal injection to a binge-drinking dose of ethanol. Folic acid supplementation of mouse diet was tested for the prevention of ethanol-induced cardiac birth defects. Results: Acute ethanol exposure induced myocardial wall changes and atrioventricular and semilunar valve defects, which was determined by echocardiography on embryonic day 15.5. A high folate diet prevented the ethanol-induced cardiac defects. Ethanol exposure in avian embryos suppressed 2 key Wnt-modulated genes that are involved in cardiac induction; folic acid rescued normal gene expression. Conclusion: Folic acid supplementation alone or with myoinositol prevented alcohol potentiation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that allowed normal gene activation and cardiogenesis. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - The main objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of meconium analysis for fatty acid ethyl esters as a universal screening tool intended for the detection of newborns at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This will be accomplished by assessing the rate of voluntary participation in a nonanonymous neonatal screening program and by determining the logistics of implementing the necessary follow-up and interventions as part of routine care. Additionally, this study will determine the predictive value of fatty acid ethyl ester-positive meconium with regard to neurodevelopmental delays. This is an ongoing prospective cohort study. Written informed consent is sought from all Grey Bruce women delivering at participating birthing sites. Collected meconium samples are tested for fatty acid ethyl esters by headspace-solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Children with positive results are followed up through an existing public health program involving regular home visits and assessments of developmental milestones by a public health nurse. These children and matched control subjects also undergo neurodevelopmental testing at 3 and 18 months of age by a clinical psychologist using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. If delays are detected, the child is referred to diagnostic services and appropriate intervention programs. This study has been granted ethics approval and enrollment began in November 2008 at St. Joseph Health Care in London, Ontario. The first positive case has been identified and the follow-up is currently being conducted by the public health unit. The successful completing of this study will reveal the population's willingness to participate in a neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure and determine the costs, feasibility, and utility of implementing such programs in clinical practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether treatment with neuroprotective peptides to young adult mice prenatally exposed to alcohol reverses alcohol-induced learning deficits in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the mechanism involves the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and -aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, and whether it is related to glial cells. METHODS: C57Bl6/J mice were treated with alcohol (0.03 ml/g) or placebo on gestational day 8. On day 40, male mice exposed to alcohol in utero were treated daily for 10 days with D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA (n=20) or placebo (n=13); and control offspring were treated with placebo (n=46), with the treatment blinded. Learning evaluation began after 3 days using the Morris watermaze and the T-maze. The hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum were isolated. Expression of NR2A, NR2B, GABAAbeta3, GABAAalpha5, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, and glial fibrillary acidic protein was measured using calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher's protected least significant difference. Results: Treatment with D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA reversed the alcohol-induced learning deficit in both learning tests as well as the NR2A and NR2B down-regulation in the hippocampus and the up-regulation of NR2A in the cortex and NR2B in the cortex and cerebellum (all P<.05). No significant differences were found in GABAA expression. Moreover, the peptides changed activity-dependent neuroprotective protein expression in the cortex (P=.016) but not the down-regulation of VIP (P=.883), probably because the peptides are downstream from VIP. Conclusion: Alcohol-induced learning deficit was reversed and expression of NR2A and NR2B was restored in the hippocampus and cortex of young adult mice treated with D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA. Given the role of NMDA receptors in learning, this may explain in part the mechanism of prevention of alcohol-induced learning deficits by D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA. © 2010 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a challenging public health problem. Previous studies have found an association between FASD and oxidative stress. In the present study, we assessed the role of oxidative stress in ethanol-induced embryonic damage and the effect of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a powerful antioxidant extracted from green tea, on the development of FASD in a murine model.Methods: Pregnant female mice were given intraperitoneal ethanol (25%, 0.005 to 0.02 ml/g) on gestational day 8 (G8) to establish the FASD model. On G10.25, mice were sacrificed and embryos were collected and photographed to determine head length (HL), head width (HW), and crown rump length (CRL). For mice given EGCG, administration was through a feeding tube on G7 and G8 (dose: 200, 300, or 400 mg/kg/d, the total amount for a day was divided into 2 equal portions). G10.25 embryos were evaluated morphologically. Brain tissues of G9.25 embryos were used for RT-PCR and western blotting of neural marker genes and proteins and detection of oxidative stress indicators.Results: Administration of ethanol to pregnant mice on G8 led to the retardation of embryonic growth and down-regulation of neural marker genes. In addition, administration of ethanol (0.02 ml/g) led to the elevation of oxidative stress indicators [hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA)]. Administration of EGCG on G7 and G8 along with ethanol on G8 ameliorated the ethanol-induced growth retardation. Mice given EGCG (400 mg/kg/d) along with ethanol had embryo sizes and neural marker genes expression similar to the normal controls. Furthermore, EGCG (400 mg/kg on G7 and G8) inhibited the increase in H2O2 and MDA.Conclusions: In a murine model, oxidative stress appears to play an important role in ethanol-induced embryonic growth retardation. EGCG can prevent some of the embryonic injuries caused by ethanol. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Altered fetal programming because of a suboptimal in utero environment has been shown to increase susceptibility to many diseases later in life. This study examined the effect of alcohol exposure in utero on N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU)-induced mammary cancer risk during adulthood.Methods: Study 1: Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were fed a liquid diet containing 6.7% ethanol (alcohol-fed), an isocaloric liquid diet (pair-fed), or rat chow ad libitum (ad lib-fed) from day 11 to 21 of gestation. At birth, female pups were cross-fostered to ad lib-fed control dams. Adult offspring were given an I.P. injection of NMU at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Mammary glands were palpated for tumors twice a week, and rats were euthanized at 23 weeks postinjection. Study 2: To investigate the role of estradiol (E2), animals were exposed to the same in utero treatments but were not given NMU. Serum was collected during the preovulatory phase of the estrous cycle.Results: At 16 weeks postinjection, overall tumor multiplicity was greater in the offspring from the alcohol-fed group compared to the control groups, indicating a decrease in tumor latency. At study termination, 70% of all animals possessed tumors. Alcohol-exposed animals developed more malignant tumors and more estrogen receptor-alpha-negative tumors relative to the control groups. In addition, IGF-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) mRNA and protein were decreased in tumors of alcohol-exposed animals. Study 2 showed that alcohol-fed animals had significantly increased circulating E2 when compared to either control group.Conclusions: These data indicate that alcohol exposure in utero increases susceptibility to mammary tumorigenesis in adulthood and suggest that alterations in the IGF and E2 systems may play a role in the underlying mechanism. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Although the structural phenotype of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is established, prenatal exposure to alcohol may produce a broader spectrum of defects, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Documenting the full spectrum of defects associated with FASD is critical to determining the true incidence of this disorder. We examined 831 children from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders using a structured protocol for diagnosis of FAS using the cardinal facial and growth features, and assessment of additional structural defects thought to occur more often in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects were classified as FAS, Deferred (some characteristic features of FAS), or No FAS, Groups were compared on prevalence of additional features and number of additional features observed, stratified by diagnostic category, sex, race, and age. Prevalence of most additional features was greatest among subjects with FAS and least among No FAS. A higher frequency of additional features was observed among FAS and Deferred subjects >12 years of age than among those under 12. FAS and Deferred Whites had greater frequency of additional features than Cape Colored. Prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broad spectrum of structural defects that goes beyond FAS with implications regarding the impact of alcohol on the developing fetus, a prerequisite for ultimate prevention of FASD. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Infant symbolic play was examined in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure and socioenvironmental background and to predict which infants met criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) at 5 years. A total of 107 Cape-Colored, South African infants born to heavy drinking mothers and abstainers/light drinkers were recruited prenatally. Complexity of play, sociodemographic and psychological correlates of maternal alcohol use, and quality of parenting were assessed at 13 months, and intelligence quotient and FAS diagnosis at 5 years. The effect of drinking on spontaneous play was not significant after control for social environment. In contrast, prenatal alcohol and quality of parenting related independently to elicited play. Elicited play predicted 5-year Digit Span and was poorer in infants subsequently diagnosed with FAS/partial FAS and in nonsyndromal heavily exposed infants, compared with abstainers/light drinkers. Thus, symbolic play may provide an early indicator of risk for alcohol-related deficits. The independent effects of prenatal alcohol and quality of parenting suggest that infants whose symbolic play is adversely affected by alcohol exposure may benefit from stimulation from a responsive caregiver.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinical manifestations of FASD are highly variable and include mental retardation and developmental defects of the heart, kidney, muscle, skeleton, and craniofacial structures. Specific effects of ethanol on fetal cells include induction of apoptosis as well as inhibition of proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This complex set of responses suggests that a bioinformatics approach could clarify some of the pathways involved in these responses. Methods: In this study, the responses of fetal stem cells derived from the amniotic fluid (AFSCs) to treatment with ethanol have been examined. Large-scale transcriptome analysis of ethanol-treated AFSCs indicates that genes involved in skeletal development and ossification are up-regulated in these cells. Therefore, the effect of ethanol on osteogenic differentiation of AFSCs was studied. Results: Exposure to ethanol during the first 48 hours of an osteogenic differentiation protocol increased in vitro calcium deposition by AFSCs and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. In contrast, ethanol treatment later in the differentiation protocol (day 8) had no significant effect on the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Conclusions: These results suggest that transient exposure of AFSCs to ethanol during early differentiation enhances osteogenic differentiation of the cells.

N2  - Objective: Our objective was to evaluate whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and whether the neuroprotective effects of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-related peptides, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), are mediated through BDNF. Study Design: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40. Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization. Results: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P < .05). Pretreatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P < .05) at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P > .05). Conclusion: NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this investigation were to determine the frequencies of and associations between different neurodevelopmental disorders and to study the potential lasting effects of alcohol on children adopted from eastern Europe. METHODS: In a population-based, prospective, observational, multidisciplinary, cross-sectional, cohort study of 71 children adopted from eastern Europe, children were assessed 5 years after adoption, from pediatric, neuropsychological, and ophthalmologic perspectives. RESULTS: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, that is, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, were identified for 52% of children; FAS was found for 30%, partial FAS for 14%, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders for 9%. Alcohol-related birth defects were found for 11% of children, all of whom also were diagnosed as having FAS. Mental retardation or significant cognitive impairment was found for 23% of children, autism for 9%, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder for 51%, and developmental coordination disorder for 34%. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders were common in this long-term follow-up study of children adopted from orphanages in eastern Europe. Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has long-lasting adverse effects, causing structural, behavioral, and cognitive damage despite a radically improved environment.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Human malformations caused by alcohol consumption in pregnancy have been recognized as the fetal alcohol syndrome for almost 40 years. Prenatal exposure to ethanol is now established as causing permanent brain alterations leading to lifetime adaptive disability. Prevention approaches have not yet yielded a coherent approach to reducing harm from prenatal alcohol exposure. An important component of the Canada Northwest Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Research Network is to develop and assess research that can inform public policy. FASD prevention is a targeted goal. The Networks strategic plan for improving FASD prevention efforts has been implemented, and our progress, to date, in developing a coherent approach involves a social interventions approach, which includes: first, provision of information that might effect individual change; second, direct interactions with women deemed to be at high risk for having children with FASD; third, placement of FASD-prevention programs into a social determinant of health context; and fourth, incorporation of concepts for FASD prevention into other types of intervention programs for women who might also be at high risk for having children with FASD. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.

N2  - Background: Neurocognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in adulthood are not well documented. Questions persist regarding the extent to which there are specific, measurable effects beyond those associated with global ability deficits, whether individuals without the full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) demonstrate alcohol-related cognitive impairments, and whether observed memory effects are specific to a particular modality, i.e., verbal vs. visual/spatial domains. Methods: In this study, verbal and nonverbal selective reminding paradigms were used to assess memory function in 234 young adults (M age: 22.78, SD: 1.79). Alcohol exposure was quantified prenatally. Alcohol groups included: Individuals with physical effects of alcohol exposure (Dysmorphic group, n = 47); Exposed individuals without such effects (n = 74). Contrast groups included: Controls (n = 59) matched for ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and hospital of birth; Special Education contrast group (n = 54) included to control for disability status. Memory outcomes entailed total recall, delayed recall, and measures of encoding and retrieval, and learning over trials as indexed by slope. Results: Results indicated that Dysmorphic individuals were significantly less efficient in memory performance than Controls on all of the outcomes measured, but they did not differ from those in the Special Education contrast group. The nondysmorphic, alcohol-exposed group was intermediate in their performance, suggesting a continuum of effects of prenatal exposure. Evaluation of the encoding and retrieval aspects of memory performance indicated that learning rather than forgetting accounted for the deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Finally, no interaction was found between modality of presentation (verbal and nonverbal) and effects of alcohol exposure on memory performance. Conclusion: These findings indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with persistent and specific effects on memory performance, and these problems result from less efficient encoding of information across both verbal and nonverbal modalities. Education and training efforts with this clinical group should take these characteristics into account. Copyright © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - There is increasing evidence that human pregnancy outcome can be significantly compromised by suboptimal maternal nutritional status. Poor diet results in a maternal-fetal environment in which the teratogenicity of other insults such as alcohol might be amplified. As an example, there is evidence that zinc (Zn) can interact with maternal alcohol exposure to influence the risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Studies with experimental animals have shown that the teratogenicity of alcohol is increased under conditions of Zn deficiency, whereas its teratogenicity is lessened when animals are given Zn-supplemented diets or Zn injections before the alcohol exposure. Alcohol can precipitate an acute-phase response, resulting in a subsequent increase in maternal liver metallothionein, which can sequester Zn and lead to decreased Zn transfer to the fetus. Importantly, the teratogenicity of acute alcohol exposure is reduced in metallothionein knockout mice, which can have improved Zn transfer to the conceptus relative to wild-type mice. Consistent with the above, Zn status has been reported to be low in alcoholic women at delivery. Preliminary data from two basic science and clinical nutritional studies that are ongoing as part of the international Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders support the potential role of Zn, among other nutritional factors, relative to risk for FASD. Importantly, the nutrient levels being examined in these studies are relevant to general clinical populations and represent suboptimal levels rather than severe deficiencies. These data suggest that moderate deficiencies in single nutrients can act as permissive factors for FASD, and that adequate nutritional status or intervention through supplementation may provide protection from some of the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2010 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is associated with numerous neurobehavioral alterations, as well as disabilities in a number of domains, including a high incidence of depression and anxiety disorders. Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) also alters hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function, resulting in increased responsiveness to stressors and HPA dysregulation in adulthood. Interestingly, data suggest that pre-existing HPA abnormalities may be a major contributory factor to some forms of depression, particularly when an individual is exposed to stressors later in life. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to stressors in adulthood may unmask an increased vulnerability to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in PAE animals. Methods: Male and female offspring from prenatal alcohol (PAE), pair-fed (PF), and ad libitum-fed control (C) treatment groups were tested in adulthood. Animals were exposed to 10 consecutive days of chronic mild stress (CMS), and assessed in a battery of well-validated tasks sensitive to differences in depressive- and/or anxiety-like behaviors. Results: We report here that the combination of PAE and CMS in adulthood increases depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in a sexually dimorphic manner. PAE males showed impaired hedonic responsivity (sucrose contrast test), locomotor hyperactivity (open field), and alterations in affiliative and nonaffiliative social behaviors (social interaction test) compared to control males. By contrast, PAE and, to a lesser extent, PF, females showed greater levels of "behavioral despair" in the forced swim test, and PAE females showed altered behavior in the final 5 minutes of the social interaction test compared to control females. Conclusions: These data support the possibility that stress may be a mediating or contributing factor in the psychopathologies reported in FASD populations. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Ethanol acutely inhibits ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated responses and long-term potentiation in the developing CA1 hippocampus
A1  - Puglia M.P.
A1  - Valenzuela C.F.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Developmental ethanol (EtOH) exposure damages the hippocampus, causing long-lasting alterations in learning and memory. Alterations in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity may play a role in the mechanism of action of EtOH. This signaling is fundamental for synaptogenesis, which occurs during the third trimester of human pregnancy (first 12 days of life in rats). Methods: Acute coronal brain slices were prepared from 7- to 9-day-old rats. Extracellular and patch-clamp electrophysiological recording techniques were used to characterize the acute effects of EtOH on alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor (AMPAR)- and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 hippocampal region. Results: Ethanol (40 and 80 mM) inhibited AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). EtOH (80 mM) also reduced AMPAR-mediated fEPSPs in the presence of an inhibitor of Ca2+ permeable AMPARs. The effect of 80 mM EtOH on NMDAR-mediated fEPSPs was significantly greater in the presence of Mg 2+. EtOH (80 mM) neither affected the paired-pulse ratio of AMPAR-mediated fEPSPs nor the presynaptic volley. The paired-pulse ratio of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents was not affected either, and the amplitude of these currents was inhibited to a lesser extent than that of fEPSPs. EtOH (80 mM) inhibited LTP of AMPAR-mediated fEPSPs. Conclusions: Acute EtOH exposure during the third-trimester equivalent of human pregnancy inhibits hippocampal glutamatergic transmission and LTP induction, which could alter synapse refinement and ultimately contribute to the pathophysiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibition does not restore ocular dominance plasticity in a ferret model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
A1  - Krahe T.E.

A1  - Medina A.E.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: There is growing evidence that deficits in neuronal plasticity account for some of the neurological problems observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Recently, we showed that early alcohol exposure results in a permanent impairment in visual cortex ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in a ferret model of FASD. This disruption can be reversed, however, by treating animals with a Phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 1 inhibitor long after the period of alcohol exposure. Aim: Because the mammalian brain presents different types of PDE isoforms we tested here whether inhibition of PDE type 4 also ameliorates the effects of alcohol on OD plasticity. Material and Methods: Ferrets received 3.5 g/Kg alcohol i.p. (25% in saline) or saline as control every other day between postnatal day (P) 10 to P30, which is roughly equivalent to the third trimester equivalent of human gestation. Following a prolonged alcohol-free period (10 to 15 days), ferrets had the lid of the right eye sutured closed for 4 days and were examined for ocular dominance changes at the end of the period of deprivation. Results: Using in vivo electrophysiology we show that inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram does not restore OD plasticity in alcohol-treated ferrets. Conclusion: This result suggests that contrary to PDE1, PDE4 inhibition does not play a role in the restoration of OD plasticity in the ferret model of FASD. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine exposure to alcohol may result in a distinct pattern of craniofacial abnormalities and central nervous system dysfunction, designated fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The spectrum of malformations of the brain associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy is much broader than the relatively uniform clinical phenotype of FAS. Among these malformations the most striking abnormalities involve the impairment of neuronal cell migration. However, polymicrogyria (PMG) has so far been reported only once in a human autopsy study of a child with FAS. CASE: A 16-year-old girl with confirmed maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and full phenotype of FAS presented after two generalized epileptic seizures for neurologic assessment. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral PMG in the superior frontal gyrus with asymmetric distribution. History, clinical features, and genetic investigations provided no evidence for any of the known genetic or acquired causes of PMG. Therefore, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of PMG in this patient rather than a mere coincidence. CONCLUSION: Our observation represents only the second patient of PMG in FAS and confirms the phenotypic variability of cerebral malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In patients with clinical features of FAS and neurologic deficits or seizures neuroimaging is recommended. Furthermore, FAS should be considered as a differential diagnosis for PMG. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) often demonstrate a variety of cognitive deficits, but mathematical ability seems to be particularly affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Parietal brain regions have been implicated in both functional and structural studies of mathematical ability in healthy individuals, but little is known about the brain structure underlying mathematical deficits in children with FASD. The goal of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the relationship between mathematical skill and brain white matter structure in children with FASD. Methods: Twenty-one children aged 5 to 13 years diagnosed with FASD underwent DTI on a 1.5-T MRI scanner and cognitive assessments including the Woodcock-Johnson Quantitative Concepts test. Voxel-based analysis was conducted by normalizing subject images to a template and correlating fractional anisotropy (FA) values across the brain white matter with age-standardized math scores. Results: Voxel-based analysis revealed 4 clusters with significant correlations between FA and math scores: 2 positively-correlated clusters in the left parietal region, 1 positively-correlated cluster in the left cerebellum, and 1 negatively-correlated cluster in the bilateral brainstem. Diffusion tractography identified the specific white matter tracts passing through these clusters, namely the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, left corticospinal tract and body of the corpus callosum, middle cerebellar peduncle, and bilateral projection fibers including the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule. Conclusions: These results identify 4 key regions related to mathematical ability and provide a link between brain microstructure and cognitive skills in children with FASD. Given previous findings in typically developing children and those with other abnormal conditions, our results highlight the consistent importance of the left parietal area for mathematical tasks across various populations, and also demonstrate other regions that may be specific to mathematical processing in children with FASD. © 2009 Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The study sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of being at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) among women of child-bearing age in an urban and rural location in South Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional household survey of 1018 women aged 18-44 years in one urban (n = 606) and one rural (n = 412) site. The women were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. We defined the primary dependent variable, being at risk of having an AEP, as current alcohol use, not being pregnant, being fertile, and no effective use of contraceptives. The independent variables included demographic, substance use, health perceptions, psycho-social, and partner characteristics. The rural women (21.84%) were more likely than their urban counterparts (11.22%) to be at risk of an AEP. In multiple logistic regression analyses, significant predictors of being in the "at risk" group for the urban women were (a) being 'white' as opposed to 'black/African', and being 'coloured' as opposed to 'black/African'; and (b) current smoking. For the rural women, significant risk factors were (a) current smoking and (b) early onset of alcohol use. The significant protective factors were (a) education; (b) knowledge about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; (c) parity. Use of stricter alcohol use criteria (i.e., three or more drinks and five or more drinks per sitting) in the definition of risk of an AEP yielded slightly different patterns of significant predictors. The results revealed high levels of risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, especially amongst the rural women, and a need for location-specific prevention programmes. The high burden of AEP in South Africa calls for the establishment of national AEP prevention strategies and programmes as a matter of urgency. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: This magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM)-based report is the second in a series designed to illustrate the spectrum of craniofacial and central nervous system (CNS) dysmorphia resulting from single- and multiple-day maternal ethanol treatment. The study described in this report examined the consequences of ethanol exposure on gestational day (GD) 7 in mice, a time in development when gastrulation and neural plate development begins; corresponding to the mid- to late third week postfertilization in humans. Acute GD 7 ethanol exposure in mice has previously been shown to result in CNS defects consistent with holoprosencephaly (HPE) and craniofacial anomalies typical of those in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). MRM has facilitated further definition of the range of GD 7 ethanol-induced defects. Methods: C57Bl/6J female mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered vehicle or 2 injections of 2.9 g/kg ethanol on day 7 of pregnancy. Stage-matched control and ethanol-exposed GD 17 fetuses selected for imaging were immersion fixed in a Bouins/Prohance solution. MRM was conducted at either 7.0 Tesla (T) or 9.4 T. Resulting 29 mum isotropic spatial resolution scans were segmented and reconstructed to provide 3D images. Linear and volumetric brain measures, as well as morphological features, were compared for control and ethanol-exposed fetuses. Following MRM, selected specimens were processed for routine histology and light microscopic examination. Results: Gestational day 7 ethanol exposure resulted in a spectrum of median facial and forebrain deficiencies, as expected. This range of abnormalities falls within the HPE spectrum; a spectrum for which facial dysmorphology is consistent with and typically is predictive of that of the forebrain. In addition, other defects including median facial cleft, cleft palate, micrognathia, pituitary agenesis, and third ventricular dilatation were identified. MRM analyses also revealed cerebral cortical dysplasia/heterotopias resulting from this acute, early insult and facilitated a subsequent focused histological investigation of these defects. Conclusions: Individual MRM scans and 3D reconstructions of fetal mouse brains have facilitated demonstration of a broad range of GD 7 ethanol-induced morphological abnormality. These results, including the discovery of cerebral cortical heterotopias, elucidate the teratogenic potential of ethanol insult during the third week of human prenatal development. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters adult neurogenesis and the neurogenic response to stress in male rats. As the effects of stress on neurogenesis are sexually dimorphic, the present study investigated the effects of PAE on adult hippocampal neurogenesis under both nonstressed and stressed conditions in female rats. Pregnant females were assigned to one of three prenatal treatments: (1) alcohol (PAE)-liquid alcohol (ethanol) diet ad libitum (36% ethanol-derived calories); (2) pair-fed-isocaloric liquid diet, with maltose-dextrin substituted for ethanol, in the amount consumed by a PAE partner (g/kg body wt/day of gestation); and (3) control-lab chow ad libitum. Female offspring were assigned to either nonstressed (undisturbed) or stressed (repeated restraint stress for 9 days) conditions. On day 10, all rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and perfused either 24 hours (cell proliferation) or 3 weeks (cell survival) later. We found that PAE did not significantly alter cell proliferation or survival, whereas females from the pair-fed condition exhibited elevated levels of cell survival compared to control females. Importantly, however, the proportion of both new neurons and new glial cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was reduced in PAE compared to control females. Exposure to stress did not alter neurogenesis in any of the prenatal treatment groups. In summary, compared to females from the control condition, prenatal dietary restriction enhanced the survival of new neurons, whereas PAE altered the differentiation of newly produced cells in the adult dentate gyrus. Alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis following PAE may contribute to learning and memory deficits seen in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common nongenetic cause of mental retardation and is characterized by neurodevelopmental anomalies. C-fos is a cellular marker of transcriptional activity in the stress-signal pathway. Previously, we showed the treatment with NAP (NAPVSIPQ)+SAL (SALLRSIPA) reversed the learning deficit after prenatal alcohol exposure in FAS. Our objective was to evaluate if the mechanism of actions of NAP+SAL involves the stress-signal pathway differentiating c-fos expression in mouse brains after prenatal alcohol exposure. C57Bl6/J mice were treated with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or placebo on gestational day 8. On postnatal day 40, in utero alcohol-exposed males were treated via gavage with 40 mug D-NAP and 40 mug D-SAL (n=6) or placebo (n=4); controls were gavaged with placebo daily (n=12). After learning evaluation, hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex were isolated. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were performed. Statistics included analysis of variance and post hoc Fisher analysis. Adult treatment with NAP+SAL restored the down-regulation of c-fos in the hippocampus after prenatal alcohol exposure (p<0.05), but not in the cerebellum. There was no difference in c-fos expression in the cortex. Adult treatment with NAP+SAL restored the down-regulation of c-fos expression in hippocampus attenuating the alcohol-induced alteration of the stress-signal pathway.

N2  - The present experiment assessed motor response programming and movement time in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PEA). Alcohol-exposed children between the ages of 7 and 17 years were classified into two groups: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS: n=9) and children with PEA (PEA: n=19) but who did not have the defining characteristics of FAS. The FAS and PEA children were compared with non-alcohol-exposed children (NC: n=23) when completing two tasks: a simple reaction time task (RT alone condition) and a reaction plus movement task (RT. +. Move condition). The movement involved responding to an imperative stimulus signal and depressing three target buttons in a set sequence. Participants completed 24 trials each for the RT alone and RT. +. Move response conditions. Results indicated no significant differences in performance among FAS, PEA, and NC groups during the RT alone condition. However, during the RT. +. Move condition, the FAS group produced significantly longer and more variable RTs than the PEA and NC groups, which produced comparable RTs. The FAS group also produced significantly slower movement times when moving to all three targets, whereas movement time variability did not significantly differ as a function of group. The observed results indicate children with FAS experience deficits in response programming and movement time production. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - We previously demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure results in brain defects at different embryonic stages. This study is aimed at characterizing the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure on the levels of several neurotransmitters at early embryonic stage 13 (E13). Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to either a 25% ethanol derived calorie diet (ALC) or pair-fed (PF) liquid diet from E7 to E13. At E13, fetal brains were collected from dams of the ALC and PF groups. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was then used to evaluate neurotransmitter levels. This approach involved the use of an LC column in conjunction with multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Quantitative analyses of catecholamines, idolamine, and amino acid neurotransmitters revealed significant reductions in the levels of dopamine (p=0.004), norepinephrine (p=0.0009), epinephrine (p=0.0002), serotonin (p=0.004), and GABA (p=0.002) in the ALC group compared to the PF group. However, there was no significant change in the levels of glutamate in E13 fetal brains. These findings demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure reduces the concentrations of some catecholamines, idolamine, and amino acid neurotransmitters in E13 fetal brains. This study suggests that alterations of selective neurotransmitters may be the cause of abnormalities in brain function and behavior found in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2010 ISDN.

N2  - Directional asymmetry, the systematic differences between the left and right body sides, is widespread in human populations. Changes in directional asymmetry are associated with various disorders that affect craniofacial development. Because facial dysmorphology is a key criterion for diagnosing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the question arises whether in utero alcohol exposure alters directional asymmetry in the face. Data on the relative position of 17 morphologic landmarks were obtained from facial scans of children who were classified as either FAS or control. Shape data obtained from the landmarks were analyzed with the methods of geometric morphometrics. Our analyses showed significant directional asymmetry of facial shape, consisting primarily of a shift of midline landmarks to the right and a displacement of the landmarks around the eyes to the left. The asymmetry of FAS and control groups differed significantly and average directional asymmetry was increased in those individuals exposed to alcohol in utero. These results suggest that the developmental consequences of fetal alcohol exposure affect a wide range of craniofacial features in addition to those generally recognized and used for diagnosis of FAS. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading preventable causes of developmental disabilities with serious permanent consequences. Regardless of the increased awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 13% of women in the United States drink alcohol during pregnancy. Health care professionals do not routinely assess the frequency and quantity of alcohol use by their patients. This study examined the knowledge, skills, and practices of family medicine residency and clerkship directors and assessed the time devoted and format of FAS curricula in the programs. A self-administered anonymous survey was sent to the residency and clerkship directors (N=571). Response rate of clerkship directors was 52% and residency directors 46%. Both groups showed high level of knowledge of FASD and of alcohol counseling practices for pregnant women. Although almost two thirds of the residency programs had FASD integrated in the curriculum, an equivalent fraction of predoctoral programs did not. More than half of the clerkship directors without FASD in their curriculum agreed that a need exists for its inclusion. These findings raise important medical education and policy issues and provide insight into the disparity in FASD content of curricula between predoctoral and family medicine residency programs in the United States. The role of physician counseling in primary prevention of FAS should continue to be stressed in predoctoral and residency education. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Many children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy cannot be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We conducted a preliminary investigation to determine whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene expression may have some utility as a diagnostic indicator of maternal drinking during pregnancy and as a prognostic indicator of risk for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in affected offspring. Pregnant Long-Evans rats voluntarily consumed either a 0 or 5% ethanol solution 4 h each day throughout gestation. Ethanol consumption produced a mean maternal daily intermittent peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. Placentas were harvested on gestational day 20 for gene expression studies. Microarray analysis of more than 28,000 genes revealed that the expression of 304 known genes was altered twofold or greater in placenta from ethanol-consuming dams compared with controls. About 76% of these genes were repressed in ethanol-exposed placentas. Gene expression changes involved proteins associated with central nervous system development; organ morphogenesis; immunological responses; endocrine function; ion homeostasis; and skeletal, cardiovascular, and cartilage development. To date, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis has confirmed significant alterations in gene expression for 22 genes, including genes encoding for three calcium binding proteins, two matrix metalloproteinases, the cannabinoid 1, galanin 2 and toll-like receptor 4, iodothyronine deiodinase 2, 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, placental growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, gremlin 1, and epithelial growth factor (EGF)-containing extracellular matrix protein. These results suggest that the expression of a sufficiently large number of placental mRNAs is altered after moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of the placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD. Furthermore, these results provide new insights into novel mechanisms on how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate its teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function during pregnancy. © 2010.

N2  - Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) requires detection of in-pregnancy maternal risk drinking. The widely used T-ACE screen has been applied in various ways, although the impact of those different uses on effectiveness is uncertain. We examined relations among different T-ACE scoring criteria, maternal drinking, and child outcome. Self-reported across-pregnancy maternal drinking was assessed in 75 African-American women. The different T-ACE criteria used varied the level of drinking that defined tolerance (two or three drinks) and the total T-ACE score cut-points (two or three). Receiver operator curves and regression analysis assessed the significance of relations. Increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point to 3 almost doubled specificity in detecting risk drinking whereas maintaining adequate sensitivity, equivalent to that in the original report, and identified substantially more neurobehavioral deficits in children. Redefining tolerance at three drinks did not improve T-ACE effectiveness in predicting outcomes. This study is among the first to show the ability of an in-pregnancy T-ACE assessment to predict child neurodevelopmental outcome. In addition, increasing the total T-ACE score criterion (from 2 to 3) improved identification of non-drinking mothers and unaffected children with little loss in detection of drinkers and affected children. Efficient in-pregnancy screens for risk drinking afford greater opportunities for intervention that could prevent/limit FASDs. andcopy; 2010.

N2  - Detecting patterns of maternal drinking that place fetuses at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is critical to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention but is challenging because information on antenatal drinking collected during pregnancy is often insufficient or lacking. Although retrospective assessments have been considered less favored by many researchers due to presumed poor reliability, this perception may be inaccurate because of reduced maternal denial and/or distortion. The present study hypothesized that fetal alcohol exposure, as assessed retrospectively during child adolescence, would be related significantly to prior measures of maternal drinking and would predict alcohol-related behavioral problems in teens better than antenatal measures of maternal alcohol consumption. Drinking was assessed during pregnancy, and retrospectively about the same pregnancy, at a 14-year follow-up in 288 African-American women using well-validated semistructured interviews. Regression analysis examined the predictive validity of both drinking assessments on pregnancy outcomes and on teacher-reported teen behavior outcomes. Retrospective maternal self-reported drinking assessed 14 years postpartum was significantly higher than antenatal reports of consumption. Retrospective report identified 10.8 times more women as risk drinkers (andge; one drink per day) than the antenatal report. Antenatal and retrospective reports were moderately correlated and both were correlated with the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy based on retrospective report identified significantly more teens exposed prenatally to at-risk alcohol levels than antenatal, in-pregnancy reports. Retrospective report predicted more teen behavior problems (e.g., attention problems and externalizing behaviors) than the antenatal report. Antenatal report predicted younger gestational age at birth and retrospective report predicted smaller birth size; neither predicted teen IQ. These results suggest that if only antenatal, in-pregnancy maternal report is used, then a substantial proportion of children exposed prenatally to risk levels of alcohol might be misclassified. The validity of retrospective assessment of prior drinking during pregnancy as a more effective indicator of prenatal exposure was established by predicting more behavioral problems in teens than antenatal report. Retrospective report can provide valid information about drinking during a prior pregnancy and may facilitate diagnosis and subsequent interventions by educators, social service personnel, and health-care providers, thereby reducing the life-long impact of FASDs. andcopy; 2010 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Can prenatal screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder be justified? A commentary
A1  - Mizejewski G.J.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading cause of non-genetic mental retardation in the USA, possibly exceeding even Down syndrome, which is currently approaching 1 in 500 live births. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in brain, craniofacial and heart defects, neurotoxicity, and immune dysfunction. The preferred action taken to prevent alcohol consumption during pregnancy is abstinence. However, the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD remain a major public health need in this country and throughout the world. The biochemical molecules involved in the developmental anomalities encompass a vast array of signal transduction and synaptic pathways which involve neurotransmitters and neurotrophic peptides. Recent advances in medicine-based therapies for FASD have been reported, and include the use of small molecule agonists, antagonists, and competitive inhibitors. Since biomarkers for FASD have previously been identified in clinical research reports, multicenter screening feasibility studies now seem warranted and could be initiated following adequate funding, protocols, procedures, and institutional review board approvals. © 2009 S.

N2  - This ongoing collaborative study investigates the nutrient and oxidative stress status of alcohol-exposed Ukrainian pregnant women and whether micronutrient supplementation with and without choline, a nutrient critical for brain development, will reduce Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in the offspring. Analysis to date of maternal baseline plasma samples shows that alcohol-exposed women (N=49) had lower Zn and Cu concentrations, and Total Radical-trapping Antioxidant Potential (TRAP) vs. controls (N=40). There were no differences in Fe, ferritin, Mg, Ca, or ceruloplasmin activity. Methyl-donor nutrients (choline, betaine, DMG, folate, Vit B12, and homocysteine), Vit A, E and select carotenoids, and oxidative stress (TBARS, protein carbonyls) and inflammation (hsCRP) indices were similar. Absolute oz. of alcohol/drinking day during the 2 wks prior to interview was associated with higher Vit A and ferritin, and lower Vit B12. The low Zn, Cu and Vit B12 in ethanol-exposed women may contribute to adverse fetal development. It has been reported that alcohol increases body Fe stores, which can lead to oxidative stress. In our study, alcohol intake was associated with increased ferritin in pregnant women, which, when coupled with lower TRAP, may increase oxidative stress-induced teratogenesis. These data will be updated as sample size requirements are met.

N2  - Purpose: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) include growth deficiency, birth defects, and neurobehavioral impairment, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100 live births. An ongoing study investigates whether nutritional inadequacies of alcohol-exposed Ukrainian pregnant women amplify alcohol teratogenicity, and whether micronutrient supplementation with and without choline, a nutrient critical for brain development, will reduce FASD in the offspring. Methods: As part of an international collaborative study on FASD, pregnant women in Ukraine who report moderate to heavy alcohol use in early pregnancy, or no or low amounts of alcohol (controls), are prospectively recruited. Women are then randomly assigned to receive micronutrient supplementation, with and without choline, or no supplementation. At enrollment, and at 32 weeks gestation, blood is collected and analyzed for vitamin, mineral and oxidative stress status. Results: Analysis to date of maternal baseline (gestational age: 20.6 +/- 0.7 weeks) plasma samples shows that alcohol-exposed women (n = 49) had lower Zn and Cu concentrations, and Total Radical-trapping Antioxidant Potential (TRAP) than controls (n = 40). Concentrations of iron, ferritin, magnesium and calcium, and ceruloplasmin activity were similar between groups. There was no difference in concentrations of methyl-donor nutrients (choline, betaine, DMG, folate, Vitamin B12, and homocysteine), or Vitamins A, E and select carotenoids. Indices of oxidative stress (TBARS, protein carbonyls) and inflammation (hsCRP) were also similar. Absolute oz. of alcohol/drinking day during the 2 weeks prior to interview was associated with higher Vitamin A and ferritin, and lower Vitamin B12. Conclusion: Low Vitamin B12 status in ethanol-exposed women may contribute to adverse fetal development. It has been reported that alcohol increases body Fe stores, which can lead to oxidative stress. In our study, alcohol intake was associated with increased ferritin. This, coupled with the compromised Zn and Cu status, and the lower antioxidant capacity of the blood (TRAP) observed in alcohol-exposed women may increase alcohol-induced oxidative damage and potentiate alcohol teratogenicity. This continuing study will determine whether maternal nutrient status, before and after micronutrient supplementation, can modulate the risk for FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts physical, neurological, and behavioral development, leading to a range of effects referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The outcome among children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy varies widely and some of this variation may be due to nutritional factors. We have been examining the effects of manipulating levels of choline, a nutrient that is essential for brain development and function, on alcohol's teratogenic effects. Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed diets containing either 40% or 100% recommended choline levels throughout pregnancy. Subjects were exposed to 6.0 g/kg/day ethanol from gestational days 5-20 via intubation; pair-fed and ad lib chow controls were included. The moderate choline deficiency exacerbated ethanol's adverse effects on physical and behavioral development, including deficit in hind-limb coordination and overactivity in the open field. In contrast, choline supplementation (250 mg/kg/day) during prenatal alcohol exposure (6.0 g/kg/day) reduces the severity of alcohol-induced body weight deficits, physical defects and deficits in psychomotor and cognitive development. Moreover, choline supplementation during the postnatal period, after alcohol exposure has ceased, can reduce the severity of alcohol-induced overactivity in the open field as well as alcohol-induced deficits on a variety of learning and memory, including working memory, spatial memory, reversal learning, and trace Pavlovian conditioning. These findings suggest that choline may still be effective even after the alcohol-related damage is complete. In sum, these data indicate that even moderate suboptimal nutritional status may exacerbate some of ethanol's teratogenic effects, a finding with important implications for the prevention of FASD. Moreover, these data indicate that choline supplementation, either during prenatal or postnatal development, may serve as an effective treatment for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Central nervous system development and function requires vitamin A (retinol). Retinol has no known activity itself; rather, its metabolite all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) supports most of its biological functions. atRA initiates neurogenesis and dendritic growth in the hippocampus and is required for spatial memory. Super-physiological atRA inhibits neurogenesis and alters cognitive function and behavior. Because abnormal atRA shares pathologies with alcoholism, inhibition of retinol activation into atRA has been credited as contributing to ethanol toxicity, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo by rigorous analysis of atRA during normal vitamin A nutriture. We developed robust analytical techniques, based on LC/MS/MS, to quantify atRA and determine the effects of ethanol. In no instance did ethanol decrease physiological atRA levels in vivo during normal vitamin A nutriture in the tissues analyzed (serum, liver, brain, testis, kidney). Ethanol either increased or had no effect on atRA, despite changes in retinol and retinyl esters (RE), i.e., ethanol caused widespread changes in RE and retinol, but tissue/region specific increases in atRA. Postnatally, ethanol produced large atRA increases in hippocampus and testis, areas sensitive to both ethanol exposure and increased atRA. One-month feeding a liquid diet with 6.5% ethanol (Lieber-DeCarli diet) increased atRA in adult hippocampus (20-fold), cortex (2-fold) and serum (10-fold). Feeding dams the Lieber-DeCarli diet from e13-e18 increased atRA in fetal hippocampus (1.5 to 20-fold) and cortex (2 to 50-fold), depending on blood alcohol content. Tissue-specific increases in retinoid dehydrogenase mRNAs and activities, extra-hepatic retinol concentrations, and atRA catabolism, combined to produce site-specific effects. The ethanol-induced atRA increases in fetal hippocampus and cortex extend beyond the range reported to cause phenotypic changes. Prenatal ethanol exposure, similar to the exposure used here, has been reported to decrease the number of dendritic spines and their length in mouse hippocampus, and causes abnormal architecture in rat hippocampus. Thus, our data of ethanol-induced atRA increases at selective sites in the developing brain, and the literature concluding that increasing atRA modestly causes pathological consequences, suggest that ethanol-induced superphysiological atRA concentrations contributes to ethanol's pathology, including cognitive dysfunction and fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Prevention of alcohol use is difficult thus therapies that ameliorate alcohol's damage are desirable. The severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) increases with parity, implying the depletion of a protective maternal factor, perhaps a nutrient. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in women and causes neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring that parallel FASD. We hypothesized that moderate maternal iron inadequacy (ID) potentiates alcohol's effects upon the developing brain and tested this in rat pups reared on dams fed iron-sufficient (IS) or ID diets. We exposed pups to 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg/day alcohol during the brain growth spurt period via gastric gavage (postnatal days 4-9; P4-9). ID dams had subclinical iron deficiency and were not anemic; their liver iron stores were depleted. In the offspring, ID amplified the reduction of body growth caused by alcohol exposure. At P10, ID pups were anemic, and they had significantly more apoptosis in the cerebellum than did either alcohol-exposed or ID pups separately. During adolescence, the ID-alcohol combination did not affect a select set of neurobehavioral skills involving motor coordination. However, the ID-alcohol combination significantly exacerbated the alcohol-induced deficits of associative learning, measured using delay eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC), a cerebellumdependent task. Their values for conditioned response frequency and amplitude were ~30% of the responses in ID-only or alcohol-only animals. The ID-alcohol combination also significantly impaired outcomes in a second test of associative learning, contextual fear conditioning. This is the first study to show that maternal iron inadequacy profoundly exacerbates alcohol's teratogenicity and its impact upon behavioral outcomes. We propose that maternal iron status is an important modulator of fetal neurobehavioral outcome following alcohol exposure.

N2  - Alcohol drinking during pregnancy is the cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Variability of the outcome of infants exposed to similar amounts of ethanol in utero remains an unresolved issue. Similarities between patients with FASD and patients with mutations in L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1) implicate L1 as a target for ethanol. Several studies have addressed this hypothesis. Our laboratory has shown that (i) ethanol inhibits L1-mediated neurite outgrowth with an IC50 of 3-5 mM; (ii) that downstream signaling of L1 is inhibited by ethanol; and (iii) that the proximal downstream signaling interaction is with p60src. Both L1 and p60src have been described in lipid rafts, specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane enriched in phosphatidylcholine and GM1 ganglioside. Recently we have found that pharmacologic concentrations of ethanol increase the proportion of L1 present in lipid rafts in cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and in an in vivo rat pup model. These results suggest that altered trafficking of L1 through lipid rafts may underlie ethanol's effects on L1 mediated neurite outgrowth. We propose that interventions that normalize L1 trafficking through lipid rafts would minimize ethanol's impact. Namely that choline and GM1 ganglioside supplementation would reduce ethanol's effects on L1 - lipid raft interactions. We further propose that maternal choline and GM1 ganglioside nutritional status may play a role in the severity of fetal outcome. According to this hypothesis, our recent data demonstrate that supplementation of CGN with choline and GM1 ganglioside (C/GM1) reduces the redistribution of L1 to lipid rafts and prevents the inhibition of L1 downstream signaIing. Further, we have shown that C/GM1 supplementation is required for 18 hour to be effective. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ethanol's effects on L1 distribution in lipid rafts underlie the inhibitory effects of ethanol on L1 function and can be ameliorated by maternal choline and GM1 ganglioside nutritional status.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the most important consequences are neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Education has not reduced the incidence of FASD leading to a growing interest in understanding the mechanisms of action for the purpose of developing therapeutic prevention or mitigation strategies. Based on the observation that maternal ethanol consumption reduces maternal and fetal pH, we hypothesized that a pH-sensitive pathway involving the TWIK-related acid sensitive potassium channels (TASKs) is implicated in ethanol-induced injury to the fetal cerebellum, one of the most sensitive targets of prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant sheep received alcohol intravenously (258+/-10 mg/dl peak blood ethanol concentration) or saline in a "3 days/week binge" pattern throughout the third trimester. Quantitative stereological analysis demonstrated that alcohol resulted in a 45% reduction in the total number of fetal cerebellar Purkinje cells, the cell type most sensitive to developmental alcohol exposure. Extracellular pH manipulation to create the same degree and pattern of pH fall caused by ethanol (manipulations large enough to inhibit TASK 1 channels), resulted in a 24% decrease in Purkinje cell number. We determined immunohistochemically that TASK 1 channels are expressed in Purkinje cells and that the TASK 3 isoform is expressed in granule cells of the ovine fetal cerebellum. Pharmacological blockade of both TASK 1 and TASK 3 channels simultaneous with alcohol effectively prevented any reduction in fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell number. We have also demonstrated that alcohol exposure causes both maternal and fetal compartment alterations in plasma amino acid concentrations including glutamine. Glutamine is important in maternal pH homeostasis, the regulation of apoptosis and reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species. These results demonstrate the functional significance of fetal cerebellar two pore domain pH-sensitive channels and establishes them as a potential therapeutic target for prevention of alcohol teratogenesis and raises the possibility that glutamine may provide a nutritional/nutriceutical approach to affect the actions of these channels and or defend maternal pH to protect the fetus.

N2  - The Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD) comprises clinical and basic scientists who collectively aim to expand knowledge about fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). One goal of the CIFASD is the development of neurobehavioral profiles that specifically define FASD, which may assist differential diagnosis or improve treatment. A second goal is to combine data collected using multiple methodologies across multiple sites. This presentation will include 2 analyses. The first focuses on the neurobehavioral profile, and the second on the relation of this profile to measures of dysmorphology. Data were collected using a broad neurobehavioral protocol and dysmorphology examination. Subjects were children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and children with unexposed controls. The alcohol-exposed group included children with and with out fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). For the first analysis, data were analyzed using latent profile analysis (LPA). Twenty-two variables were selected from over 500 neuropsychological variables, based on their ability to distinguish children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls. The resulting profile was successful at distinguishing subjects with FAS from nonexposed controls without FAS with 92% overall accuracy; 87.8% of FAS cases and 95.7% of controls were correctly classified. The same analysis was repeated with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure but without FAS and non-exposed controls with similar results. The overall accuracy was 84.7%; 68.4% of alcohol-exposed cases and 95% of controls were correctly classified. In the second analyses, these neurobehavioral variables were correlated with measures of dysmorphology. Results revealed significant correlations between measures of neurobehavioral function and dysmorphology. Results of these combined analyses will be discussed.
