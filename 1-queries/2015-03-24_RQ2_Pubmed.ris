TI  - White matter integrity of the cerebellar peduncles as a mediator of effects of
      prenatal alcohol exposure on eyeblink conditioning.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22785 [doi]
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are characterized by a range of
      neurodevelopmental deficits that result from prenatal exposure to alcohol. These 
      can include cognitive, behavioural, and neurological impairment, as well as
      structural and functional brain damage. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is among the 
      most sensitive endpoints affected in FASD. The cerebellar peduncles, large
      bundles of myelinated nerve fibers that connect the cerebellum to the brainstem, 
      constitute the principal white matter element of the EBC circuit. Diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI) is used to assess white matter integrity in fibre pathways
      linking brain regions. DTI scans of 54 children with FASD and 23 healthy
      controls, mean age 10.1 +/- 1.0 years, from the Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort
      were processed using voxelwise group comparisons. Prenatal alcohol exposure was
      related to lower fractional anisotropy (FA) bilaterally in the superior
      cerebellar peduncles and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the left middle
      peduncle, effects that remained significant after controlling for potential
      confounding variables. Lower FA and higher MD in these regions were associated
      with poorer EBC performance. Moreover, effects of alcohol exposure on EBC
      decreased significantly after inclusion of these DTI measures in regression
      models, suggesting that these white matter deficits partially mediate the
      relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to EBC. The associations of greater alcohol
      consumption with these DTI measures are largely attributable to greater radial
      diffusivity, possibly indicating poorer myelination. Thus, these data suggest
      that fetal alcohol-related deficits in EBC are attributable, in part, to poorer
      myelination in key regions of the cerebellar peduncles. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. (c)

TI  - The Effect of Prenatal Alcohol Co-Exposure on Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome in
      Infants Born to Mothers in Opioid Maintenance Treatment.
PG  - 1-17
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on 
      the incidence and severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). STUDY DESIGN:
      For this pilot study, 70 pregnant women on opioid maintenance therapy (OMT) were 
      recruited from a perinatal substance abuse clinic. Subjects were categorized into
      three study groups based on the timing of alcohol use during pregnancy as
      assessed by repeated self-reported measures and a comprehensive panel of ethanol 
      biomarkers. NAS outcomes included: duration of hospital stay, the need for
      pharmacological treatment of NAS, newborn age at the initiation of NAS treatment,
      duration of treatment, and cumulative methadone dose administered. RESULTS: The
      study included a large proportion of ethnic minorities (81.4% Hispanic, 5.7%
      American Indian), women with less than a high school education (52.2%) and
      unplanned pregnancy (82.9%). In multivariate analysis, PAE was not associated
      with NAS outcomes; however, one newborn diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
      demonstrated much more severe NAS compared to other PAE infants. Interestingly,
      3rd trimester PAE was associated with a higher prevalence of microcephaly (62.5%)
      compared to the PAE abstaining group (36.8%; p=0.08). CONCLUSION: In this study, 
      PAE was not associated with NAS severity; however, further examination in a
      larger study is needed.

TI  - A South African mixed race lip/philtrum guide for diagnosis of fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders.
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37023 [doi]
AB  - The adverse effects of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy represent a spectrum
      of growth restriction, facial dysmorphology, and neurocognitive challenges in the
      offspring. The continuum of diagnoses is referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD). Short palpebral fissures, a smooth philtrum, and a thin
      vermilion border of the upper lip comprise the three cardinal facial features of 
      FASD. Early attempts to define a smooth philtrum and thin vermilion border of the
      upper lip were subjective. Astley and colleagues introduced a 5-point
      Likert-scaled lip/philtrum guide based on Caucasian North American subjects as an
      objective tool for the evaluation of the facial dysmorphology in FASD. This
      Caucasian guide has been incorporated into all current diagnostic schemes for
      FASD. However, broad international clinical experience with FASD indicates racial
      and ethnic differences with respect to the facial morphology. Because of the
      substantial number of children with FASD in South Africa among the Cape Coloured 
      (mixed race) population in the Western Cape Province, we developed a specific
      lip/philtrum guide for that population. The guide incorporates a 45-degree view
      of the philtrum that enables an enhanced 3-dimensional evaluation of philtral
      height not possible with a frontal view alone. The guide has proven to be a more 
      specific and sensitive tool for evaluation of the facial dysmorphology of FASD in
      the Cape Coloured population than the use of the previous North American
      Caucasian guide and points to the utility of racial and ethnic-specific
      dysmorphology tools in the evaluation of children with suspected FASD. (c) 2015

      gray matter in children with prenatal alcohol exposure.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22772 [doi]
AB  - Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) may have cognitive, behavioral and 
      brain abnormalities. Here, we compare rates of white matter and subcortical gray 
      matter volume change in PAE and control children, and examine relationships
      between annual volume change and arithmetic ability, behavior, and executive
      function. Participants (n = 75 PAE/64 control; age: 7.1-15.9 years) each received
      two structural magnetic resonance scans, approximately 2 years apart. Assessments
      included Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), the Child Behavior
      Checklist and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Subcortical
      white and gray volumes were extracted for each hemisphere. Group volume
      differences were tested using false discovery rate (q < 0.05). Analyses examined 
      group-by-age interactions and group-score interactions for correlations between
      change in volume and raw behavioral scores. Results showed that subjects with PAE
      had smaller volumes than control subjects across the brain. Significant
      group-score interactions were found in temporal and parietal regions for WISC
      arithmetic scores and in frontal and parietal regions for behavioral measures.
      Poorer cognitive/ behavioral outcomes were associated with larger volume
      increases in PAE, while control subjects generally showed no significant
      correlations. In contrast with previous results demonstrating different
      trajectories of cortical volume change in PAE, our results show similar rates of 
      subcortical volume growth in subjects with PAE and control subjects. We also
      demonstrate abnormal brain-behavior relationships in subjects with PAE,
      suggesting different use of brain resources. Our results are encouraging in that,
      due to the stable volume differences, there may be an extended window of
      opportunity for intervention in children with PAE. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. (c) 2015

AB  - The range of defects that fall within fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD)
      includes persistent behavioral problems, with anxiety and depression being two of
      the more commonly reported issues. Previous studies of rodent FASD models suggest
      that interference with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis structure and/or
      function may be the basis for some of the prenatal alcohol (ethanol) exposure
      (PAE)-induced behavioral abnormalities. Included among the previous
      investigations are those illustrating that maternal alcohol treatment limited to 
      very early stages of pregnancy (i.e., gestational day [GD]7 in mice; equivalent
      to the third week post-fertilization in humans) can cause structural
      abnormalities in areas such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and other
      forebrain regions integral to controlling stress and behavioral responses. The
      current investigation was designed to further examine the sequelae of prenatal
      alcohol insult at this early time period, with particular attention to HPA
      axis-associated functional changes in adult mice. The results of this study
      reveal that GD7 PAE in mice causes HPA axis dysfunction, with males and females
      showing elevated corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
      levels, respectively, following a 15-min restraint stress exposure. Males also
      showed elevated CORT levels following an acute alcohol injection of 2.0 g/kg,
      while females displayed blunted ACTH levels. Furthermore, analysis showed that
      anxiety-like behavior was decreased after GD7 PAE in female mice, but was
      increased in male mice. Collectively, the results of this study show that early
      gestational alcohol exposure in mice alters long-term HPA axis activity and
      behavior in a sexually dimorphic manner.

TI  - Emotion recognition in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.
PG  - 1-21
AB  - There is a limited amount of research that examines social-emotional functioning 
      in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and the majority of it
      relies on parent and teacher reports of social impairments. Because these provide
      broad measures of social function, they fail to elucidate the underlying specific
      skills with which this group of children has difficulty. The current study
      examines emotion-recognition abilities in children with FASD, as it plays a
      central role in social interaction. Participants were 22 children with diagnosed 
      FASD (ages 8-14), and age- and gender-matched typically developing controls.
      Tasks included measures of emotion recognition from three nonlinguistic
      modalities: facial expressions, emotional tone of voice, and body positioning and
      movement. Participant's parents completed measures of adaptive and behavioral
      function that were related to children's performance on aspects of emotion
      recognition. Overall, the results show that children with FASD have more
      difficulties with emotion recognition than typically developing age-matched
      peers, but these difficulties may not be clinically significant (e.g., smaller
      effect size) or may be specific to the age of the individual exhibiting the
      emotion (i.e., child vs. adult). These results are discussed in the context of
      previous studies.

TI  - The Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS) Gene and Neuroprotection Against
      Alcohol Toxicity.
AB  - When a mother abuses alcohol during pregnancy, the offspring can suffer a myriad 
      of abnormalities, collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).
      Foremost among these abnormalities is central nervous system dysfunction, which
      commonly manifests itself as mental retardation, clumsiness, hyperactivity, and
      poor attention span. These behavior problems are due, in large part, to
      alcohol-induced neuronal losses in the developing fetal brain. However, not all
      fetuses are equally affected by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
      While some fetuses are severely affected and develop hallmarks of FASD later in
      life, others exhibit no evident neuropathology or behavioral abnormalities. This 
      variation is likely due, at least in part, to differences in fetal genetics. This
      review focuses on one particular gene, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, whose
      mutation worsens alcohol-induced neuronal death, both in vitro and in vivo. In
      addition, ectopic expression of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase gene protects 
      neurons against alcohol toxicity. The gene encodes an enzyme that produces nitric
      oxide (NO), which facilitates the protective effects of neuronal growth factors
      and which underlies the ability of neurons to resist alcohol toxicity as they
      mature. Nitric oxide exerts its protective effects against alcohol via a specific
      signaling pathway, the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway. Pharmacologic manipulation of this
      pathway could be of therapeutic use in preventing or ameliorating FASD.

TI  - Screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders by nonmedical community workers.
PG  - e442-52
AB  - BackgroundSouth Africa has the highest prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorders (FASD) in the world yet many women have no access to clinic care or to 
      physicians in their communities. The shortage of physicians trained in the
      diagnosis of FASD is even more severe. Thus there is a need to train community
      workers to assist in the delivery of health care. Objectives This study reports
      on the effectiveness of training community workers to screen for a possible
      diagnosis of a FASD. Methods Community workers in Cape Town, South Africa were
      trained to screen for FASD in 139, 18-month-old toddlers with prenatal alcohol
      exposure (PAE). Children were assessed according to the salient characteristics
      of individuals with PAE using height, weight, head circumference (OFC), philtrum,
      and lip measurements according to criteria set forth by the Institute of
      Medicine. Screen-positive children were referred for diagnostic assessment to a
      pediatrician reliably trained in the diagnosis of FASD. Results Of the
      screen-positive children, 93% received an FASD diagnosis suggesting that the
      screening procedure was highly sensitive. Diagnoses included 15% with fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS), 23% with Partial FAS, and 62% with Alcohol Related
      Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND, provisional). Conclusion The use of community 
      workers to screen for FASD represents a promising approach to effective diagnosis
      of children affected by PAE in areas lacking adequate medical resources.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome among children aged 7-9 years - Arizona, Colorado, and New
      York, 2010.
PG  - 54-7
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a serious birth defect and developmental disorder
      caused by in utero exposure to alcohol. Assessment of the public health burden of
      FAS through surveillance has proven difficult; there is wide variation in
      reported prevalence depending on the study population and surveillance method.
      Generally, records-based birth prevalence studies report estimates of 0.2-1.5 per
      1,000 live births, whereas studies that use in-person, expert assessment of
      school-aged children in a community report estimates of 6-9 per 1,000 population.
      The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network II addressed some of the
      challenges in records-based ascertainment by assessing a period prevalence of FAS
      among children aged 79 years in Arizona, Colorado, and New York. The prevalence
      across sites ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 per 1,000 children. Prevalence of FAS was
      highest among American Indian/Alaska Native children and lowest among Hispanic
      children. These estimates continue to be much lower than those obtained from
      studies using in-person, expert assessment. Factors that might contribute to this
      discrepancy include 1) inadequate recognition of the physical and behavioral
      characteristics of FAS by clinical care providers; 2) insufficient documentation 
      of those characteristics in the medical record; and 3) failure to consider
      prenatal alcohol exposure with diagnoses of behavioral and learning problems.
      Addressing these factors through training of medical and allied health providers 
      can lead to practice changes, ultimately increasing recognition and documentation
      of the characteristics of FAS.

TI  - Preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancy among an American Indian/Alaska Native
      population: effect of a screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment 
      intervention.
PG  - 126-35
LID - 10.1111/acer.12607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the result of alcohol-exposed
      pregnancies (AEP) and believed to be the leading known cause of developmental
      disabilities in the United States. Our objective was to determine whether a
      culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment
      (SBIRT) intervention may reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among
      American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women in Southern California. METHODS:
      Southern California AIAN women of childbearing age who completed a survey
      including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use were
      randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former group 
      completed an online SBIRT intervention, and were followed up at 1, 3, and 6
      months postintervention. RESULTS: Of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up
      data, one-third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment
      groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior (drinks per week, p <
      0.001; frequency of heavy episodic [binge] drinking episodes per 2 weeks, p =
      0.017 and risk of AEP p < 0.001 at 6 months postintervention) in the follow-up
      period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Baseline factors
      associated with decreased risk of an AEP at follow-up included the perception
      that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per
      week, having reported a greater number of binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, and
      depression/impaired functionality. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in assessment alone
      may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the
      web-based SBIRT intervention. Randomization to the SBIRT did not result in a
      significantly different change in risky drinking behaviors. The importance of
      perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/functionality may
      have implications for future interventions.

AB  - The Math Interactive Learning Experience (MILE), a program designed to address
      academic and behavioral problems found in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorders (FASD), was found to be effective in a randomized clinical trials with 
      results that persisted at a 6-month follow-up. The current study evaluated the
      effectiveness of a community translation, in partnership with several community
      sites in the metropolitan Atlanta area. A total of 60 participants were randomly 
      assigned to one of the three treatment groups: the MILE program administered at a
      specialty care center (Center MILE) or in the community (Community MILE), or to
      parent math instruction only (Parent Instruction). This study evaluated
      instructor satisfaction with the training program, knowledge related to FASD and 
      the MILE program, adherence to the MILE teaching methodology, participant math
      outcomes, and parents' satisfaction with their treatment experience. Instructors 
      reported a high degree of satisfaction with the overall training and mean site
      fidelity ratings were positively correlated with change in math performance.
      Those in the MILE intervention groups demonstrated more positive gains in math
      skills than those in the Parent Instruction group but did not differ from each
      other. Parents in the Parent Instruction group reported less satisfaction with
      their intervention than those assigned to the Center MILE group but satisfaction 
      ratings did not differ between those in the MILE intervention groups. These
      results indicate that the community translation and the MILE instructor training 
      program developed as part of this process were well-received and effective in
      producing positive treatment outcomes.

LID - 10.1111/jpc.12814 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Aboriginal leaders concerned about high rates of alcohol use in pregnancy
      invited researchers to determine the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
      and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) in their communities. METHODS:
      Population-based prevalence study using active case ascertainment in children
      born in 2002/2003 and living in the Fitzroy Valley, in Western Australia (April
      2010-November 2011) (n = 134). Socio-demographic and antenatal data, including
      alcohol use in pregnancy, were collected by interview with 127/134 (95%)
      consenting parents/care givers. Maternal/child medical records were reviewed.
      Interdisciplinary assessments were conducted for 108/134 (81%) children. FAS/pFAS
      prevalence was determined using modified Canadian diagnostic guidelines. RESULTS:
      In 127 pregnancies, alcohol was used in 55%. FAS or pFAS was diagnosed in 13/108 
      children, a prevalence of 120 per 1000 (95% confidence interval 70-196). Prenatal
      alcohol exposure was confirmed for all children with FAS/pFAS, 80% in the first
      trimester and 50% throughout pregnancy. Ten of 13 mothers had Alcohol Use
      Disorders Identification Test scores and all drank at a high-risk level. Of
      children with FAS/pFAS, 69% had microcephaly, 85% had weight deficiency and all
      had facial dysmorphology and central nervous system abnormality/impairment in
      three to eight domains. CONCLUSIONS: The population prevalence of FAS/pFAS in
      remote Aboriginal communities of the Fitzroy Valley is the highest reported in
      Australia and similar to that reported in high-risk populations internationally. 
      Results are likely to be generalisable to other age groups in the Fitzroy Valley 
      and other remote Australian communities with high-risk alcohol use during
      pregnancy. Prevention of FAS/pFAS is an urgent public health challenge.

      alcohol exposure.
PG  - 264-70
LID - 10.1542/peds.2014-2171 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to assess the rate of misdiagnosis and 
      missed diagnoses of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among a population of
      foster and adopted youth referred to a children's mental health center. METHODS: 
      Data were collected from a sample of 547 children who underwent a comprehensive
      multidisciplinary diagnostic evaluation. Utilizing current diagnostic criteria,
      children were diagnosed, as appropriate, with fetal alcohol syndrome, partial
      fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, or
      alcohol-related birth defects. Changes in rates of alcohol exposure-related
      diagnoses and cooccurring mental health disorders pre- and postassessment were
      analyzed by using McNemar's test for dependent proportions. RESULTS: Among 156
      children and adolescents who met criteria for a diagnosis within the fetal
      alcohol spectrum, 125 had never been diagnosed as affected by prenatal alcohol
      exposure, a missed diagnosis rate of 80.1%. Of the 31 who had been recognized
      before referral as affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, 10 children's FASD
      diagnoses were changed within the spectrum, representing a misdiagnosis rate of
      6.4%. The remaining 21 (13.5%) children's diagnoses stayed the same. There also
      were significant changes in the rate of mental health diagnosis, and learning
      disorders, communication disorders, and intellectual disability, objective signs 
      of neurocognitive damage, were not recognized in a significant number of children
      with FASD. CONCLUSIONS: Within this clinical sample, 86.5% of youth with FASD had
      never been previously diagnosed or had been misdiagnosed. These high rates of
      missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis have significant implications for intervention 
      and therapeutic services.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause dysregulation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which may underlie some of the
      behavioral and adaptive problems seen in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum 
      Disorders (FASD). Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol show altered basal and
      post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond 2 years of
      age. It is also unknown if cortisol levels can be normalized through intervention
      programs. In this study, we investigated the effects of a physical activity
      program for children with FASD to determine: 1) if HPA dysregulation persists in 
      school-age children with FASD, and 2) the effect of our program on cortisol
      levels. Twenty six children (ages 6-14 years) with FASD participated in an 8 week
      motor skill development program. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 24
      children and compared at 4 time points: before, immediately after, 3 months, and 
      1 year after program completion. Cortisol levels were also compared to 32 control
      children to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA
      regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3
      times in the diurnal cycle: awakening, after school, and just before bedtime.
      Cortisol levels were significantly higher in the afternoon and at bedtime in
      children with FASD with confirmed prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol
      (alcohol exposure rank 4), compared with Control children or children with FASD
      with exposure to low or unknown levels of alcohol (alcohol exposure rank 3). The 
      program did not significantly affect cortisol levels in children with FASD as a
      group. These results provide support for long-term effects of prenatal alcohol
      exposure on the HPA system in humans, which could increase vulnerability to
      mental health issues and diseases later in life.

TI  - Prenatal ethanol exposure impairs executive function in mice into adulthood.
PG  - 2962-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to a
      wide range of impairments in cognitive, social, and emotional behaviors, drinking
      during pregnancy remains common. Although there is a general understanding that
      high levels of drinking during pregnancy are unsafe, conflicting evidence
      regarding the impact of low intake may account for the persistence of this
      behavior. METHODS: To investigate the effects of PAE on learning and executive
      control, we utilized a voluntary paradigm where pregnant mice had access to a
      saccharin-sweetened 10% alcohol solution for 4 hours, during the dark cycle,
      throughout gestation. Male and female offspring were tested as adults on a
      touch-screen discrimination and reversal task mediated by corticostriatal
      circuits. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, PAE did not lead to gross
      morphological, motor, or sensory alterations in offspring. Both PAE and saccharin
      control female mice were slower to acquire the discrimination than males, but PAE
      did not impair associative learning in either sex. During reversal, PAE led to a 
      specific and significant impairment in the early phase, where cortical control is
      most required to flexibly alter choice behavior. PAE mice showed a significant
      increase in maladaptive perseverative responses but showed intact learning of the
      new association during late reversal. CONCLUSIONS: Previously, data from clinical
      studies have suggested that executive control deficits may underlie cognitive, as
      well as social, problems seen in adolescents with documented PAE. These data
      demonstrate that even more moderate alcohol exposure during development can lead 
      to impaired cognitive functioning well into adulthood.

TI  - Embryo transfers between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice: Examination of a maternal
      effect on ethanol teratogenesis.
PG  - 436
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2014.00436 [doi]
AB  - Genetic factors influence fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) in both humans
      and animals. Experiments using inbred and selectively bred mouse stocks that
      controlled for (1) ethanol dose, (2) maternal and fetal blood ethanol levels, and
      (3) fetal developmental exposure stage, show genotype can affect teratogenic
      outcome. Other experiments distinguish the teratogenic effects mediated by
      maternal genotype from those mediated by fetal genotype. One technique to
      distinguish maternal versus fetal genotype effect is to utilize embryo transfers.
      This study is the first to examine ethanol teratogenesis - fetal weight deficits 
      and mortality, and digit, kidney, and vertebral malformations - in C57BL/6J (B6) 
      and DBA/2J (D2) fetuses that were transferred as blastocysts into B6 and D2 dams.
      We hypothesized that, following maternal alcohol exposure, B6 and D2 fetuses
      gestating within B6 mothers, as compared to D2 mothers, will exhibit a higher
      frequency of malformations. On day 9 of pregnancy, females were intubated (IG)
      with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or maltose-dextrin (MD). Other females were
      mated within strain and treated with either ethanol or maltose, or were not
      exposed to either treatment. Implantation rates were affected by genotype.
      Results show more B6 embryos implanted into D2 females than B6 females (p < 0.05;
      47% vs. 23%, respectively). There was no difference in the percentage of D2
      embryos implanting into B6 and D2 females (14 and 16%, respectfully). Litter
      mortality averaged 24% across all experimental groups. Overall, in utero ethanol 
      exposure reduced mean litter weight compared to maltose treatment (E = 1.01 g; MD
      = 1.19 g; p < 0.05); but maltose exposed litters with transferred embryos weighed
      more than similarly treated natural litters (1.30 g vs. 1.11 g; p < 0.05).
      Approximately 50% of all ethanol exposed B6 fetuses exhibited some malformation
      (digit, vertebral, and/or kidney) regardless of whether they were transferred
      into a B6 or D2 female, or were naturally conceived. This suggests the D2
      maternal uterine environment did not offer any protection against ethanol
      teratogenesis for B6 fetuses. One of the questions remaining is the how the B6
      uterine environment affects D2 teratogenesis. No definitive conclusions can be
      drawn because too few viable D2 litters were produced.

TI  - Looking further upstream to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in Canada.
PG  - e450-2
AB  - Half of all pregnancies in Canada are unintended. Whether a pregnancy is intended
      or unintended has a bearing on the risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. Research
      indicates that women who experience an unintended pregnancy are significantly
      more likely to consume alcohol while pregnant. Most fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorder (FASD) prevention frameworks in Canada have adopted a mid-stream
      approach focused on preventing alcohol consumption among women who are already
      pregnant. Yet there is a second approach, further upstream, that is rarely
      discussed as an FASD prevention tool in this country - preventing unintended
      pregnancy itself. Improving access to long-acting reversible contraceptives for
      women and girls who are experiencing cost and access barriers to these methods
      could do much to stem the incidence of FASD and the prohibitive health and social
      costs associated with this disorder in Canada.

TI  - Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and quantification of social behavior in adult
      rats.
LID - 10.3791/52407 [doi]
AB  - Alterations in social behavior are among the major negative consequences observed
      in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs). Several independent
      laboratories have demonstrated robust alterations in the social behavior of
      rodents exposed to alcohol during brain development across a wide range of
      exposure durations, timing, doses, and ages at the time of behavioral
      quantification. Prior work from this laboratory has identified reliable
      alterations in specific forms of social interaction following moderate prenatal
      alcohol exposure (PAE) in the rat that persist well into adulthood, including
      increased wrestling and decreased investigation. These behavioral alterations
      have been useful in identifying neural circuits altered by moderate PAE(1), and
      may hold importance for progressing toward a more complete understanding of the
      neural bases of PAE-related alterations in social behavior. This paper describes 
      procedures for performing moderate PAE in which rat dams voluntarily consume
      ethanol or saccharin (control) throughout gestation, and measurement of social
      behaviors in adult offspring.

TI  - Using optical coherence tomography to rapidly phenotype and quantify congenital
      heart defects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.
LID - 10.1002/dvdy.24246 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most commonly used method to analyze congenital heart defects
      involves serial sectioning and histology. However, this is often a time-consuming
      process where the quantification of cardiac defects can be difficult due to
      problems with accurate section registration. Here we demonstrate the advantages
      of using optical coherence tomography, a comparatively new and rising technology,
      to phenotype avian embryo hearts in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome where a
      binge-like quantity of alcohol/ethanol was introduced at gastrulation. RESULTS:
      The rapid, consistent imaging protocols allowed for the immediate identification 
      of cardiac anomalies, including ventricular septal defects and misaligned/missing
      vessels. Interventricular septum thicknesses and vessel diameters for three of
      the five outflow arteries were also significantly reduced. Outflow and
      atrioventricular valves were segmented using image processing software and had
      significantly reduced volumes compared to controls. This is the first study to
      our knowledge that has 3D reconstructed the late-stage cardiac valves in precise 
      detail to examine their morphology and dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: We believe,
      therefore, that optical coherence tomography, with its ability to rapidly image
      and quantify tiny embryonic structures in high resolution, will serve as an
      excellent and cost-effective preliminary screening tool for developmental
      biologists working with a variety of experimental/disease models. Developmental

AB  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is caused by prenatal alcohol exposure,
      producing craniofacial, sensory, motor, and cognitive defects. FASD is highly
      prevalent in low socioeconomic populations, which are frequently accompanied by
      malnutrition. FASD-associated ocular pathologies include microphthalmia, optic
      nerve hypoplasia, and cataracts. The present study characterizes specific retinal
      tissue defects, identifies ethanol-sensitive stages during retinal development,
      and dissects the effect of nutrient supplements, such as retinoic acid (RA) and
      folic acid (FA) on ethanol-induced retinal defects. Exposure to
      pathophysiological concentrations of ethanol (during midblastula transition
      through somitogenesis; 2-24 h post fertilization [hpf]) altered critical
      transcription factor expression involved in retinal cell differentiation, and
      produced severe retinal ganglion cell, photoreceptor, and Muller glial
      differentiation defects. Ethanol exposure did not alter retinal cell
      differentiation induction, but increased retinal cell death and proliferation. RA
      and FA nutrient co-supplementation rescued retinal photoreceptor and ganglion
      cell differentiation defects. Ethanol exposure during retinal morphogenesis
      stages (16-24 hpf) produced retinal defects like those seen with ethanol exposure
      between 2 and 24 hpf. Significantly, during an ethanol-sensitive time window
      (16-24 hpf), RA co-supplementation moderately rescued these defects, whereas FA
      co-supplementation showed significant rescue of optic nerve and photoreceptor
      differentiation defects. Interestingly, RA, but not FA, supplementation after
      ethanol exposure could reverse ethanol-induced optic nerve and photoreceptor
      differentiation defects. Our results indicate that various ethanol-sensitive
      events underlie FASD-associated retinal defects. Nutrient supplements like
      retinoids and folate were effective in alleviating ethanol-induced retinal
      defects.

AB  - The significant consequences of ethanol use during pregnancy are neurobehavioral 
      abnormalities involving hippocampal and neocortex malfunctions that cause
      learning and memory deficits collectively named fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. 
      However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are still poorly
      understood and therefore warrant systematic research. Here, we document novel
      epigenetic abnormalities in the mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.
      Ethanol treatment of P7 mice, which induces activation of caspase 3, impaired DNA
      methylation through reduced DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3A) levels.
      Inhibition of caspase 3 activity, before ethanol treatment, rescued DNMT1, DNMT3A
      proteins as well as DNA methylation levels. Blockade of histone methyltransferase
      (G9a) activity or cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1R), prior to ethanol treatment,
      which, respectively, inhibits or prevents activation of caspase 3, rescued the
      DNMT1 and DNMT3A proteins and DNA methylation. No reduction of DNMT1 and DNMT3A
      proteins and DNA methylation was found in P7 CB1R null mice, which exhibit no
      ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3. Together, these data demonstrate that
      ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3 impairs DNA methylation through DNMT1 and
      DNMT3A in the neonatal mouse brain, and such impairments are absent in CB1R null 
      mice. Epigenetic events mediated by DNA methylation may be one of the essential
      mechanisms of ethanol teratogenesis. Schematic mechanism of action by which
      ethanol impairs DNA methylation. Studies have demonstrated that ethanol has the
      capacity to bring epigenetic changes to contribute to the development of fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). However, the mechanisms are not well studied.
      P7 ethanol induces the activation of caspase 3 and impairs DNA methylation
      through reduced DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3A) proteins (-->). The
      inhibition or genetic ablation of cannabinoid receptor type-1 or inhibition of
      histone methyltransferase (G9a) by Bix (-----) or inhibition of caspase 3
      activation by Q- quinoline-Val-Asp(Ome)-CH2-O-phenoxy (Q-VD-OPh) () rescue loss
      of DNMT1, DNMT3A as well as DNA methylation. Hence, the putative DNMT1/DNMT3A/DNA
      methylation mechanism may have a potential regulatory role in FASD.

AB  - Excessive ethanol exposure is detrimental to the brain. The developing brain is
      particularly vulnerable to ethanol such that prenatal ethanol exposure causes
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Neuronal loss in the brain is the most
      devastating consequence and is associated with mental retardation and other
      behavioral deficits observed in FASD. Since alcohol consumption during pregnancy 
      has not declined, it is imperative to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and
      develop effective therapeutic strategies. One cellular mechanism that acts as a
      protective response for the central nervous system (CNS) is autophagy. Autophagy 
      regulates lysosomal turnover of organelles and proteins within cells, and is
      involved in cell differentiation, survival, metabolism, and immunity. We have
      recently shown that ethanol activates autophagy in the developing brain. The
      autophagic preconditioning alleviates ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis, whereas
      inhibition of autophagy potentiates ethanol-stimulated reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) and exacerbates ethanol-induced neuroapoptosis. The expression of genes
      encoding proteins required for autophagy in the CNS is developmentally regulated;
      their levels are much lower during an ethanol-sensitive period than during an
      ethanol-resistant period. Ethanol may stimulate autophagy through multiple
      mechanisms; these include induction of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum
      stress, modulation of MTOR and AMPK signaling, alterations in BCL2 family
      proteins, and disruption of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. This review
      discusses the most recent evidence regarding the involvement of autophagy in
      ethanol-mediated neurotoxicity as well as the potential therapeutic approach of
      targeting autophagic pathways.

TI  - Amphetamine sensitization and cross-sensitization with acute restraint stress:
      impact of prenatal alcohol exposure in male and female rats.
AB  - RATIONALE: Individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) are at
      increased risk for substance use disorders (SUD). In typically developing
      individuals, susceptibility to SUD is associated with alterations in dopamine and
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) systems, and their interactions. Prenatal
      alcohol exposure (PAE) alters dopamine and HPA systems, yet effects of PAE on
      dopamine-HPA interactions are unknown. Amphetamine-stress cross-sensitization
      paradigms were utilized to investigate sensitivity of dopamine and stress (HPA)
      systems, and their interactions following PAE. METHODS: Adult Sprague-Dawley
      offspring from PAE, pair-fed, and ad libitum-fed control groups were assigned to 
      amphetamine-(1-2 mg/kg) or saline-treated conditions, with injections every other
      day for 15 days. Fourteen days later, all animals received an amphetamine
      challenge (1 mg/kg) and 5 days later, hormones were measured under basal or acute
      stress conditions. Amphetamine sensitization (augmented locomotion, days 1-29)
      and cross-sensitization with acute restraint stress (increased stress hormones,
      day 34) were assessed. RESULTS: PAE rats exhibited a lower threshold for
      amphetamine sensitization compared to controls, suggesting enhanced sensitivity
      of dopaminergic systems to stimulant-induced changes. Cross-sensitization between
      amphetamine (dopamine) and stress (HPA hormone) systems was evident in PAE, but
      not in control rats. PAE males exhibited increased dopamine receptor expression
      (medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)) compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: PAE alters
      induction and expression of sensitization/cross-sensitization, as reflected in
      locomotor, neural, and endocrine changes, in a manner consistent with increased
      sensitivity of dopamine and stress systems. These results provide insight into
      possible mechanisms that could underlie increased prevalence of SUD, as well as
      the impact of widely prescribed stimulant medications among adolescents with
      FASD.

TI  - Incidence and prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder by sex and age group 
      in Alberta, Canada.
PG  - e395-404
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate incidence and prevalence of FASD by sex and age in
      Alberta, Canada. METHODS: We included all patients recorded in the Alberta
      provincial health databases of inpatients, outpatients, and practitioner claims
      from 2003 to 2012. The number of people with FASD were calculated from available 
      data on FAS (ICD-9 code 760.71; ICD-10 codes Q86.0 and P04.3) and estimated
      prevalence of FASD among individuals diagnosed with 21 FASD-related conditions
      (identified by a literature review) for which there are ICD codes, such as
      learning disability, mental retardation, and nervous system defects (Table 1).
      Fractions of FASD-related diagnoses that can be attributed to alcohol use during 
      pregnancy were estimated by a systematic review. The incidence was measured as
      the number of new cases per 1000 births. The prevalence was measured as the
      number of cases per 1000 population in 2012. RESULTS: Annually, 739 to 1884
      people were born with FASD in Alberta establishing an incidence of 14.2 to 43.8
      per 1000 births, depending on the length of follow-up. There were about 46,000
      people living with FASD in Alberta 2012, including 6,000 FAS cases and 40,000
      FASD-related cases. The prevalence of FASD was 11.7 (range 8.2 to 15.1) per 1000 
      population. The incidence and prevalence varied greatly by sex and age group.
      Generally, male and younger outnumbered female and older. CONCLUSION: This study 
      suggests new incidence and prevalence of FASD, which are higher than what has
      been commonly used (1%), and its variations among sex and age groups.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders among children in a Brazilian orphanage.
LID - 10.1002/bdra.23326 [doi]
AB  - Background: The objective was to investigate the frequency of fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD) and ophthalmologic anomalies in orphanage children in
      Brazil. Methods: A prospective study was performed on 94 children living in an
      orphanage in Brazil. The children were examined by a multidisciplinary team
      consisting of specialists in pediatrics, neurology, psychology, neuropsychiatry, 
      and ophthalmology. Results: The main reasons for living in the orphanage, in 61% 
      of the children, were negligence, child abuse, and abandonment. Of all the
      children studied, 50% had mothers with known alcohol abuse and 47% had one or
      more diagnoses of neurodevelopmental/behavioral and/or cognitive deficits.
      General developmental delay was found in 18%, intellectual disability in 3%,
      cognitive impairment in 27%, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in 14%, and
      autism in 3%. Altogether 17% had FASD, comprising three children with fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS), six with partial FAS, and seven with alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorder. 16% had ophthalmological findings such as poor
      vision, strabismus, and dysmorphology of the optic nerves. Twenty-eight children 
      (30%) were adopted from the orphanage; of these, six had FASD (two FAS, three
      partial FAS, one alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder), five had
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and eight had developmental delay.
      Conclusion: Nearly half of the children living in the orphanage had
      neurodevelopmental disorders and a considerable number showed signs of damage
      from prenatal alcohol exposure. A broader look at the problem of FASD in Brazil
      and other South American countries is desirable to document the burden of disease
      and provide data for targeting prevention efforts. Birth Defects Research (Part

      of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.
PG  - 377
LID - 10.1186/s12884-014-0377-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Midwives are an influential profession and a key group in informing
      women about alcohol consumption in pregnancy and its consequences. There are no
      current quantitative Australian data on midwives' knowledge, attitudes and
      practice in relation to alcohol consumption during pregnancy and Fetal Alcohol
      Spectrum Disorder. We aimed to reduce this knowledge gap by understanding
      midwives' perceptions of their practice in addressing alcohol consumption during 
      pregnancy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at 19 maternity
      sites across the seven health regions of country Western Australia. A
      questionnaire was designed following review of the literature and other relevant 
      surveys. Midwifery managers of the maternity sites distributed questionnaires to 
      all midwives working in their line of management. A total of 334 midwives were
      invited to participate in the research and (n = 245, 73.4%) of these were
      eligible. RESULTS: The response fraction was (n = 166, 67.8%). Nearly all (n =
      151, 93.2%) midwives asked pregnant women about their alcohol consumption during 
      pregnancy and (n = 164, 99.4%) offered advice about alcohol consumption in
      accordance with the Australian Alcohol Guideline, which states "For women who are
      pregnant or planning a pregnancy, not drinking is the safest option". Nearly two 
      thirds (n = 104, 64.2%) of the midwives informed pregnant women about the effects
      of alcohol consumption in pregnancy, they did not always use the recommended
      AUDIT screening tool (n = 66, 47.5%) to assess alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy, nor conduct brief intervention when indicated (n = 107, 70.4%). Most
      midwives endorsed professional development about screening tools (n = 145,
      93.5%), brief intervention (n = 144, 92.9%), and alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy and FASD (n = 144, 92.9%). CONCLUSION: Nearly all midwives in this
      study asked and advised about alcohol consumption in pregnancy and around two
      thirds provided information about the effects of alcohol in pregnancy. Our
      findings support the need for further professional development for midwives on
      screening and brief intervention. Policy should support midwives' practice to
      screen for alcohol consumption in pregnancy and offer brief intervention when
      indicated.

LID - 10.1542/peds.2013-3319 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD) among first grade students (6- to 7-year-olds) in a
      representative Midwestern US community. METHODS: From a consented sample of 70.5%
      of all first graders enrolled in public and private schools, an oversample of
      small children (</= 25th percentile on height, weight, and head circumference)
      and randomly selected control candidates were examined for physical growth,
      development, dysmorphology, cognition, and behavior. The children's mothers were 
      interviewed for maternal risk. RESULTS: Total dysmorphology scores differentiate 
      significantly fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS) from one
      another and from unexposed controls. Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder 
      (ARND) is not as clearly differentiated from controls. Children who had FASD
      performed, on average, significantly worse on 7 cognitive and behavioral tests
      and measures. The most predictive maternal risk variables in this community are
      late recognition of pregnancy, quantity of alcoholic drinks consumed 3 months
      before pregnancy, and quantity of drinking reported for the index child's father.
      From the final multidisciplinary case findings, 3 techniques were used to
      estimate prevalence. FAS in this community likely ranges from 6 to 9 per 1000
      children (midpoint, 7.5), PFAS from 11 to 17 per 1000 children (midpoint, 14),
      and the total rate of FASD is estimated at 24 to 48 per 1000 children, or 2.4% to
      4.8% (midpoint, 3.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Children who have FASD are more prevalent
      among first graders in this Midwestern city than predicted by previous, popular
      estimates.

TI  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: Recent Neuroimaging Findings.
PG  - 161-172
AB  - Since the identification of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome over 40 years ago, much has
      been learned about the detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the
      developing brain. This review highlights recent neuroimaging studies, within the 
      context of previous work. Structural magnetic resonance imaging has described
      morphological differences in the brain and their relationships to cognitive
      deficits and measures of facial dysmorphology. Diffusion tensor imaging has
      elaborated on the relationship between white matter microstructure and behavior. 
      Atypical neuromaturation across childhood and adolescence has been observed in
      longitudinal neuroimaging studies. Functional imaging has revealed differences in
      neural activation patterns underlying sensory processing, cognition and
      behavioral deficits. A recent functional connectivity analysis demonstrates
      reductions in global network efficiency. Despite this progress much remains
      unknown about the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on the brain, and continued
      research efforts are essential.

TI  - Fine motor skills in children with prenatal alcohol exposure or fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder.
PG  - 598-609
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0000000000000107 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can cause fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD) and associated neurodevelopmental impairments. It is uncertain
      which types of fine motor skills are most likely to be affected after PAE or
      which assessment tools are most appropriate to use in FASD diagnostic
      assessments. This systematic review examined which types of fine motor skills are
      impaired in children with PAE or FASD; which fine motor assessments are
      appropriate for FASD diagnosis; and whether fine motor impairments are evident at
      both "low" and "high" PAE levels. METHODS: A systematic review of relevant
      databases was undertaken using key terms. Relevant studies were extracted using a
      standardized form, and methodological quality was rated using a critical
      appraisal tool. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria. Complex fine
      motor skills, such as visual-motor integration, were more frequently impaired
      than basic fine motor skills, such as grip strength. Assessment tools that
      specifically assessed fine motor skills more consistently identified impairments 
      than those which assessed fine motor skills as part of a generalized
      neurodevelopmental assessment. Fine motor impairments were associated with
      "moderate" to "high" PAE levels. Few studies reported fine motor skills of
      children with "low" PAE levels, so the effect of lower PAE levels on fine motor
      skills remains uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive assessment of a range of
      fine motor skills in children with PAE is important to ensure an accurate FASD
      diagnosis and develop appropriate therapeutic interventions for children with
      PAE-related fine motor impairments.

AB  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure results in a range of deficits, including both
      volumetric and functional changes in brain regions involved in response
      inhibition such as the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The current study examined
      blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response during a stop signal task in
      adolescents (ages 13-16y) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, 
      n=21) and controls (CON, n=21). Task performance was measured using percent
      correct inhibits during three difficulty conditions: easy, medium, and hard.
      Group differences in BOLD response relative to baseline motor responding were
      examined across all inhibition trials and for each difficulty condition
      separately. The contrast between hard and easy trials was analyzed to determine
      whether increasing task difficulty affected BOLD response. Groups had similar
      task performance and demographic characteristics, except for full scale IQ scores
      (AE<CON). The AE group demonstrated greater BOLD response in frontal,
      sensorimotor, striatal, and cingulate regions relative to controls, especially as
      task difficulty increased. When contrasting hard vs. easy inhibition trials, the 
      AE group showed greater medial/superior frontal and cuneus BOLD response than
      controls. Results were unchanged after demographics and FAS diagnosis were
      statistically controlled. This was the first fMRI study to utilize a stop signal 
      task, isolating fronto-striatal functioning, to assess response inhibition and
      the effects task difficulty in adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure.
      Results suggest that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts neural function of 
      this circuitry, resulting in immature cognitive processing and motor-association 
      learning and neural compensation during response inhibition.

AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a birth defect due to maternal alcohol
      consumption during pregnancy. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the main 
      somatic stem cells in adults and may contribute to tissue homeostasis and repair 
      in adulthood, we investigated whether early life ethanol exposure affects MSCs
      and contributes to the propensity for disease onset in later life. Using a rodent
      model of FAS, we found that ethanol exposure (5.25g/kg/day) from postnatal days 4
      to 9 in rat pups (mimic of human third trimester) caused long-term anomalies in
      bone marrow-derived MSCs. MSCs isolated from ethanol-exposed animals were prone
      to neural induction but resistant to osteogenic and adipogenic inductions
      compared to their age-matched controls. The altered differentiation may
      contribute to the severe trabecular bone loss seen in ethanol-exposed animals at 
      3months of age as well as overt growth retardation. Expression of alkaline
      phosphatase, osteocalcin, aP2, and PPARgamma were substantially inhibited, but
      BDNF was up-regulated in MSCs isolated from ethanol-exposed 3month-old animals.
      Several signaling pathways were distorted in ethanol-exposed MSCs via altered
      trimethylation at histone 3 lysine 27. These results demonstrate that early life 
      ethanol exposure can have long-term impacts in rat MSCs by both genetic and
      epigenetic mechanisms.

TI  - What does the general public in the UK know about the risk to a developing foetus
      if exposed to alcohol in pregnancy? Findings from a UK mixed methodology study.
LID - 10.1111/cch.12187 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a set of preventable
      conditions where the foetus is exposed to alcohol in utero and as a result
      suffers adverse consequences. To develop a public health strategy related to
      FASD, it is important to first establish what is known by the public about this
      condition. This study aimed to assess the current level of knowledge about FASD
      in the UK general population. METHODS: A mixed methodology study was conducted
      using a 17-item questionnaire and focus group sessions. Four focus groups were
      held with an average of 10 people in each group. Semi-structured questions and
      thematic analysis of interviews alongside quantitative analysis of the
      questionnaire data was completed. The research was approved by an National Health
      service (NHS) research ethical committee. RESULTS: A total of 674 people
      responded to the questionnaire and a majority (86.7%) had heard about FASD, with 
      most receiving their information from the media (26.2%) or from their work
      (27.7%). Four broad themes emerged. Overall these were: a general lack of
      knowledge about the subject; information about the subject needed to be
      personally relevant; there was a need for further education; and there was a lack
      of clarity in the current guidance on alcohol use in pregnancy. DISCUSSION AND
      CONCLUSIONS: Currently there appears to be a superficial level of knowledge about
      FASD in the UK general public. More detailed work in subgroups, such as young
      women, to identify their specific needs may be necessary before targeted public
      health and educational interventions can be developed to meet the needs of the
      general public.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters p35, CDK5 and GSK3beta in the medial frontal
      cortex and hippocampus of adolescent mice.
PG  - 544-553
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the number one cause of preventable 
      mental retardation. An estimated 2-5% of children are diagnosed as having a FASD.
      While it is known that children prenatally exposed to alcohol experience
      cognitive deficits and a higher incidence of psychiatric illness later in life,
      the pathways underlying these abnormalities remain uncertain. GSK3beta and CDK5
      are protein kinases that are converging points for a vast number of signaling
      cascades, including those controlling cellular processes critical to learning and
      memory. We investigated whether levels of GSK3beta and CDK5 are affected by
      moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), specifically in the hippocampus and
      medial frontal cortex of the adolescent mouse. In the present work we utilized
      immunoblotting techniques to demonstrate that moderate PAE increased hippocampal 
      p35 and beta-catenin, and decreased total levels of GSK3beta, while increasing
      GSK3beta Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation. Interestingly, different alterations
      were seen in the medial frontal cortex where p35 and CDK5 were decreased and
      increased total GSK3beta was accompanied by reduced Tyr216 of the enzyme. These
      results suggest that kinase dysregulation during adolescence might be an
      important contributing factor to the effects of PAE on hippocampal and medial
      frontal cortical functioning; and by extension, that global modulation of these
      kinases may produce differing effects depending on brain region.

      abnormalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol is detrimental to early development. Fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD) due to maternal alcohol abuse results in a series of
      developmental abnormalities including cranial facial dysmorphology, ocular
      anomalies, congenital heart defects, microcephaly and intellectual disabilities. 
      Previous studies have been shown that ethanol exposure causes neural crest (NC)
      apoptosis and perturbation of neural crest migration. However, the underlying
      mechanism remains elusive. In this report we investigated the fetal effect of
      alcohol on the process of neural crest development in the Xenopus leavis.
      RESULTS: Pre-gastrulation exposure of 2-4% alcohol induces apoptosis in Xenopus
      embryo whereas 1% alcohol specifically impairs neural crest migration without
      observing discernible apoptosis. Additionally, 1% alcohol treatment considerably 
      increased the phenotype of small head (43.4% +/- 4.4%, total embryo n = 234), and
      1.5% and 2.0% dramatically augment the deformation to 81.2% +/- 6.5% (n = 205)
      and 91.6% +/- 3.0% (n = 235), respectively (P < 0.05). Significant accumulation
      of Homocysteine was caused by alcohol treatment in embryos and
      5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate restores neural crest migration and alleviates
      homocysteine accumulation, resulting in inhibition of the alcohol-induced
      neurocristopathies. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that prenatal alcohol
      exposure causes neural crest cell migration abnormality and
      5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate could be beneficial for treating FASD.

TI  - Neural crest development in fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 210-20
LID - 10.1002/bdrc.21078 [doi]
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a leading cause of neurodevelopmental
      disability. Some affected individuals possess distinctive craniofacial deficits, 
      but many more lack overt facial changes. An understanding of the mechanisms
      underlying these deficits would inform their diagnostic utility. Our
      understanding of these mechanisms is challenged because ethanol lacks a single
      receptor when redirecting cellular activity. This review summarizes our current
      understanding of how ethanol alters neural crest development. Ample evidence
      shows that ethanol causes the "classic" fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) face (short 
      palpebral fissures, elongated upper lip, deficient philtrum) because it
      suppresses prechordal plate outgrowth, thereby reducing neuroectoderm and neural 
      crest induction and causing holoprosencephaly. Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) at
      premigratory stages elicits a different facial appearance, indicating FASD may
      represent a spectrum of facial outcomes. PAE at this premigratory period
      initiates a calcium transient that activates CaMKII and destabilizes
      transcriptionally active beta-catenin, thereby initiating apoptosis within neural
      crest populations. Contributing to neural crest vulnerability are their low
      antioxidant responses. Ethanol-treated neural crest produce reactive oxygen
      species and free radical scavengers attenuate their production and prevent
      apoptosis. Ethanol also significantly impairs neural crest migration, causing
      cytoskeletal rearrangements that destabilize focal adhesion formation; their
      directional migratory capacity is also lost. Genetic factors further modify
      vulnerability to ethanol-induced craniofacial dysmorphology and include genes
      important for neural crest development, including shh signaling, PDFGA, vangl2,
      and ribosomal biogenesis. Because facial and brain development are
      mechanistically and functionally linked, research into ethanol's effects on
      neural crest also informs our understanding of ethanol's CNS pathologies.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure, especially during early pregnancy, can lead to fetal
      alcohol syndrome. The pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms of ethanol are
      related to the effects of ceramide. In this study, we established an alcohol
      exposure model in wild-type mice and in knockout mice for the key enzyme involved
      in ceramide metabolism, sphingomyelin synthase 2. This model received daily
      intragastric administration of 25% ethanol, and pups were used at postnatal days 
      0, 7, 14, 30 for experiments. Serology and immunofluorescence staining found that
      ethanol exposure dose-dependently reduced blood sphingomyelin levels in two
      genotypes of pups, and increased neural cell proliferation and the number of new 
      neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Western blot analysis showed that the
      relative expression level of protein kinase C alpha increased in two notypes of
      pups after ethanol exposure. Compared with wild-type pups, the expression level
      of the important activator protein of the ceramide/ceramide-1-phosphate pathway, 
      protein kinase C alpha, was reduced in the hippocampus of sphingomyelin synthase 
      2 knockouts. Our findings illustrate that ceramide is involved in alcohol-induced
      neural proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of pups after prenatal
      ethanol exposure, and the mechanism may be associated with increased pression of 
      protein kinase C alpha activating the ceramide/ceramide-1-phosphate pathway.

TI  - A DTI-based tractography study of effects on brain structure associated with
      prenatal alcohol exposure in newborns.
PG  - 170-86
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22620 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to have severe, long-term consequences
      for brain and behavioral development already detectable in infancy and childhood.
      Resulting features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders include cognitive and
      behavioral effects, as well as facial anomalies and growth deficits. Diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography were used to analyze white matter (WM)
      development in 11 newborns (age since conception <45 weeks) whose mothers were
      recruited during pregnancy. Comparisons were made with nine age-matched controls 
      born to abstainers or light drinkers from the same Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry)
      community near Cape Town, South Africa. DTI parameters, T1 relaxation time,
      proton density and volumes were used to quantify and investigate group
      differences in WM in the newborn brains. Probabilistic tractography was used to
      estimate and to delineate similar tract locations among the subjects for
      transcallosal pathways, cortico-spinal projection fibers, and cortico-cortical
      association fibers. In each of these WM networks, the axial diffusivity was the
      parameter that showed the strongest association with maternal drinking. The
      strongest relations were observed in medial and inferior WM, regions in which the
      myelination process typically begins. In contrast to studies of older individuals
      with PAE, fractional anisotropy did not exhibit a consistent and significant
      relation with alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first
      DTI-tractography study of prenatally alcohol exposed newborns.

TI  - Effects of all three trimester moderate binge alcohol exposure on the foetal
      hippocampal formation and olfactory bulb.
PG  - 104-109
AB  - Abstract Objective: Pre-natal alcohol exposure results in injury to the
      hippocampus and olfactory bulb, but currently there is no consensus on the
      critical window of vulnerability. This study tested the hypothesis that pre-natal
      exposure to a moderate dose of alcohol during all three trimester-equivalents
      alters development of the hippocampal formation and olfactory bulb in an ovine
      model, where all brain development occurs pre-natally as it does in humans.
      Research design and methods: Pregnant sheep were divided into saline control and 
      a binge drinking groups (alcohol dose 1.75 g kg-1; mean peak blood alcohol
      concentration 189 + 19 mg dl-1). Outcome and results: The density, volume and
      total cell number were not different between groups for the dentate gyrus,
      pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA2/3 fields and mitral cells in the olfactory
      bulb. Conclusions: A moderate dose of alcohol administered in a binge pattern
      throughout gestation does not alter cell numbers in the hippocampus or olfactory 
      bulb and exposure during the third trimester-equivalent is required for
      hippocampal injury, unless very high doses of alcohol are administered. This has 
      important implications in establishing the sensitivity of imaging modalities such
      as MRI in which volumetric measures are being studied as biomarkers for pre-natal
      alcohol exposure.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in long-term cognitive and behavioral
      deficits. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) refers to a range of permanent
      birth defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, and is the most common
      neurodevelopmental disorder in the US. Studies by autopsy and conventional
      structural MRI indicate that the midline structures of the brain are particularly
      vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown
      that abnormalities in brain white matter especially the corpus callosum are very 
      common in FASD. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel technique
      that measures tissue's magnetic property. Such magnetic property is affected by
      tissue microstructure and molecular composition including that of myelin in the
      white matter. In this work, we studied three major white matter fiber bundles of 
      a mouse model of FASD and compared it to control mice using both QSM and DTI. QSM
      revealed clear and significant abnormalities in anterior commissure, corpus
      callosum, and hippocampal commissure, which were likely due to reduced
      myelination. Our data also suggested that QSM may be even more sensitive than DTI
      for examining changes due to prenatal alcohol exposure. Although this is a
      preclinical study, the technique of QSM is readily translatable to human brain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Safe Passage Study is a large, prospective, multidisciplinary
      study designed to (1) investigate the association between prenatal alcohol
      exposure, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and stillbirth, and (2) determine 
      the biological basis of the spectrum of phenotypic outcomes from exposure, as
      modified by environmental and genetic factors that increase the risk of
      stillbirth, SIDS, and in surviving children, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
      METHODS: The results provided are based on an interim assessment of 6004 women
      enrolled, out of the 12,000 projected, from the Northern Plains, US, and Cape
      Town, South Africa, areas known to be of high risk for maternal drinking during
      pregnancy. Research objectives, study design, and descriptive statistics,
      including consent, recruitment, and retention information, are provided. RESULTS:
      Overall visit compliance is 87%, and includes prenatal, delivery/newborn, and
      postnatal contacts through 1 year post-delivery. Pregnancy outcome ascertainment 
      is 98% prior to medical chart review; less than 2% of women withdraw. Consent for
      the use of DNA and placental tissue exceed 94%, and consent to participate in the
      autopsy portion of the study is 71%. CONCLUSIONS: The Safe Passage Study is the
      first multi-site study of SIDS and stillbirth to integrate prospectively
      collected exposure information with multidisciplinary biological information in
      the same maternal and fetal/infant dyad using a common protocol. Essential
      components of the study design and its success are close ties to the community
      and rigorous systems and processes to ensure compliance with the study protocol
      and procedures.

TI  - Developmental Trajectories for Visuo-Spatial Attention are Altered by Prenatal
      Alcohol Exposure: A Longitudinal FMRI Study.
LID - bhu162 [pii]
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals brain activation
      abnormalities during visuo-spatial attention and working memory among those with 
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in cross-sectional reports, but little is
      known about how activation changes over time during development within FASD or
      typically developing children. We studied 30 controls and 31 individuals with
      FASD over 2 years (7-14 years at first participation) with a total of 122 scans, 
      as part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.
      Despite comparable performance, there were significant group differences in
      visuo-spatial activation over time bilaterally in frontal, parietal, and temporal
      regions. Controls showed an increase in signal intensity in these multiple
      regions whereas FASD participants showed a decrease in brain activation. Effects 
      were also found in 2 small independent samples from the USA, corroborating the
      findings from the larger group. Results suggest that the long-lasting effect of
      prenatal alcohol may impact the maturation of visuo-spatial attention and
      differentiate those with FASD from controls. Based on this first longitudinal
      fMRI study in FASD children, our novel findings suggest a possible neural
      mechanism for attention deficits common among individuals with FASD.

TI  - Incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure in Prince Edward Island: a
      population-based descriptive study.
PG  - E121-6
LID - 10.9778/cmajo.20140011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a leading preventable cause
      of neurodevelopmental disability in North America. The stigma associated with
      alcohol use and abuse during pregnancy makes it difficult to obtain information
      on prenatal alcohol use through self-reporting. We assessed the incidence of
      prenatal alcohol exposure in Prince Edward Island to facilitate future public
      health initiatives addressing FASD. METHODS: Prenatal alcohol exposure was
      examined via population-based collection of meconium and analysis of fatty acid
      ethyl esters (FAEEs). Fatty acid ethyl esters are nonoxidative metabolites of
      ethanol that are produced in the fetus. Meconium FAEE concentrations of 2.0
      nmol/g or greater are indicative of frequent prenatal alcohol exposure during the
      last 2 trimesters of pregnancy. Samples were collected from 1307 neonates between
      Nov. 8, 2010, and Nov. 8, 2011, in hospitals in PEI, or from those born to
      mothers who resided in PEI but gave birth in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Samples were
      frozen and shipped for analysis. Fatty acid ethyl esters were analyzed by gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantified by means of deuterated internal
      standards. RESULTS: Of the 1307 samples collected, 1271 samples were successfully
      analyzed. Positive results for FAEEs were obtained in 3.1% (n = 39) of samples
      collected within the first 24 hours after birth. INTERPRETATION: Not all neonates
      exposed to heavy prenatal alcohol in utero will exhibit FASD; based on current
      estimates of predictive value for disease by exposure, our findings suggest that 
      1.3% of neonates born in PEI during this 1-year period will have FASD. In its
      application to an entire provincial birth cohort, this study successfully
      implemented a public health-centred approach for evaluating population-based risk
      of FASD, with implications for practice across Canada.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and adolescent stress - unmasking persistent
      attentional deficits in rats.
PG  - 3078-95
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12671 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can produce a myriad of deficits. Unfortunately, 
      affected individuals may also be exposed to the stress of an adverse home
      environment, contributing to deficits of attentional processes that are the
      hallmark of optimal executive function. Male offspring of ad-libitum-fed Control 
      (Con), Pairfed (PF), and PAE dams were randomly assigned to either a 5-day period
      of variable chronic mild stress (CMS) or no CMS in adolescence. In adulthood,
      rats were trained in a non-match to sample task (T-maze), followed by extensive
      assessment in the five-choice serial reaction time task. Once rats acquired the
      five-choice serial reaction time task (stable accuracy), they were tested in
      three challenge conditions: (i) increased sustained attention, (ii) selective
      attention and, (iii) varying doses of d-amphetamine, an indirect dopamine and
      norepinephrine agonist. At birth and throughout the study, PAE offspring showed
      reduced body weight. Moreover, although PAE animals were similar to Con animals
      in task acquisition, they were progressively less proficient with transitions to 
      shorter stimulus durations (decreased accuracy and increased omissions). Five
      days of adolescent CMS increased basal corticosterone levels in adolescence and
      disrupted cognitive performance in adulthood. Further, CMS augmented PAE-related 
      disturbances in acquisition and, to a lesser extent, also disrupted attentional
      processes in Con and PF animals. Following task acquisition, challenges unmasked 
      persistent attentional difficulties resulting from both PAE and adolescent CMS.
      In conclusion, PAE, adolescent CMS, and their interaction produced unique
      behavioural profiles that suggest vulnerability in select neurobiological
      processes at different stages of development.

TI  - A tensor-based morphometry analysis of regional differences in brain volume in
      relation to prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 152-60
LID - 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.04.001 [doi]
AB  - Reductions in brain volumes represent a neurobiological signature of fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Less clear is how regional brain tissue
      reductions differ after normalizing for brain size differences linked with FASD
      and whether these profiles can predict the degree of prenatal exposure to
      alcohol. To examine associations of regional brain tissue excesses/deficits with 
      degree of prenatal alcohol exposure and diagnosis with and without correction for
      overall brain volume, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) methods were applied to
      structural imaging data from a well-characterized, demographically homogeneous
      sample of children diagnosed with FASD (n = 39, 9.6-11.0 years) and controls (n =
      16, 9.5-11.0 years). Degree of prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly
      associated with regionally pervasive brain tissue reductions in: (1) the
      thalamus, midbrain, and ventromedial frontal lobe, (2) the superior cerebellum
      and inferior occipital lobe, (3) the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and (4) the
      precuneus and superior parietal lobule. When overall brain size was factored out 
      of the analysis on a subject-by-subject basis, no regions showed significant
      associations with alcohol exposure. FASD diagnosis was associated with a similar 
      deformation pattern, but few of the regions survived FDR correction. In
      data-driven independent component analyses (ICA) regional brain tissue
      deformations successfully distinguished individuals based on extent of prenatal
      alcohol exposure and to a lesser degree, diagnosis. The greater sensitivity of
      the continuous measure of alcohol exposure compared with the categorical
      diagnosis across diverse brain regions underscores the dose dependence of these
      effects. The ICA results illustrate that profiles of brain tissue alterations may
      be a useful indicator of prenatal alcohol exposure when reliable historical data 
      are not available and facial features are not apparent.

AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a frequent cause of mental retardation.
      However, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development defects induced by
      maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unclear. We used normal and
      Hsf2-deficient mice and cell systems to uncover a pivotal role for heat shock
      factor 2 (HSF2) in radial neuronal migration defects in the cortex, a hallmark of
      fetal alcohol exposure. Upon fetal alcohol exposure, HSF2 is essential for the
      triggering of HSF1 activation, which is accompanied by distinctive
      post-translational modifications, and HSF2 steers the formation of atypical
      alcohol-specific HSF1-HSF2 heterocomplexes. This perturbs the in vivo binding of 
      HSF2 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in genes that control neuronal migration in
      normal conditions, such as p35 or the MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins, such
      as Dclk1 and Dcx), and alters their expression. In the absence of HSF2, migration
      defects as well as alterations in gene expression are reduced. Thus, HSF2, as a
      sensor for alcohol stress in the fetal brain, acts as a mediator of the neuronal 
      migration defects associated with FASD.

TI  - Executive functioning deficits in preschool children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum 
      Disorders.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - Executive function (EF) deficit is a hallmark of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders
      (FASD), but the vast majority of available evidence comes from school-age
      children and adolescents. Very little is known about EF during the critical
      developmental period prior to 6 years of age in FASD. We evaluated EF in 39
      children with FASD (3.0-5.5 years) and a comparison group of 50 age-matched,
      nonexposed controls. Measures included the EF Scale for Early Childhood and a
      Delay of Gratification task. Compared to age-matched controls, preschool children
      with FASD had impairments on the EF Scale and showed more impulsivity on the
      Delay of Gratification task. To confirm the EF Scale finding, FASD group
      performance was compared to a separate normative dataset (N = 1,400). Those with 
      FASD performed below normal (M = -0.57, SD = 0.92). Within the FASD group, IQ was
      correlated with the EF Scale (partial r = .60, p = .001) and Delay of
      Gratification (partial r = .58, p = .005). EF Scale performance did not differ
      significantly across levels of FASD severity (fetal alcohol syndrome [FAS],
      partial FAS, or alcohol-related neurobehavioral disorder [ARND]). However,
      compared to normative data, those with FAS had the largest deficits (M = -0.91 SD
      from the mean, SE = 0.23), followed by partial FAS (M = -0.66 SD from the mean,
      SE = 0.26), then ARND (M = -0.36 SD from the mean, SE = 0.20). These novel data
      show that EF deficits manifest well before the age of 6 years in children with
      FASD, that they occur across the spectrum, and that EF may be most impaired in
      children with more severe forms of FASD and/or lower IQs.

TI  - "It's better for me to drink, at least the stress is going away": perspectives on
      alcohol use during pregnancy among South African women attending drinking
      establishments.

AB  - The Western Cape of South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD) globally. Reducing alcohol use during pregnancy is a
      pressing public health priority for this region, but insight into the experiences
      of women who drink during pregnancy is lacking. Convenience sampling in
      alcohol-serving venues was used to identify women who were currently pregnant (n 
      = 12) or recently post-partum (n = 12) and reported drinking during the pregnancy
      period. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between April and August
      2013. Interviews explored drinking narratives, with textual data analyzed for
      themes related to factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy. All but 
      one woman reported her pregnancy as unplanned. The majority sustained or
      increased drinking after pregnancy recognition, with patterns typically including
      multiple days of binge drinking per week. Analysis of the textual data revealed
      five primary factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy: 1) women used
      alcohol as a strategy to cope with stressors and negative emotions, including
      those associated with pregnancy; 2) women drank as a way to retain social
      connection, often during a difficult period of life transition; 3) social norms
      in women's peer groups supported drinking during pregnancy; 4) women lacked
      attachment to the pregnancy or were resistant to motherhood; and 5) women were
      driven physiologically by alcohol addiction. Our data suggest that
      alcohol-serving settings are important sites to identify and target women at risk
      of drinking during pregnancy. Intervention approaches to reduce alcohol use
      during pregnancy should include counseling and contraception to prevent unwanted 
      pregnancies, mental health and coping interventions targeting pregnant women,
      peer-based interventions to change norms around perinatal drinking, and treatment
      for alcohol dependence during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that innovative
      interventions that go beyond the boundaries of the health care system are
      urgently needed to address FASD in this region.

TI  - Prevalence and Characteristics of Women at Risk for an Alcohol-Exposed Pregnancy 
      (AEP) in the United States: Estimates from the National Survey of Family Growth.
PG  - 776-82
LID - 10.1007/s10995-014-1563-3 [doi]
AB  - Non-pregnant women can avoid alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEPs) by modifying
      drinking and/or contraceptive practices. The purpose of this study was to
      estimate the number and characteristics of women in the United States who are at 
      risk of AEPs. We analyzed data from in-person interviews obtained from a national
      probability sample (i.e., the National Survey of Family Growth) of
      reproductive-aged women conducted from January 2002 to March 2003. To be at risk 
      of AEP, a woman had to have met the following criteria in the last month: (1) was
      drinking; (2) had vaginal intercourse with a man; and (3) did not use
      contraception. During a 1-month period, nearly 2 million U.S. women were at risk 
      of an AEP (95 % confidence interval 1,760,079-2,288,104), including more than
      600,000 who were binge drinking. Thus, 3.4 %, or 1 in 30, of all non-pregnant
      women were at risk of an AEP. Most demographic and behavioral characteristics
      were not clearly associated with AEP risk. However, pregnancy intention was
      strongly associated with AEP risk (prevalence ratio = 12.0, P < 0.001) because
      women often continued to drink even after they stopped using contraception.
      Nearly 2 million U.S. women are at AEP risk and therefore at risk of having
      children born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. For pregnant women and women
      intending a pregnancy, there is an urgent need for wider implementation of
      prevention programs and policy approaches that can reduce the risk for this
      serious public health problem.

      and change in executive function.
PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.05.010 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a wide range of deficits in executive
      function that persist throughout life, but little is known about how changes in
      brain structure relate to cognition in affected individuals. In the current
      study, we predicted that the rate of white matter volumetric development would be
      atypical in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) when compared
      to typically developing children, and that the rate of change in cognitive
      function would relate to differential white matter development between groups.
      Data were available for 103 subjects [49 with FASD, 54 controls, age range 6-17, 
      mean age = 11.83] with 153 total observations. Groups were age-matched.
      Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an
      executive function (EF) battery. Using white matter volumes measured bilaterally 
      for frontal and parietal regions and the corpus callosum, change was predicted by
      modeling the effects of age, intracranial volume, sex, and interactions with
      exposure status and EF measures. While both groups showed regional increases in
      white matter volumes and improvement in cognitive performance over time, there
      were significant effects of exposure status on age-related relationships between 
      white matter increases and EF measures. Specifically, individuals with FASD
      consistently showed a positive relationship between improved cognitive function
      and increased white matter volume over time, while no such relationships were
      seen in controls. These novel results relating improved cognitive function with
      increased white matter volume in FASD suggest that better cognitive outcomes
      could be possible for FASD subjects through interventions that enhance white
      matter plasticity.

TI  - Gross motor deficits in children prenatally exposed to alcohol: a meta-analysis.
PG  - e192-209
LID - 10.1542/peds.2013-3733 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gross motor (GM) deficits are often reported in
      children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), but their prevalence and the
      domains affected are not clear. The objective of this review was to characterize 
      GM impairment in children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
      (FASD) or "moderate" to "heavy" maternal alcohol intake. METHODS: A systematic
      review with meta-analysis was conducted. Medline, Embase, Allied and
      Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature, PsycINFO, PEDro, and Google Scholar databases were searched.
      Published observational studies including children aged 0 to </=18 years with (1)
      an FASD diagnosis or moderate to heavy PAE, or a mother with confirmed alcohol
      dependency or binge drinking during pregnancy, and (2) GM outcomes obtained by
      using a standardized assessment tool. Data were extracted regarding participants,
      exposure, diagnosis, and outcomes by using a standardized protocol.
      Methodological quality was evaluated by using Strengthening the Reporting of
      Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. RESULTS: The search recovered
      2881 articles of which 14 met the systematic review inclusion criteria. The
      subjects' mean age ranged from 3 days to 13 years. Study limitations included
      failure to report cutoffs for impairment, nonstandardized reporting of PAE, and
      small sample sizes. The meta-analysis pooled results (n = 10) revealed a
      significant association between a diagnosis of FASD or moderate to heavy PAE and 
      GM impairment (odds ratio: 2.9; 95% confidence interval: 2.1-4.0). GM deficits
      were found in balance, coordination, and ball skills. There was insufficient data
      to determine prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The significant results suggest evaluation 
      of GM proficiency should be a standard component of multidisciplinary FASD
      diagnostic services.

TI  - State Responses to Alcohol Use and Pregnancy: Findings From the Alcohol Policy
      Information System (APIS).
PG  - 191-206
AB  - This article describes U.S. state policies related to alcohol use during
      pregnancy, using data from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
      (NIAAA) Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS). Specifically, this study
      examines trends in policies enacted by states over time and types of policies
      enacted across states in the U.S., with a focus on whether laws were supportive
      or punitive toward women. Findings revealed substantial variability in
      characteristics of policies (19 primarily supportive, 12 primarily punitive, 12
      with a mixed approach, and 8 with no policies). Findings underscore the need to
      examine possible consequences of policies, especially of punitive policies and
      "mixed" approaches.

TI  - Education, safe drinking practices and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in the
      Kimberley region of Western Australia.
PG  - 701-6
LID - 10.1111/jpc.12615 [doi]
AB  - AIM: There are alarming rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in the
      Kimberley region of Western Australia despite numerous international studies
      demonstrating the links between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and FASD.
      The aim of this research was to help determine factors that may be associated
      with correct knowledge about safe drinking practices during pregnancy, with these
      factors used to help inform future interventions. METHOD: Ninety-nine residents
      (40 males, 59 females, 39% of which self-identified as Indigenous) from the
      Kimberley region (Broome and smaller remote communities) completed a survey
      examining knowledge of currently recommended safe drinking practices during
      pregnancy and knowledge of the outcomes for children with FASD over a period of
      approximately 2 months. RESULTS: The results revealed that education level (i.e. 
      not completing high school through to completing university) is the biggest
      predictor (beta = 0.44, P < 0.01) of knowledge of safe drinking practices during 
      pregnancy, and having heard of FASD (beta = 0.67, P < 0.001) was the biggest
      predictor of knowledge of outcomes for children with FASD. Other variables such
      as age, sex, Indigenous status and income level were not as important.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that early education regarding the
      consequences of alcohol consumption for women of childbearing age should be
      paramount in this or similar communities. Suggestions for targeted interventions 
      are discussed in light of these findings.

TI  - Evaluation of the neurobehavioral screening tool in children with fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD).
PG  - e197-210
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing need for validated tools to screen children at
      risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The Neurobehavioral Screening
      Tool (NST) is one of several promising screening measures for FASD, though
      further evidence is needed to establish the tool's psychometric utility.
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive accuracy of the NST among children with an
      FASD diagnosis, with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but no FASD diagnosis, and
      typically developing controls. METHOD: The NST was completed by caregivers of
      children ages 6 to 17, including 48 with FASD, 22 with PAE, and 32 typically
      developing non-exposed controls. Predictive accuracy coefficients were calculated
      using Nash et al. (2006) criteria, and compared against controls. An alternative 
      scoring scheme was also investigated to determine optimum referral thresholds
      using item-level total scores. RESULTS: The NST yielded 62.5% sensitivity for
      participants with FASD and 50% for PAE. Specificity values were 100% with no
      typically developing control scoring positive. Within the FASD group there was a 
      trend for higher sensitivity among adolescents aged 12 to17 (70.8%) compared with
      children aged 6 to 11 years (54.2%), p = 0.23. CONCLUSION: The findings support a
      growing body of literature evidencing psychometric promise for the clinical
      utility of the NST as an FASD screening tool, though further research on possible
      age-effects is warranted. The availability of a validated clinical screening tool
      for FASD, such as the NST, would aid in accurately screening a large number of
      children and lead to a timelier diagnostic referral.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of maternal alcohol consumption in 2 regions of
      Ukraine.
PG  - 1012-9
LID - 10.1111/acer.12318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are thought to be a leading cause of
      developmental disabilities worldwide. However, data are lacking on alcohol use
      among pregnant women in many countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
      the prevalence and predictors of alcohol consumption by pregnant women in
      Ukraine. METHODS: Cross-sectional screening of pregnant women was conducted in 2 
      regions of Ukraine during the recruitment phase of an ongoing clinical study that
      is part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.
      Women attending a routine prenatal visit at 1 of 2 participating regional centers
      were asked about alcohol consumption. Quantity and frequency of alcoholic
      beverages consumed in the month around conception and in the most recent month of
      pregnancy were measured using a standard interview instrument. RESULTS: Between
      2007 and 2012, 11,909 pregnant women were screened on average in the second
      trimester of pregnancy. Of these, 92.7% reported being ever-drinkers. Among
      ever-drinkers, 54.8% reported drinking alcohol in the month around conception and
      12.9% consumed at least 3 drinks on at least 1 day in that time period. In the
      most recent month of pregnancy, 46.3% continued to report alcohol use and 9.2%
      consumed at least 3 drinks per day. Significant predictors of average number of
      drinks or heavier drinking per day in either time period in pregnancy included
      lower gravidity, being single, unmarried/living with a partner, or separated,
      lower maternal education, smoking, younger age at initiation of drinking, and
      higher score on the TWEAK screening test for harmful drinking. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings support the need for education/intervention in women of childbearing age
      in Ukraine and can help inform targeted interventions for women at risk of an
      alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The initiation of a standard screening protocol in
      pregnancy is a step in the right direction.

TI  - Differential effects of the histamine h3 receptor agonist methimepip on dentate
      granule cell excitability, paired-pulse plasticity and long-term potentiation in 
      prenatal alcohol-exposed rats.
PG  - 1902-11
LID - 10.1111/acer.12430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported that prenatal alcohol-induced deficits in
      dentate gyrus (DG) long-term potentiation (LTP) are ameliorated by the histamine 
      H3 receptor inverse agonist ABT-239. ABT-239 did not enhance LTP in control rats,
      suggesting that the possibility of a heightened H3 receptor-mediated inhibition
      of LTP in prenatal alcohol-exposed (PAE) offspring. METHODS: To further
      investigate this mechanism, we examined the effect of methimepip, a selective
      histamine H3 receptor agonist, on DG granule cell responses and LTP in saccharin 
      control and PAE rats. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0 or 5%
      ethanol solution 4 hours each day throughout gestation. Adult male offspring from
      these dams were anesthetized with urethane and electrodes implanted into the
      entorhinal cortical perforant path and the DG. RESULTS: In control offspring,
      methimepip reduced the coupling of fast excitatory postsynaptic field potentials 
      to population spikes (E-S coupling), the probability of glutamate release, as
      measured by paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and diminished DG LTP. Similar reductions in
      E-S coupling and LTP were observed in saline-treated PAE offspring. In contrast
      to the control group, methimepip did not exacerbate PAE-induced reductions in E-S
      coupling or LTP. CONCLUSIONS: While the effects of methimepip in control
      offspring were consistent with speculation of a PAE-induced enhancement of H3
      receptor-mediated inhibition of E-S coupling and LTP, the absence of an added
      effect of methimepip in PAE offspring could indicate either an inability to
      further inhibit these responses with methimepip in PAE rats or the presence of
      more complex regulatory neural interactions with in vivo recordings in PAE rats. 
      Follow-up studies of H3 receptor-mediated responses in DG slice preparations are 
      under way to provide clearer insights into the role of the H3 receptor regulation
      of excitatory transmission in PAE rats.

TI  - Seizures in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: evaluation of clinical,
      electroencephalographic, and neuroradiologic features in a pediatric case series.
PG  - e60-6
LID - 10.1111/epi.12638 [doi]
AB  - Seizures are observed with a frequency of 3-21% in children with fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD). However, clinical, neuroradiologic, and
      electroencephalography (EEG) features are poorly described. In this study, 13
      patients with FASD and epilepsy or seizures were identified retrospectively from 
      the databases of seven Italian pediatric neurology divisions. Eleven children
      were affected by epilepsy, and two had at least one documented seizure. Both
      generalized and focal seizures were observed. EEG showed diffuse or focal
      epileptic activity; two children developed electric status epilepticus during
      sleep (ESES). Structural brain anomalies, including polymicrogyria, nodular
      heterotopia, atrophy, and Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, were discovered in
      almost 50% of patients. Control of seizures was not difficult to obtain in 11
      cases; one patient showed pharmacoresistant epilepsy. EEG and clinical follow-up 
      are recommended in children with FASD and epilepsy, since severe conditions
      requiring aggressive treatment, such as in ESES, may develop. Neuroradiological
      evaluation is warranted because several types of brain anomalies could be
      associated with maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. A PowerPoint slide
      summarizing this article is available for download in the Supporting Information

TI  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the risk of orofacial clefts in
      infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 322-32
LID - 10.1111/ppe.12131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The teratogenic effects of maternal alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy include anomalies of craniofacial structures derived from the cranial
      neural crest cells. The presence of specific craniofacial anomalies contributes
      to the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Cleft lip and palate
      [orofacial clefts (OFCs)], also derived from the cranial neural crest cells, are 
      common congenital anomalies, but their relationship with prenatal alcohol
      consumption is unknown. METHODS: To evaluate the association between maternal
      consumption of alcohol during pregnancy and the occurrence of OFCs in infants, we
      conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of published studies. We examined
      the associations between any alcohol consumption, binge level drinking, and heavy
      and moderate levels of consumption vs. no or low levels of consumption. RESULTS: 
      After screening 737 publications, we identified 33 studies (23 case-control and
      10 cohort studies). There was considerable heterogeneity in individual study
      design, quality measures and study results. Findings from random effects
      meta-analyses suggest no relationship between prenatal alcohol consumption and
      the occurrence of OFCs {pooled odds ratios for any alcohol intake and binge level
      drinking respectively: cleft lip with or without cleft palate 1.00 [95%
      confidence interval (CI) 0.86, 1.16] from 18,349 participants in 13 studies, 1.04
      [95% CI 0.87, 1.24] [8763 individuals, 4 studies]; cleft palate only 1.05 [95% CI
      0.92, 1.21] [21,459 individuals, 17 studies], 0.94 [95% CI 0.74, 1.21] [7730
      participants, 4 studies]}. CONCLUSIONS: While we found no association between
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy and OFCs in infants, the influence of study 
      design, particularly in relation to alcohol exposure measurement and OFC
      ascertainment cannot be ignored.

TI  - A comparison of the prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure obtained via maternal
      self-reports versus meconium testing: a systematic literature review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 127
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-14-127 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal self-reports, used for the detection of prenatal alcohol
      exposure (PAE), may lack validity, necessitating the use of an objective
      biomarker. The detection of fatty acid ethyl esters (products of non-oxidative
      ethanol metabolism) in meconium has been established as a novel biomarker of PAE.
      The purpose of the current study was to compare the prevalence of PAE as reported
      via maternal self-reports with the results of meconium testing, and to quantify
      the disparity between these two methods. METHODS: A systematic literature search 
      for studies reporting on the prevalence of PAE, using maternal self-reports in
      combination with meconium testing, was conducted using multiple electronic
      bibliographic databases. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals
      (CI) were calculated based on eight studies, using the Mantel-Haenszel method,
      assuming a random effects model. A random effects meta-regression was performed
      to test for a difference. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of PAE as measured by
      meconium testing was 4.26 (95% CI: 1.34-13.57) times the pooled prevalence of PAE
      as measured by maternal self-reports. Large variations across the studies in
      regard to the difference between estimates obtained from maternal self-reports
      and those obtained from meconium testing were observed. CONCLUSIONS: If maternal 
      self-reports are the sole information source upon which health care professionals
      rely, a number of infants who were prenatally exposed to alcohol are not being
      recognized as such. However, further research is needed in order to validate
      existing biomarkers, as well as discover new biomarkers, for the detection of
      PAE.

      prenatally exposed to alcohol.
PG  - 4892-903
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22520 [doi]
AB  - Brain imaging studies suggest that cortical thickness decreases during childhood 
      and adolescence, in concert with underlying structural and synaptic changes
      required for cognitive maturation and regional specialization of function.
      Abnormalities of this protracted developmental process may provide key insights
      into the cognitive and behavioral deficits that emerge in individuals with fetal 
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have demonstrated cortical
      thickness differences in children and adolescents who were prenatally exposed to 
      alcohol, though all have been cross sectional, limiting conclusions about
      cortical development with age. In this study, we analyze serially collected T1
      -weighted MRI from 11 children with FASD and 21 controls, scanned twice each
      approximately 2 to 4 years apart. Mixed-models analysis of cortical thickness
      measurements revealed age-by-group interactions in cortical thinning, with FASD
      participants undergoing less developmental thinning than controls across many
      regions of the cortex, particularly in medial frontal and parietal areas. These
      results provide further longitudinal evidence in humans that prenatal alcohol
      exposure is associated with altered patterns of brain development that persist
      during childhood and adolescence.

      guidelines.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2431-14-85 [doi]
AB  - The publication of Australian fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) diagnostic
      guidelines marks an important step forward in Australia's efforts to prevent
      FASD. But do we need yet another set of FASD guidelines? At the 5th International
      FASD Conference, the ever growing number of FASD diagnostic guidelines was
      identified as a core area of concern by leaders in FASD worldwide. All agreed we 
      need to strive to adopt a single set of guidelines. It is essential that FASD
      diagnosis advance to incorporate new knowledge and technology. But to date, the
      field of FASD has seen multiple sets of guidelines published that do not address 
      the important question-How is the performance of these new guidelines superior to
      the performance of existing guidelines to warrant/justify their introduction into
      the medical literature?The Australian guidelines include FAS, PFAS and
      Neurodevelopmental Disorder-Alcohol Exposed (ND-AE). This latter group includes
      individuals with severe CNS abnormalities without the physical features of FAS.
      This is the group the 4-Digit-Code calls Static-Encephalopathy-Alcohol-Exposed
      (SE-AE). The criteria for FAS, PFAS, and ND-AE (or what the 4-Digit-Code calls
      SE-AE) are identical between the Australian and 4-Digit-Code guidelines with the 
      exception of one very small, but very consequential difference in facial criteria
      for PFAS. The 4-Digit-Code requires a Rank 3 FAS facial phenotype for PFAS (J
      Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol20(3):e416-e467, 2013); the Australian guidelines relax 
      the criteria to include the Rank 2 FAS facial phenotype. This relaxation of the
      criteria renders the facial phenotype NOT specific to prenatal alcohol exposure
      as confirmed in published empirical studies. If the facial phenotype is not
      specific to (caused only by) prenatal alcohol exposure one can no longer validly 
      call the outcome PFAS. When one makes a diagnosis of FAS (full or partial), one
      is stating explicitly that the individual has a syndrome caused by prenatal
      alcohol exposure. One is also stating explicitly that the biological mother drank
      alcohol during pregnancy and, as a result, harmed her child. These are bold
      conclusions to draw and are not without medical, ethical, and even legal
      consequences. So the question remains-Why go against the published empirical
      evidence and relax the PFAS facial criteria into the normal range?

TI  - An in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of the deep cerebellar nuclei
      in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - 1330-8
LID - 10.1111/acer.12380 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to impairment in cerebellar
      structure and function, including eyeblink conditioning. The deep cerebellar
      nuclei, which play a critical role in cerebellar-mediated learning, receive
      extensive inputs from brain stem and cerebellar cortex and provide the point of
      origin for most of the output fibers to other regions of the brain. We used in
      vivo (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine effects of prenatal
      alcohol exposure on neurochemistry in this important cerebellar region. METHODS: 
      MRS data from the deep cerebellar nuclei were acquired from 37 children with
      heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 17 non- or minimally exposed controls from
      the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS:
      Increased maternal alcohol consumption around time of conception was associated
      with lower N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the deep nuclei (r = -0.33, p <
      0.05). Higher levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to
      lower levels of the choline-containing metabolites (r = -0.37, p < 0.01),
      glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine (Cho). Alcohol consumption levels both 
      at conception (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and during pregnancy (r = 0.38, p < 0.01) were
      related to higher levels of glutamate plus glutamine (Glx). All these effects
      continued to be significant after controlling for potential confounders.
      CONCLUSIONS: The lower NAA levels seen in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure
      may reflect impaired neuronal integrity in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Our
      finding of lower Cho points to disrupted Cho metabolism of membrane
      phospholipids, reflecting altered neuropil development with potentially reduced
      content of dendrites and synapses. The alcohol-related alterations in Glx may
      suggest a disruption of the glutamate-glutamine cycling involved in glutamatergic
      excitatory neurotransmission.

TI  - Increased cut-point of the TACER-3 screen reduces false positives without losing 
      sensitivity in predicting risk alcohol drinking in pregnancy.
PG  - 1401-8
LID - 10.1111/acer.12368 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detection of in-pregnancy maternal risk alcohol drinking is an
      essential first step in preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and the
      widely used T-ACE screen was developed for that purpose. We recently reported
      that increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point from 2 to 3 doubled specificity
      of detecting risk drinking in pregnancy and identified 4-year-old children with
      neurobehavioral effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: In
      this study, the TACER-3 was further validated in another prospectively identified
      high-risk urban cohort. Women were categorized as follows: (i) Not At-Risk Group 
      (negative on T-ACE and TACER-3); (ii) At-Risk Group (positive on T-ACE and
      TACER-3); and (iii) Change Risk Group (positive on T-ACE but negative on
      TACER-3). RESULTS: The TACER-3 total score cut-point of 3 yielded fewer "false
      positives" than the T-ACE cut-point of 2. Based on relative risk scores, women in
      the TACER-3-positive At-Risk Group were more likely to drink alcohol during
      pregnancy than women in the Change Risk Group. In contrast, women in the Not
      At-Risk Group were largely not different in their drinking from women in the
      Change Risk Group. The largest increases in relative risk of the At-Risk Group
      compared to the Change Risk Group were for the amount of drinking per day across 
      pregnancy (RR = 11.4) and for the amount of drinking per drinking day at the
      first prenatal visit (RR = 12.7). For both of these measures, the relative risk
      of at-risk alcohol consumption in the At-Risk Group was over >10 times that of
      the Change Risk Group. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the TACER-3 was more effective at
      selectively identifying women drinking at fetal risk levels than the original
      T-ACE. The TACER-3 allows for more efficient use of healthcare provider time in
      directing targeted clinical interventions with pregnant women identified as
      drinking at fetal risk levels.

TI  - Cortical morphology in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder.
PG  - 41-50
LID - 10.1002/brb3.191 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is well established that individuals exposed to alcohol in utero
      have reduced cortical grey matter volumes. However, the candidate determinants of
      these reductions, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), have not been
      investigated exclusively in alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND),
      the most prevalent fetal alcohol spectrum disorder subgroup that lacks the
      characteristic facial dysmorphology. METHODS: T1-weighted magnetic resonance
      imaging scans were obtained from 88 participants (8-16 years), 36 diagnosed with 
      ARND and 52 typically developing controls. Scans were submitted to the CIVET
      pipeline (version 1.1.10). Deformable models were used to construct the inner
      white matter surfaces and pial surfaces from which CT and SA measures were
      derived. Group differences in cortical volume, CT, and SA were computed using a
      general linear model covaried for age, sex, and handedness. RESULTS: Global
      cortical volume reductions in ARND did not reflect CT, which did not differ
      between groups. Instead, volume decreases were consistent with global SA
      reductions in bilateral frontal and temporal as well as right occipital regions. 
      Local reductions in SA were observed in the right superior temporal gyrus and the
      right occipital-temporal region. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that in ARND,
      prenatal alcohol exposure perturbs global SA to a greater degree than CT,
      particularly in the right temporal lobe.

TI  - Drinking before and after pregnancy recognition among South African women: the
      moderating role of traumatic experiences.
PG  - 97
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-14-97 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: South Africa has one of the world's highest rates of fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder (FASD) and interpersonal trauma. These co-occurring public
      health problems raise the need to understand alcohol consumption among
      trauma-exposed pregnant women in this setting. Since a known predictor of
      drinking during pregnancy is drinking behavior before pregnancy, this study
      explored the relationship between women's drinking levels before and after
      pregnancy recognition, and whether traumatic experiences - childhood abuse or
      recent intimate partner violence (IPV) - moderated this relationship. METHODS:
      Women with incident pregnancies (N = 66) were identified from a longitudinal
      cohort of 560 female drinkers in a township of Cape Town, South Africa.
      Participants were included if they reported no pregnancy at one assessment and
      then reported pregnancy four months later at the next assessment. Alcohol use was
      measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and traumatic 
      experiences of childhood abuse and recent IPV were also assessed. Hierarchical
      linear regressions controlling for race and age examined childhood abuse and
      recent IPV as moderators of the effect of pre-pregnancy recognition drinking on
      post-pregnancy recognition AUDIT scores. RESULTS: Following pregnancy
      recognition, 73% of women reported drinking at hazardous levels (AUDIT >/= 8).
      Sixty-four percent reported early and/or recent exposure to trauma. While
      drinking levels before pregnancy significantly predicted drinking levels after
      pregnancy recognition, t(64) = 3.50, p < .01, this relationship was moderated by 
      experiences of childhood abuse, B = -.577, t(60) = -2.58, p = .01, and recent
      IPV, B = -.477, t(60) = -2.16, p = .04. Pregnant women without traumatic
      experiences reported drinking at levels consistent with levels before pregnancy
      recognition. However, women with traumatic experiences tended to report elevated 
      AUDIT scores following pregnancy recognition, even if low-risk drinkers
      previously. CONCLUSION: This study explored how female drinkers in South Africa
      may differentially modulate their drinking patterns upon pregnancy recognition,
      depending on trauma history. Our results suggest that women with traumatic
      experiences are more likely to exhibit risky alcohol consumption when they become
      pregnant, regardless of prior risk. These findings illuminate the relevance of
      trauma-informed efforts to reduce FASD in South Africa.

TI  - Playfulness and prenatal alcohol exposure: a comparative study.
PG  - 259-67
LID - 10.1111/1440-1630.12118 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: South Africa carries a high burden of alcohol abuse. The effects 
      of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy are most pronounced in poor,
      rural communities. Earlier research suggests that children with prenatal alcohol 
      exposure have poor social behaviour; however, to date, no research has
      investigated their playfulness. This study investigated the differences in
      playfulness of children with and without prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS:
      Grade one learners with a positive history of prenatal alcohol exposure (n = 15) 
      and a reference group without a positive history of prenatal alcohol exposure (n 
      = 15) were filmed engaging in free play at their schools. The Test of Playfulness
      was used to measure playfulness from recordings. Data were subjected to Rasch
      analysis to calculate interval level measure scores for each participant. The
      overall measure scores and individual Test of Playfulness social items were
      subjected to paired samples t-tests to calculate if significant differences
      existed between the groups. RESULTS: Children with prenatal alcohol exposure had 
      a significantly lower mean overall playfulness score than the reference group (t 
      = -2.51; d.f. = 28; P = 0.02). Children with prenatal alcohol exposure also
      scored significantly lower than the reference group on 5 of the 12 Test of
      Playfulness items related to social play. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests
      that children with prenatal alcohol exposure are more likely to experience poorer
      overall quality of play, with particular deficits in social play. Considering
      play is a child's primary occupation, this finding becomes pertinent for
      occupational therapy practice, particularly in post-apartheid South Africa, where
      high prenatal alcohol exposure prevalence rates are couched within persistent
      socio-economic inequalities.

AB  - Clinical research and practice support a multi-method approach to validating
      behavioral problems in children. We examined whether parent-reported symptoms of 
      hyperactivity and inattention (using the Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating
      Scale) were substantiated by objective laboratory measures [hyperactivity
      measured by wrist-worn actigraphy (ACT) and inattention assessed using a
      20-minute continuous performance task (CPT)] in three age- and
      demographically-matched groups of school-age children: children with prenatal
      alcohol exposure (AE), non-exposed children with idiopathic ADHD (ADHD), and
      controls (CON). Results indicated that the clinical groups (AE, ADHD) had
      significantly higher parent-reported levels for both domains compared to the CON 
      group, and did not differ from each other. On the laboratory measures, the
      clinical groups were more inattentive than controls on the CPT, but did not
      differ from each other. In contrast, the ADHD group had higher objective activity
      on the ACT than AE and CON, which did not differ from each other. Thus,
      laboratory measures differentially validated parent reports in a group-dependent 
      manner. Actigraphy substantiated parent-reported hyperactivity for children in
      the ADHD group but not for children in the AE group, while the CPT validated
      parent-reported inattention for both clinical groups. Although the majority of
      children in the AE group met the criteria for ADHD, objective activity levels
      were not different from controls, indicating that hyperactivity may be a less
      prominent feature in the AE group. Thus, while there is considerable overlap
      between the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD, differences in
      behavioral profiles may be clinically useful in differential diagnosis. Further, 
      these data indicate that objective measures should be used to validate parent
      reports.

AB  - Despite the availability of clinical tools and evidence-based screening
      recommendations, there has been little discussion regarding screening of prenatal
      alcohol exposure in community-based settings, including adoption and
      implementation. This study's aim is to evaluate and validate--through surveys and
      focus groups--obstacles and challenges that shape efficacious implementation of
      the BAI at two Illinois health departments. Results suggest that BAI
      implementation is facilitated by staff perceptions of its benefits, readiness to 
      implement the intervention, and organizational support for it. Limitations of the
      management information system, ambiguous screening questions, and high case-loads
      present barriers to effective BAI implementation.

TI  - Canadian Children and Youth in Care: The Cost of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 83-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure has been reported
      among children in care and thus, the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
      (FASD) in this population is high. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study
      was to estimate the number of children (0-18 years) in care with FASD and to
      determine the associated cost by age group, gender, and province/territory in
      Canada in 2011. METHODS: The prevalence of children in care by province/territory
      was obtained from the Canadian Child Welfare Research Portal, and the number of
      children in care with FASD for each province/territory was estimated from
      available epidemiological studies. In order to calculate the total cost per
      province/territory, the cost per individual per day, by age group, was applied to
      the respective number of children in care with FASD. RESULTS: The estimated
      number of children in care with FASD ranged from 2,225 to 7,620, with an annual
      cost of care ranging from $57.9 to $198.3 million Canadian dollars (CND). The
      highest overall cost ($29.5 to $101.1 million CND) was for 11-15 year-olds.
      CONCLUSION: The study findings can be used to demonstrate the substantial
      economic burden that FASD places on the child welfare system. Attention towards
      the needs of this population and prevention efforts to reduce FASD incidence in
      Canada, and other countries are urgently needed.

TI  - Messages that increase women's intentions to abstain from alcohol during
      pregnancy: results from quantitative testing of advertising concepts.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-30 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Public awareness-raising campaigns targeting alcohol use during
      pregnancy are an important part of preventing prenatal alcohol exposure and Fetal
      Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Despite this, there is little evidence on what
      specific elements contribute to campaign message effectiveness. This research
      evaluated three different advertising concepts addressing alcohol and pregnancy: 
      a threat appeal, a positive appeal promoting a self-efficacy message, and a
      concept that combined the two appeals. The primary aim was to determine the
      effectiveness of these concepts in increasing women's intentions to abstain from 
      alcohol during pregnancy. METHODS: Women of childbearing age and pregnant women
      residing in Perth, Western Australia participated in a computer-based
      questionnaire where they viewed either a control or one of the three experimental
      concepts. Following exposure, participants' intentions to abstain from and reduce
      alcohol intake during pregnancy were measured. Other measures assessed included
      perceived main message, message diagnostics, and potential to promote defensive
      responses or unintended consequences. RESULTS: The concepts containing a threat
      appeal were significantly more effective at increasing women's intentions to
      abstain from alcohol during pregnancy than the self-efficacy message and the
      control. The concept that combined threat and self-efficacy is recommended for
      development as part of a mass-media campaign as it has good persuasive potential,
      provides a balance of positive and negative emotional responses, and is unlikely 
      to result in defensive or unintended consequences. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      provides important insights into the components that enhance the persuasiveness
      and effectiveness of messages aimed at preventing prenatal alcohol exposure. The 
      recommended concept has good potential for use in a future campaign aimed at
      promoting women's intentions to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy.

AB  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in birth defects known as fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders. This study examined whether 1-h training sessions on 
      alcohol screening, brief intervention, diagnoses, and treatment of fetal alcohol 
      spectrum disorders could increase practical knowledge and confidence in nurses
      and student nurses. Data were collected from 420 nurses (n = 95) and student
      nurses (n = 325) in the southeastern United States, from 2009 to 2011. Pre- and
      post-test data were analyzed using chi-square tests and t-tests. The
      post-training response rate was 84%. Nurses were more likely to know what
      constitutes binge drinking, facial abnormalities associated with fetal alcohol
      syndrome, and criteria for diagnosis. Nurses were also more confident in
      educating about effects of prenatal alcohol use, identifying fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders and utilizing resources. Training materials may need to be
      improved and/or longer training programs developed for student nurses, and
      nursing school programs should place more emphasis on educating and preparing
      student nurses regarding this topic area.

      subjects with the co-occurrence of FASD and cancer. We included an additional
      case from the author's institution. Neuroblastomas comprised 6 of the 13 (46%)
      case reports, yet neuroblastomas comprise only about 10% of childhood cancers (z 
      = 4.1; P < 0.001). Other than rhabdomyosarcoma, no other cancer was reported more
      than once. Few cases of childhood cancer associated with FASD were identified
      likely due to under ascertainment of FASD.

AB  - Alcohol dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of alcohol.
      Expression of three alleles at the ADH1B locus results in enzymes that differ in 
      turnover rate and affinity for alcohol. The ADH1B*3 allele, which appears to be
      unique to individuals of African descent, is associated with more rapid alcohol
      metabolism than the more prevalent ADH1B*1 allele. It has been previously
      demonstrated that the presence of at least one maternal ADH1B*3 allele confers a 
      protective effect against alcohol teratogenicity in infants and children. This
      study was conducted to determine whether the presence of the ADH1B*3 allele in
      the mother or child continues to be protective in alcohol-exposed individuals
      during adolescence. 186 adolescents and 167 mothers participating in a 14-year
      follow-up of the Detroit Longitudinal Cohort were genotyped for ADH1B alleles.
      Behavioral reports were obtained from classroom teachers. Frequencies of the
      ADH1B*3 allele were 17.6% in the mothers and 21.0% in the adolescents, which are 
      consistent with the 15-20% expected for African Americans. Prenatal alcohol
      exposure was associated with increased attention problems and externalizing
      behaviors in adolescents born to mothers with two ADH1B*1 alleles but not in
      those whose mothers had at least one ADH1B*3 allele. A similar pattern was seen
      in relation to the presence or absence of an ADH1B*3 allele in the adolescent,
      which may have reflected the presence/absence of the maternal variant. This study
      is the first to demonstrate that the protective effects of the maternal ADH1B*3
      allele continue to be evident during adolescence. These persistent individual
      differences in vulnerability of offspring to the behavioral effects of fetal
      alcohol exposure are likely attributable to more rapid metabolism of alcohol that
      the ADH1B*3 variant confers on the mother, leading to a reduction of the peak
      blood alcohol concentration to which the fetus is exposed during each drinking
      episode.

      this dataset were aged 5-17 years and included those diagnosed with an FASD
      (n=72), those with PAE but no clinical FASD diagnosis (n=21), and typically
      developing controls (n=139). Participants completed a neurobehavioral test
      battery, which included the NEPSY-II subtests of auditory attention, response
      set, and inhibition. Each participant completed a series of saccadic eye movement
      tasks, which included the antisaccade and memory-guided tasks. Both the FASD and 
      the PAE groups performed worse than controls on the subtest measures of attention
      and inhibition. Compared with controls, the FASD group made more errors on the
      antisaccade and memory-guided tasks. Among the combined FASD/PAE group,
      inhibition and switching errors were negatively correlated with direction errors 
      on the antisaccade task but not on the memory-guided task. There were no
      significant correlations in the control group. These data suggests that response 
      inhibition deficits in children with FASD/PAE are associated with difficulty
      controlling saccadic eye movements which may point to overlapping brain regions
      damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. The results of this study demonstrate that 
      eye movement control tasks directly relate to outcome measures obtained with
      psychometric tests that are used during FASD diagnosis, and may therefore help
      with early identification of children who would benefit from a multidisciplinary 
      diagnostic assessment.

TI  - Inappropriate feeding behaviors and dietary intakes in children with fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorder or probable prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 871-8
LID - 10.1111/acer.12284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is a leading cause of significant
      neurobehavioral and neurocognitive deficits. Its potential consequences for
      eating behaviors, nutritional status, and other nutritional issues in childhood
      have received little attention. METHODS: Nineteen children (11 boys, 8 girls) of 
      mean age 9.6 years, referred for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) screening
      and assessment, were analyzed with physical exams and caregiver questionnaires to
      identify possible abnormalities in food and eating behaviors. Fourteen children
      contributed 24-hour diet recalls and were assessed for nutritional status.
      RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of participants were diagnosed with FASD and 63.2% 
      had confirmed PAE. Fifty percent of girls were overweight or obese, whereas 37%
      of boys had reduced stature, weight, or body mass index for their age. Recurring 
      feeding problems included constant snacking (36.8%), lack of satiety (26.3%), and
      picky eating/poor appetite (31.6%). None had oral feeding problems. Constipation 
      was common (26.3%). Macronutrient intakes were largely normal, but sugar
      consumption was excessive (140 to 190% of recommendations) in 57% of subjects.
      Vitamin A intake exceeded the upper limit for 64% of participants, whereas >/=50%
      had intakes <80% of recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for choline, vitamin E,
      potassium, beta-carotene, and essential fatty acids; 100% had vitamin D intakes
      <80% of the RDA. CONCLUSIONS: PAE may be associated with altered acquisition and 
      distribution of body mass with increasing age. Disordered eating was common. The 
      increased feeding behaviors surrounding lack of satiety suggest that
      self-regulation may be altered. Constipation could reflect low dietary fiber or
      altered gastrointestinal function. These exploratory data suggest that children
      with PAE may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies, which are influenced by
      inappropriate food preferences, disordered eating patterns, medication use, and
      the stressful dynamics surrounding food preparation and mealtime.

TI  - What research is being done on prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders in the Russian research community?
PG  - 84-95
LID - 10.1093/alcalc/agt156 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Although Russia has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption and
      alcohol-attributable burden of disease, little is known about the existing
      research on prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders 
      (FASDs) in this country. The objective of this study was to locate and review
      published and unpublished studies related to any aspect of PAE and FASD conducted
      in or using study populations from Russia. METHODS: A systematic literature
      search was conducted in multiple English and Russian electronic bibliographic
      databases. In addition, a manual search was conducted in several major libraries 
      in Moscow. RESULTS: The search revealed a small pool of existing research studies
      related to PAE and/or FASD in Russia (126: 22 in English and 104 in Russian).
      Existing epidemiological data indicate a high prevalence of PAE and FASD, which
      underlines the strong negative impact that alcohol has on mortality, morbidity
      and disability in Russia. High levels of alcohol consumption by women of
      childbearing age, low levels of contraception use, and low levels of knowledge by
      health and other professionals regarding the harmful effects of PAE put this
      country at great risk of further alcohol-affected pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS:
      Alcohol preventive measures in Russia warrant immediate attention. More research 
      focused on alcohol prevention and policy is needed in order to reduce
      alcohol-related harm, especially in the field of FASD.

TI  - Neuropsychological deficits associated with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure are
      not exacerbated by ADHD.
PG  - 713-24
LID - 10.1037/a0033994 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychological functioning of individuals with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or heavy prenatal alcohol
      exposure has been well documented independently. This study examined the
      interaction between both factors on cognitive performance in children. METHOD: As
      part of a multisite study, 344 children (8-16 y, M = 12.28, SD = 2.52) completed 
      a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Four subject groups were tested:
      children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) and ADHD (AE+, n 
      = 90), alcohol-exposed without ADHD, (AE-, n = 38), nonexposed with ADHD (ADHD, n
      = 80), and nonexposed without ADHD (CON, n = 136). RESULTS: Separate 2(AE) x
      2(ADHD) MANCOVAs revealed significant main and interactive effects of ADHD and AE
      on overall WISC-IV, D-KEFS, and CANTAB performance. Individual ANOVAs revealed
      significant interactions on 2 WISC-IV indices [Verbal Comprehension (VCI),
      Perceptual Reasoning (PRI)], and four D-KEFS and CANTAB subtests [Design Fluency,
      Verbal Fluency, Trail Making, Spatial Working Memory]. Follow-up analyses
      demonstrated no difference between AE+ and AE- groups on these measures. The
      combined AE+/- group demonstrated more severe impairment than the ADHD group on
      VCI and PRI, but there were no other differences between clinical groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results support a combined AE+/- group for neuropsychological 
      research and indicate that, in some cases, the neuropsychological effects seen in
      ADHD are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. The effects of alcohol exposure on
      verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning were greater than those related to 
      having ADHD without alcohol exposure, although both conditions independently
      resulted in cognitive impairment compared to controls. Clinically, these findings
      demonstrate task-dependent patterns of impairment across clinical disorders.

PG  - e201-6
AB  - Alcohol (ethanol) consumption in pregnancy is the etiology of fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder (FASD), a leading cause of congenital disability worldwide.
      Hence, any attempt to prevent or manage FASD must start from comprehensive
      understanding of alcohol consumption by women in general, and by women of
      reproductive years in particular. This review presents and synthesizes studies
      conducted worldwide on alcohol consumption by pregnant women, risk factors
      associated with gestational drinking, as well as doses and definitions of
      drinking behaviours.

TI  - An examination of the social determinants of health as factors related to health,
      healing and prevention of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder in a northern
      context--the Brightening Our Home Fires Project, Northwest Territories, Canada.
LID - 10.3402/ijch.v72i0.21140 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Brightening Our Home Fires (BOHF) project was conceptualized as an
      exploratory project to examine the issue of the prevention of foetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder (FASD) from a women's health perspective in the Northwest
      Territories (NT). While dominant discourse suggests that FASD is preventable by
      abstention from alcohol during pregnancy, a broader perspective would indicate
      that alcohol and pregnancy is a far more complex issue, that is, bound in
      location, economics, social and cultural views of health. This project was
      prevention focused and a social determinant of health (SDH) perspective informed 
      this research. METHODS: The BOHF project was a qualitative research project using
      a participatory action research framework to examine women's health and healing
      in the north. The methodology utilized was Photovoice. Women were provided
      training in digital photography and given cameras to use and keep. The primary
      research question utilized was: What does health and healing look like for you in
      your community? Women described their photos, individually or in groups around
      this central topic. This research was FASD informed, and women participants were 
      aware this was an FASD prevention funded project whose approach focused on a
      broader context of health and lived experience. RESULTS: This project drew 30
      participants from: Yellowknife, Lutsel 'ke, Behchoko and Ulukhaktok. These four
      different communities across the NT represented Dene and Inuit culture. The
      qualitative data analysis offered themes of importance to women's health in the
      north including: land and tradition; housing; poverty; food; family; health,
      mental health and trauma, and travel. Photovoice provides a non-threatening way
      to engage in dialogue on complex health and social issues.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure among Alaska Native/American Indian infants.
LID - 10.3402/ijch.v72i0.20973 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicate a decline in rates of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome 
      (FAS) among Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) infants. Nevertheless,
      AN/AI infants remain disproportionately impacted by the effects of prenatal
      alcohol exposure. METHODS: AN/AI pregnant women in their 3rd trimester completed 
      a questionnaire on demographic data and the amount and frequency of their alcohol
      consumption in the month prior to conception and during pregnancy. Differences
      across demographics and trimesters were tested with the Chi-square, Fisher's
      exact or McNemar's test as appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 125 participants, 56% (n 
      = 71) reported no alcohol consumption in the 1st through 3rd trimesters of
      pregnancy; 30% (n = 38) of the 125 participants also reported no alcohol
      consumption in the month before pregnancy. Of the 43% (n = 54) who reported
      consuming alcohol during pregnancy (1st, 2nd and/or 3rd trimester), most (35%)
      reported alcohol use only in the 1st trimester. Binge drinking in the 1st or 2nd 
      trimester was reported amongst 20% (n = 25) of participants with an additional
      18% (n = 29) reporting binge drinking in the month prior to pregnancy. Women who 
      reported pre-conception binge drinking were significantly more likely to report
      binge drinking during their 1st trimester (p < 0.0001) and 2nd trimester (p <
      0.0001). A history of tobacco use (p = 0.0403) and cigarette smoking during
      pregnancy (p < 0.0001) were also associated with binge drinking during pregnancy.
      CONCLUSION: Among study participants, reported use of alcohol was primarily
      limited to pre-conception and the 1st trimester, with a dramatic decrease in the 
      2nd and 3rd trimesters. Prevention programmes, such as the Alaska FAS Prevention 
      Project, may have contributed to observed decreases in the 2nd and 3rd
      trimesters. Additional study and focus on pre-conception, the 1st trimester and
      binge drinking, as well as tobacco use might augment Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorder prevention efforts.

TI  - Reduced expression of brain cannabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1) is coupled with an

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to result in fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders, a continuum of physiological, behavioural, and cognitive
      phenotypes that include increased risk for anxiety and learning-associated
      disorders. Prenatal alcohol exposure results in life-long disorders that may
      manifest in part through the induction of long-term gene expression changes,
      potentially maintained through epigenetic mechanisms. FINDINGS: Here we report a 
      decrease in the expression of Canabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1) and an increase in the
      expression of the regulatory microRNA miR-26b in the brains of adult mice exposed
      to ethanol during neurodevelopment. Furthermore, we show that miR-26b has
      significant complementarity to the 3'-UTR of the Cnr1 transcript, giving it the
      potential to bind and reduce the level of Cnr1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings elucidate a mechanism through which some genes show long-term altered
      expression following prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to persistent alterations
      to cognitive function and behavioural phenotypes observed in fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders.

TI  - Dimensions of parental alcohol use/problems and offspring temperament,
      externalizing behaviors, and alcohol use/problems.
PG  - 2118-27
LID - 10.1111/acer.12196 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption (AC) and alcohol problems (AP) are complex
      traits. How many factors reflecting parental AC and AP are present in the large
      prospectively followed Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort?
      Would these factors be uniquely associated with various temperamental and
      alcohol-related outcomes in the children? METHODS: We factor-analyzed multiple
      items reflecting maternal and paternal AC and AP measured over a 12-year period
      from before the birth of the child (n = 14,093 families). We examined, by linear 
      regression controlling for socioeconomic status, the relationship between scales 
      derived from these factors and offspring early childhood temperament,
      externalizing traits, and adolescent AC and AP (ns ranging from 9,732 to 3,454). 
      RESULTS: We identified 5 coherent factors: typical maternal AC, maternal AC
      during pregnancy, maternal AP, paternal AC, and paternal AP. In univariate
      analyses, maternal and paternal AC and AP were modestly and significantly
      associated with low shyness, sociability, hyperactivity, and conduct problems in 
      childhood and early adolescence; delinquent behavior at age 15; and AC and AP at 
      ages 15 and 18. AC and AP at age 18 were more strongly predicted by parental
      factors than at age 15. Maternal AC during pregnancy uniquely predicted
      externalizing traits at ages 4, 13, and 15. CONCLUSIONS: Parental AC and AP are
      complex multidimensional traits that differ in their association with a range of 
      relevant measures in their children. Controlling for background AC and AP,
      self-reported levels of maternal AC during pregnancy uniquely predicted
      externalizing behaviors in childhood and adolescence.

AB  - Brief, effective interventions are needed to reduce the risk of an
      alcohol-exposed pregnancy in women who drink and do not use effective
      contraception. The Healthy Choices study compared telephone and in-person
      administration of a brief intervention. In addition to indicators of alcohol use 
      and effective contraception, compliance with the intervention was examined. Women
      between the ages of 18 and 44 who were drinking above recommended levels and not 
      using effective contraception were randomly assigned to either a telephone (n=68)
      or in-person (n=63) brief (two sessions) intervention. Overall, participants
      showed small but significant reductions in alcohol use and larger increases in
      effective use of contraception. Risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancy was thus
      significantly reduced, largely due to improved contraception with minor
      reductions in alcohol use. There was no significant difference in success of the 
      intervention between the two conditions (telephone versus in-person). These
      findings suggest telephone-based brief intervention may be equally successful and
      cost-effective in reducing the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy and thus
      fetal alcohol syndrome.

TI  - Early fetal binge alcohol exposure predicts high behavioral symptom scores in
      5.5-year-old children.
PG  - 1954-62
LID - 10.1111/acer.12182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal binge alcohol exposure has been associated with neurobehavioral
      and cognitive symptoms. This study explored whether binge drinking mainly before 
      recognition of pregnancy predicted high symptom scores on the Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in 5.5-year-old children. METHODS: In a
      population-based, longitudinal study representative of pregnant women in Oslo,
      Norway, questionnaires were answered at 17 and 30 weeks of pregnancy, 6 months
      after term, and at child age 5.5 years (n = 1,116, constituting 66% of the
      original cohort). Logistic regression analyses identified factors predicting high
      SDQ scores, and multiple regression analyses identified direct effects on the SDQ
      Total. RESULTS: Binge exposure (>/=5 standard units per occasion [SUpo]) during
      pregnancy week 0 to 6, that is, 0 to 4 weeks after conception, predicted scores
      in the Abnormal and Borderline range on the SDQ in 5.5-year-olds, after adjusting
      for other confounding variables. Very early binge exposure less often than once a
      week predicted high symptom scores on the SDQ Total (p = 0.05) and
      Hyperactivity/Inattention (significant), while exposure at least once a week
      demonstrated a 3- to 5-fold significant increase in high symptom scores on Total,
      Emotional, and Conduct problems. Reporting >/=8 SUpo had stronger predictive
      power than reporting 5 to 7 SUpo. The results were not explained by participants 
      reporting major lifetime depression. Other predictive factors, although weaker,
      were maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety during the child's infancy. High
      education (mother and father), high income (maternal partner), higher child birth
      weight, and child female sex reduced the likelihood of high SDQ symptom scores.
      Path analysis demonstrated early binge exposure to have a direct effect on the
      SDQ Total score. CONCLUSIONS: Binge drinking up to 4 weeks after conception had a
      strong and direct predictive effect on SDQ symptom scores in 5.5-year-olds. These
      results strongly support the advice to avoid binge drinking when planning
      pregnancy.

TI  - Evaluating the psycholegal abilities of young offenders with fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder.
PG  - 10-22
LID - 10.1037/lhb0000037 [doi]
AB  - Individuals with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) experience
      a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral deficits thought to interfere with
      their ability to competently navigate the arrest, interrogation, and trial
      process. This study examined the psycholegal abilities of young offenders with
      FASD, including their understanding and appreciation of Miranda rights, and
      adjudication capacities (factual knowledge of criminal procedure, appreciation of
      the nature and object of the proceedings, ability to participate in a defense and
      communicate with counsel). Two groups of young offenders (50 with FASD and 50
      without prenatal alcohol exposure) completed Grisso's Instruments for Assessing
      Understanding and Appreciation of Miranda rights and the Fitness Interview
      Test-Revised to assess overall rates of impairment in youth with FASD, as well as
      differences between the groups. Potentially important predictors of psycholegal
      abilities were also evaluated. Results indicated the majority of young offenders 
      with FASD (90%) showed impairment in at least one psycholegal ability, and rates 
      of impairment were significantly higher than the comparison group. However,
      considerable within-group variability was observed. IQ and reading comprehension 
      emerged as robust predictors of participants' psycholegal abilities, while the
      FASD diagnosis differentiated participants' scores on the FIT-R. These findings
      underscore the importance of individualized and comprehensive forensic
      assessments of psycholegal abilities in this population when warranted.
      Additional system level strains for this population are discussed, including
      problems in approaching competency remediation, and the potentially growing need 
      for accommodation and forensic assessments in the face of limited financial and
      professional resources in legal settings.

TI  - Hospital admissions for alcohol use disorders before, during, and after
      pregnancy: a study based on linked population data in new South Wales, Australia.
PG  - 1706-12

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorders (AUD) during pregnancy can have profound
      lifelong effects on the baby, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). 
      Hospital admission for AUD during pregnancy provides an opportunity for
      intervention. Characterization of women along the AUD spectrum during pregnancy
      aids the development of prevention strategies, policy, and clinical management
      guidelines aimed at this population. This study describes the hospital admission 
      levels for AUD between the sixth month before pregnancy and the first year after 
      birth and explores risk factors associated with the hospital admissions. METHODS:
      This study was based on linked population data between 2002 and 2005 using the
      New South Wales (NSW) Midwives Data Collection (MDC) and the NSW Admitted
      Patients Data Collection (APDC), Australia. The study subjects included
      primiparous mothers who were admitted to hospital in the period from the sixth
      month before pregnancy to 1 year after birth with at least 1 of the following
      diagnoses (ICD-10-AM): mental and behavioral disorders due to the use of alcohol 
      (MBDA) (F10.0-10.9); toxic effects of alcohol (T51.0-51.9); maternal care for
      suspected damage to fetus from alcohol (O35.4); or alcohol rehabilitation
      (Z50.2). RESULTS: A total of 175 new mothers had 287 hospital admissions with the
      principal or stay AUD diagnoses during the study period in NSW. Of the 287
      admissions, 181 admissions (63.07%) were reported for an alcohol-related disorder
      as the principal diagnosis. The hospital admission rate for AUD was 1.76/1,000
      person-years (PY) (95% CI: 1.45 to 2.07) during the 6 months prepregnancy. The
      rate decreased to 0.49/1,000 PY (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.63) during pregnancy and to
      0.82/1,000 PY (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.97) in the first year after birth. Women who
      smoked during pregnancy, lived in a remote area and were younger than 25 years,
      were more likely to be admitted to hospital with AUD diagnoses. Women in the
      middle disadvantaged quintile and born in other countries were less likely to be 
      admitted to hospital with AUD diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admission for AUD 
      decreased significantly in pregnancy and the first year postpartum compared to
      the prepregnancy period.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an analysis of multiple predictors of cognitive and
      behavioral traits for children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs).
      METHOD: Multivariate correlation techniques were used with maternal and child
      data from epidemiologic studies in a community in South Africa. Data on 561
      first-grade children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (PFAS), and
      not FASD and their mothers were analyzed by grouping 19 maternal variables into
      categories (physical, demographic, childbearing, and drinking) and used in
      structural equation models (SEMs) to assess correlates of child intelligence
      (verbal and nonverbal) and behavior. RESULTS: A first SEM using only 7 maternal
      alcohol use variables to predict cognitive/behavioral traits was statistically
      significant (B = 3.10, p < .05) but explained only 17.3% of the variance. The
      second model incorporated multiple maternal variables and was statistically
      significant explaining 55.3% of the variance. Significantly correlated with low
      intelligence and problem behavior were demographic (B = 3.83, p < .05) (low
      maternal education, low socioeconomic status [SES], and rural residence) and
      maternal physical characteristics (B = 2.70, p < .05) (short stature, small head 
      circumference, and low weight). Childbearing history and alcohol use composites
      were not statistically significant in the final complex model and were
      overpowered by SES and maternal physical traits. CONCLUSIONS: Although other
      analytic techniques have amply demonstrated the negative effects of maternal
      drinking on intelligence and behavior, this highly controlled analysis of
      multiple maternal influences reveals that maternal demographics and physical
      traits make a significant enabling or disabling contribution to child functioning
      in FASD.

TI  - CHOICES: an integrated behavioral intervention to prevent alcohol-exposed
      pregnancies among high-risk women in community settings.
PG  - 224-33
LID - 10.1080/19371918.2013.759011 [doi]
AB  - CHOICES is an integrated behavioral intervention for prevention of prenatal
      alcohol exposure in women at high risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. The
      intervention uses motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral strategies, 
      and targets adoption of effective contraception and reduction of alcohol use. The
      CHOICES intervention includes four manual-guided counseling sessions delivered by
      behavioral health counselors and one contraceptive session with a family planning
      clinician. CHOICES's efficacy has been established through a series of randomized
      controlled trials in settings including primary care, university hospital-based
      obstetrical/gynecology practices, urban jails, substance abuse treatment
      settings, and a media-recruited sample in three large cities. This article
      describes the CHOICES line of research including the epidemiology, feasibility,
      and efficacy studies. It also details the CHOICES intervention and the components
      of each session. In addition, the authors describe current studies testing
      modifications of the CHOICES intervention, the dissemination efforts to date, and
      implications for social work practice.

LID - S0741-8329(13)00045-1 [pii]
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to behavioral and cognitive impairments across
      multiple domains. Many of the brain regions impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure
      are also linked with olfactory processing, and odor identification deficits have 
      been documented in certain neurological disorders associated with these brain
      regions. As odor identification following prenatal alcohol exposure is not well
      studied, we compared odor identification in children with prenatal exposure to
      alcohol (AE) to typically developing controls (CON) (N = 16/group). It was
      hypothesized that children in the AE group would perform more poorly than
      children in the CON group on the San Diego Odor Identification Test, an
      identification test of 8 common household odorants. Children exposed to alcohol
      during prenatal development were significantly impaired in olfactory
      identification (M = 5.95, SE = 0.37) compared to typically developing controls (M
      = 7.24, SE = 0.37). These findings confirmed the hypothesis that prenatal
      exposure to alcohol is associated with odor identification deficits, and suggest 
      that further research is warranted to identify the mechanisms underlying these
      deficits, the integrity of brain areas that are involved, and to determine
      whether olfactory performance might contribute to better identification of
      children at risk for behavioral and cognitive deficits.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure in the Republic of the Congo: prevalence and screening 
      strategies.
PG  - 489-96
LID - 10.1002/bdra.23127 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence of prenatal alcohol use in Brazzaville, Congo 
      and to evaluate a prenatal screening tool for use in this population. METHODS: A 
      prospective population screening program of 3099 women at 10 prenatal care
      clinics in Brazzaville, Congo using the 1-Question screen. To validate the
      1-Question screen in this population we screened 764 of these women again using
      the T-ACE as a gold standard for comparison study. The study outcomes were as
      follows: prevalence of self-reported prenatal alcohol use in Brazzaville using
      the 1-Question screen, estimation of number of drinking days, drinks per drinking
      day, most drinks on any one occasion. We also estimated the epidemiologic
      performance criteria for the 1-Question screen. RESULTS: The 3099 women screened 
      were classified as follows: no risk 77% (n=2,384); at risk 3.7% (n=115); and as
      high risk 19.3% (n=600). Of the women reporting drinking during pregnancy, 87.4% 
      reported drinking 4 or more drinks on any occasion. The agreement for detection
      of alcohol use during pregnancy by the 1-Question Screen and a positive T-ACE
      score was 94.7%. CONCLUSIONS: 23.3% of women attending prenatal care in
      Brazzaville reported alcohol use during pregnancy and 83% of them continued to
      drink after recognition of pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol exposure should be the
      focus of efforts to improve identification of alcohol use prior to and during
      pregnancy to improve maternal and child health. Birth Defects Research (Part A)

TI  - Reducing fetal alcohol exposure in the United States.
PG  - 367-78
LID - 10.1097/OGX.0b013e31828736d5 [doi]
AB  - Fetal alcohol exposure is the leading preventable cause of birth and
      developmental defects in the United States. Despite a growing body of knowledge
      about the spectrum of disorders resulting from fetal alcohol exposure, 1 in 9
      pregnant women continues to drink alcohol during pregnancy, and a small
      percentage of pregnant women continues to binge drink. Health care providers do
      not consistently screen pregnant women for alcohol use, nor do health
      professionals necessarily know how to counsel pregnant women effectively about
      the risks of fetal alcohol exposure. In this article, we review the epidemiology 
      of fetal alcohol exposure and discuss current strategies for screening and
      prevention of fetal alcohol exposure. We also explore the multiple barriers that 
      exist toward reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancies from the patient, provider, and
      systems perspectives. Finally, we make recommendations for improved clinical and 
      public health strategies to eliminate fetal alcohol exposure in the United
      States. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians.
      LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be
      better able to describe rates of fetal alcohol exposure in the United States,
      describe the demographic characteristics of women at highest risk for fetal
      alcohol exposure, counsel patients appropriately regarding the risk of poor fetal
      outcomes in association with fetal alcohol exposure, and understand the barriers 
      to effective counseling about fetal alcohol exposure.

AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a congenital syndrome caused by maternal alcohol 
      consumption during pregnancy and is entirely preventable by abstinence from
      alcohol drinking during this time. Little is known about the prevalence of FAS
      and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Western countries. We
      present the results of FAS/partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) prevalence study
      and maternal characteristics in a sample of schoolchildren from a rural province 
      of Croatia. This study involved seven elementary schools with 1,110 enrolled
      children attending 1st to 4th grade and their mothers. We used an active case
      ascertainment method with passive parental consent and Clarified IOM criteria.
      The investigation protocol involved maternal data collection and clinical
      examination of children. Out of 1,110 mothers, 917 (82.6%) answered the
      questionnaire. Alcohol exposure during pregnancy was admitted by 11.5%, regular
      drinking by 4.0% and binge drinking by 1.4% of questioned mothers. Clinical
      examination involved 824 (74.2%) schoolchildren and disclosed 14 (1.7%) with
      clinical signs of FAS and 41 (5.0%) of PFAS. The observed FAS prevalence, based
      on 74.2% participation rate, was 16.9, PFAS 49.7 and combined prevalence was
      66.7/1,000 examined schoolchildren. This is the first FAS prevalence study based 
      on active ascertainment among schoolchildren and pregnancy alcohol drinking
      analysis performed in a rural community of Croatia and Europe. High prevalence of
      FAS/PFAS and pregnancy alcohol consumption observed in this study revealed that
      FAS is serious health problem in rural regions as well as a need to develop
      future studies and preventive measures for pregnancy alcohol drinking and FASD.

TI  - Altered accuracy of saccadic eye movements in children with fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder.
PG  - 1491-8
LID - 10.1111/acer.12119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is a major, preventable cause of
      neurobehavioral dysfunction in children worldwide. The measurement and
      quantification of saccadic eye movements is a powerful tool for assessing
      sensory, motor, and cognitive function. The quality of the motor process of an
      eye movement is known as saccade metrics. Saccade accuracy is 1 component of
      metrics, which to function optimally requires several cortical brain structures
      as well as an intact cerebellum and brain-stem. The cerebellum has frequently
      been reported to be damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. This study, therefore, 
      tested the hypothesis that children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD)
      will exhibit deficits in the accuracy of saccades. METHODS: A group of children
      with FASD (n = 27) between the ages of 8 and 16 and typically developing control 
      children (n = 27) matched for age and sex, completed 3 saccadic eye movement
      tasks of increasing difficulty. Eye movement performance during the tasks was
      captured using an infrared eye tracker. Saccade metrics (e.g., velocity,
      amplitude, accuracy) were quantified and compared between the 2 groups for the 3 
      different tasks. RESULTS: Children with FASD were more variable in saccade
      endpoint accuracy, which was reflected by statistically significant increases in 
      the error of the initial saccade endpoint and the frequency of additional,
      corrective saccades required to achieve final fixation. This increased
      variability in accuracy was amplified when the cognitive demand of the tasks
      increased. Children with FASD also displayed a statistically significant increase
      in response inhibition errors. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that children with
      FASD may have deficits in eye movement control and sensory-motor integration
      including cerebellar circuits, thereby impairing saccade accuracy.

PG  - 87-95
LID - 10.1097/ADM.0b013e31828b47a8 [doi]
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are conditions caused by prenatal
      alcohol exposure in amounts sufficient to cause permanent deficits in brain
      functioning. Extent of damage largely depends on timing, dose, frequency, and
      pattern of exposure. Timing is especially important because prenatal alcohol
      exposure during critical periods of gestation can affect brain development in
      ways that produce varying patterns of neurocognitive deficits and associated
      adaptive impairments. This article describes some of the more serious
      neurophysiological and neuropsychological sequelae of prenatal alcohol exposure
      that contribute to increased risk for substance abuse problems among people with 
      an FASD. We discuss the unique interface between pharmacological treatment and
      FASD, noting that failure to consider the possibility of FASD in treatment
      planning may result in treatment failure and/or relapse. Finally, we present a
      clinical case example and recommend service accommodations to address some of the
      impairments in FASD that limit substance abuse treatment success.

TI  - Comments and reflections on ethics in screening for biomarkers of prenatal
      alcohol exposure.
PG  - 1451-5
LID - 10.1111/acer.12115 [doi]
AB  - Early identification of and intervention for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
      (FASD) has been shown to optimize outcomes for affected individuals. Detecting
      biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in neonates may assist in the
      identification of children at risk of FASD enabling targeted early interventions.
      Despite these potential benefits, complicated ethical issues arise in screening
      for biomarkers of PAE and these must be addressed prior to the implementation of 
      screening programs. Here, we identify and comment, based on a North American
      perspective, on concerns raised in the current ethical, social, and legal
      literature related to meconium screening for PAE. Major ethical concerns revolve 
      around the targeting of populations for PAE screening, consent and respect for
      persons, stigma and participation rates, the cost-benefit analysis of a screening
      program, consequences of false-positive and false-negative test results,
      confidentiality and appropriate follow-up to positive screen results, and the use
      of screen results for criminal prosecution. We identify gaps in the literature on
      screening for PAE, most notably related to a lack of stakeholder perspectives
      (e.g., parents, healthcare providers) about screening and the ethical challenges 
      it presents.

TI  - Food insecurity and alcohol use among pregnant women at alcohol-serving
      establishments in South Africa.
PG  - 309-17
LID - 10.1007/s11121-013-0386-6 [doi]
AB  - South Africa has the highest rate of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the world.
      While efforts have been made to curb the high rate of FAS, little is known about 
      situational factors that may contribute to alcohol use during pregnancy. In the
      current paper, we focus on the role of food insecurity and its relationship to
      alcohol use among pregnant women. Women completed computer-assisted interviews.
      Generalized linear modeling was used in all analyses. Women attending
      alcohol-serving establishments in a township in Cape Town, South Africa were
      recruited for the study. Five hundred sixty women were sampled and 95 women
      reported being pregnant. High levels of alcohol use were reported among pregnant 
      women: 65 % of women consumed alcohol at least every month and 29 % consumed
      alcohol as often as two to three times per week. Thirty-four percent of the women
      reported having six or more drinks per occasion on at least a weekly basis. The
      majority (87 %) of pregnant women reported experiencing some form of food
      insecurity (e.g., food unavailable, eating less) in the past month. Alcohol use
      was significantly associated with food insecurity, even when controlling for
      relevant demographic variables. Intervention with pregnant women who consume
      alcohol is urgently needed. Future research should focus on understanding the
      intersection of food insecurity and alcohol, and how the experience of food
      insecurity may contribute to greater rates of alcohol use and abuse among
      pregnant women.

TI  - Dental hospital admissions in the children of mothers with an alcohol-related
      diagnosis: a population-based, data-linkage study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between maternal alcohol-use disorder 
      and dental hospital admissions in children up to 5 years of age. STUDY DESIGN:
      Mothers with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision/10th
      revision alcohol-related diagnosis, a proxy for alcohol-use disorder, were
      identified through the Western Australian data-linkage system. Exposed mothers
      were frequency-matched by maternal age, Aboriginal status, and child's birth year
      to randomly selected comparison mothers without an alcohol diagnosis. Linkage
      with the Midwives Notification System (1983-2002) identified all births of these 
      mothers; "exposed" (non-Aboriginal, n = 11,171; Aboriginal, n = 8145) and
      comparison cohorts (non-Aboriginal, n = 32,508; Aboriginal, n = 16,719). Dental
      hospital admissions were identified through linkage with Hospital Morbidity Data 
      (1983-2007) (3.2% exposed; 3.0% comparison) and cases of fetal alcohol syndrome
      (n = 84) through linkage with the Western Australian Register of Developmental
      Anomalies. ORs and 95% CIs for having a dental admission (International
      Classification of Diseases, 9th revision: 520-529; International Classification
      of Diseases, 10th revision: K0-K14.9) were generated by the use of generalized
      estimating equations, which we adjusted for potential confounding factors (aOR). 
      RESULTS: Children of mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis had increased
      adjusted odds of gingivitis and periodontal diseases (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.12-2.51)
      and "other" diseases of the lip and oral mucosa (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.21-2.01).
      Diseases of the salivary glands were increased only in Aboriginal children of
      mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis (aOR 2.65; 95% CI 1.09-6.44). Children 
      diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome had increased ORs of any dental admission
      (aOR 2.58; 95% CI 1.30-5.11). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal alcohol-use disorder was
      associated with dental admissions related to disorders of the soft tissues, but
      questions remain regarding perinatal influences on dental admissions and disease.

TI  - Towards identifying a characteristic neuropsychological profile for fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders. 2. Specific caregiver-and teacher-rating.
PG  - e53-62
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study compares the behavioral profile of children with fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) who were diagnosed using the Canadian Guidelines
      with children with prenatal alcohol exposure who did not meet criteria for a FASD
      diagnosis. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: To accomplish this, we used caregiver and
      teacher questionnaires evaluating different aspects of behavior. Investigated
      were 170 children, 109 who received a diagnosis of FASD (Diagnosed Group) and 61 
      who did not (Non-Diagnosed Group). On the caregiver report, children in the
      Diagnosed Group had more internalizing and externalizing problems on the CBCL,
      more executive function difficulties on the BRIEF and more attention problems on 
      the Conner's Rating Scale, compared to the Non-Diagnosed Group. On teacher
      report, children in the Diagnosed Group had more internalizing and externalizing 
      problems on the TRF and more attention problems on the Conner's Rating Scale,
      compared to the Non-Diagnosed Group. For both informants, more children in the
      Diagnosed group had scores in the clinically elevated range. CONCLUSION: Overall,
      the present results identify key caregiver- and teacher-rated profiles of
      children with FASD diagnoses. These profiles will aid in better understanding,
      diagnosing and providing focused treatment approaches for children with FASD.

TI  - Towards identifying a characteristic neuropsychological profile for fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders. 1. Analysis of the Motherisk FASD clinic.
PG  - e44-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Children with FASD display a heterogeneous profile and may have
      deficits in physical, behavioural, emotional, and social functioning, as the
      result of prenatal alcohol exposure. The major objective of the current study was
      to identify if a specific pattern of neuropsychological functioning exists among 
      children prenatally exposed to alcohol who received a diagnosis, versus exposed
      children who did not. We compared groups on domains of intellectual functioning, 
      memory, attention, executive functioning, motor functioning,
      language/communication and achievement. METHODS: One hundred and seventy children
      who were seen in the clinic between 2005 and 2009 were included in this study.
      Out of the total 170 children seen, 109 received an FASD diagnosis. RESULTS: We
      identified a specific neuropsychological profile that typifies children diagnosed
      with an FASD versus those exposed prenatally to alcohol, who did not receive a
      diagnosis. Diagnosed children displayed a neuropsychological profile
      characterized by weaknesses in the areas of verbal reasoning, memory, overall
      language functioning, math reasoning and calculation. Groups did not differ on
      measures of attention or executive functioning. CONCLUSION: The information
      gained from these analyses, are essential for informing best practices for
      diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Development of a reliable questionnaire to assist in the diagnosis of Fetal
      Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD).
PG  - 33

AB  - BACKGROUND: A battery of clinical assessments was used in the Lililwan Project,
      Australia's first population-based Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)
      prevalence study, conducted in the remote Fitzroy Valley, Western Australia. One 
      objective was to develop and assess test-retest reliability of an acceptable
      questionnaire for collecting health information in remote Aboriginal communities 
      feasible for use in the Lililwan Project. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed 
      by paediatricians to assist in diagnosis of FASD. Content was based on a
      literature review of FASD diagnostic criteria, existing questionnaires and risk
      factors for FASD and birth defects. Aboriginal community members, including
      qualified Aboriginal language interpreters, adapted the questionnaire to ensure
      language and cultural components were appropriate for use in the Fitzroy Valley. 
      Locally developed pictorial aids were used for gathering accurate information on 
      alcohol use. Aboriginal 'community navigators' assisted researchers to translate 
      the questions into Kimberley Kriol or local Aboriginal languages depending on
      participant preference. RESULTS: The full questionnaire contained 112 items and
      took 50 minutes to administer. For a subset of 14 items from the full
      questionnaire percent exact agreement between raters ranged from 59-100%, and was
      below 70% for only 1 question. Test-retest reliability was excellent (Kappa
      0.81-1.00) for 5 items, substantial (Kappa 0.61-0.80) for 5 items, and moderate, 
      fair or slight (Kappa </=0.60) for the remaining 4 items tested. Test-retest
      reliability for questions relating to alcohol use in pregnancy was excellent.
      When questions had moderate, fair or slight agreement, information was obtained
      from alternate sources e.g. medical records. Qualitative feedback from
      parents/carers confirmed acceptability of the questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: This
      questionnaire had acceptable test-retest reliability and could be used to collect
      demographic, socio-cultural and biomedical information relevant to the diagnosis 
      of FASD in Aboriginal communities throughout Australia and elsewhere. Community
      input is crucial when developing and administering questionnaires for use in
      cross-cultural contexts.

TI  - Performance measurement: a proposal to increase use of SBIRT and decrease alcohol
      consumption during pregnancy.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1007/s10995-013-1257-2 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has negative implications for maternal and
      child health. Appropriate early universal Screening, Brief Intervention and
      Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) for pregnant women is necessary to identify women
      at risk and reduce the likelihood of continued drinking. Because SBIRT is not
      consistently used, the development and use of performance measures to assure
      implementation of SBIRT are key steps towards intervention and reduction of
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Practice guidelines provide ample support
      for specific instruments designed for SBIRT in prenatal care. An examination of
      existing performance measures related to alcohol consumption during pregnancy,
      however, reveals no comprehensive published performance measure designed to
      quantify the use of SBIRT for alcohol use in prenatal care. Process performance
      measures were developed that can determine the proportion of pregnant women who
      are screened during the course of prenatal care and the proportion of women
      requiring either brief intervention or referral to substance use disorder
      treatment who received those interventions. The measures require use of screening
      instruments validated for use with pregnant women. The two proposed measures
      would represent a significant step in efforts to assure appropriate intervention 
      for women who drink during pregnancy, hold accountable providers who do not
      employ SBIRT, and provide a basis from which necessary systemic changes might
      occur. Pregnancy is a time when many women are motivated to stop drinking. That
      opportunity should be seized, with timely intervention offering assistance for
      pregnant women who have not stopped drinking of their own accord.

TI  - Facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum.
PG  - e779-88
LID - 10.1542/peds.2012-1371 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Classic facial characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) are
      shortened palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, and thin upper vermillion. We aim 
      to help pediatricians detect facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol
      spectrum, especially among nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) individuals without 
      classic facial characteristics. METHODS: Of 192 Cape Coloured children recruited,
      69 were born to women who reported abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy.
      According to multifaceted criteria, the remainder were allocated clinically to
      the FAS (n = 22), partial FAS (n = 26) or nonsyndromal HE (n = 75) categories. We
      used dense surface modeling and signature analyses of 3-dimensional facial
      photographs to determine agreement between clinical categorization and
      classifications induced from face shape alone, to visualize facial differences,
      and to consider predictive links between face shape and neurobehavior. RESULTS:
      Face classification achieved significant agreement with clinical categories for
      discrimination of nonexposed from FAS alone (face: 0.97-1.00; profile: 0.92) or
      with the addition of partial FAS (face: 0.90; profile: 0.92). Visualizations of
      face signatures delineated dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum and in
      half of the nonsyndromal HE category face signature graphs detected facial
      characteristics consistent with prenatal alcohol exposure. This subgroup
      performed less well on IQ and learning tests than did nonsyndromal subjects
      without classic facial characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Heat maps and morphing
      visualizations of face signatures may help clinicians detect facial dysmorphism
      across the fetal alcohol spectrum. Face signature graphs show potential for
      identifying nonsyndromal heavily exposed children who lack the classic facial
      phenotype but have cognitive impairment.

TI  - The maternal drinking history guide: development of a national educational tool.
PG  - e42-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Taskforce for the development of screening tools for
      FASD has identified maternal drinking as a critical area that should be screened.
      We describe the steps of development and implementation of a knowledge
      translation program for health care providers. The slide presentation is attached
      in English and French to allow its maximal use. METHODS: In 2010, the National
      Taskforce for the development of screening tools for FASD identified maternal
      drinking as a critical area that should be screened. The systematic review and
      associated recommendations have been published and were included in the toolkit
      developed by the Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres with funding
      support from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Effective inquiry of maternal
      drinking can be conducted at three levels: Primary level, as part of
      practice-based screening; Level 2 use of structured questionnaires; and Level 3
      laboratory-based screening. CONCLUSION: It was acknowledged that most physicians 
      do not ask women of reproductive age questions regarding their drinking habits,
      and the Taskforce was seriously concerned that even an effective guide may not
      change practice at the primary level. To that end, the Taskforce developed a
      three phase Knowledge Translation plan, to ensure that the educational program
      developed will be optimally effective for Canadian healthcare providers.

TI  - The feasibility and cost of neonatal screening for prenatal alcohol exposure by
      measuring phosphatidylethanol in dried blood spots.
PG  - 1008-15
LID - 10.1111/acer.12045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate confirmation of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is required 
      as a diagnostic criterion for the majority of children adversely affected by PAE 
      who do not manifest the physical features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.
      A number of ethanol biomarkers have been used to assess PAE, often with
      suboptimal results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and
      cost of PAE screening in newborns by measuring phosphatidylethanol (PEth) in
      dried blood spot (DBS) cards. METHODS: The feasibility of collecting an
      additional DBS card during routine newborn screening and the background
      prevalence of PAE were evaluated in a de-identified sample of newborn children
      delivered at the University of New Mexico Hospital. Electronic orders to collect 
      DBS cards from newborns who continue to bleed after the routine newborn screen,
      glucose, or hematocrit testing were initiated for all infants delivered during a 
      4-week time frame. Specimens were sent to a contract laboratory for PEth analysis
      by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A cost analysis was conducted 
      to compare the cost of PAE screening by PEth in DBS versus PEth in conventional
      blood specimens and by meconium fatty acid ethyl esters. RESULTS: From 230
      collected cards, 201 (87.4%) had at least 1 full blood spot (amount sufficient
      for PEth analysis), and 6.5% had PEth >20 ng/ml indicative of potential PAE in
      late pregnancy. PAE screening by PEth in DBS is logistically simpler and less
      expensive compared with 2 other screening approaches. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      indicate that screening for PAE in DBS cards is a feasible procedure and that a
      majority of infants have enough blood after the routine heel prick to fill an
      additional card. Moreover, screening by PEth analysis from DBS cards is
      cost-efficient. The acceptability of such screening by parents and corresponding 
      ethical issues remain to be investigated.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization, alcohol is the third most dangerous
      factor following smoking of tobacco and hypertension of risks impacting health of
      the population. 50 % of men and 10 % of women suffer from diseases caused by
      alcohol drinking. Chronic consumption of alcohol damages the nervous system,
      causes adverse changes in the circulatory system and intestine, increases the
      risk of cancers. Comparing the impact of alcohol on the health of women and men, 
      in case of women, even similar levels of consumption cause stronger action.
      Alcohol is the cause of endocrine diseases and among others- reduces fertility.
      It is the risk factor of premature deliveries, abortions, and placenta-
      associated pathologies. Disorders of children with prenatal exposure to alcohol
      are described as fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol related neurodevelopmental
      disorders and alcohol related birth defects. It is recommended to impose a total 
      ban on alcohol consumption by pregnant women. Moreover one should emphasize that 
      the minimum safe dose of alcohol for the foetus cannot be specified. In order to 
      resolve alcohol drinking problems a cooperation of representatives of many
      professions such as: doctors, psychologists, educators and employees of care
      facilities is necessary. It is also obligatory to obtain support and assistance
      from the nearest surroundings of the patient.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine alcohol-use disorders in pregnant women and the extent of 
      under-reporting. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Western
      Australia. POPULATION: Women with a birth recorded on the Western Australian
      Midwives Notification System (1985-2006). METHODS: Mothers with an International 
      Classification of Diseases 9/10 alcohol-related diagnosis, indicating heavy
      alcohol consumption, recorded on population-based health datasets (non-Aboriginal
      n=5,839; Aboriginal n=2,583) were identified through the Western Australian
      data-linkage system. This 'exposed' cohort was frequency matched (on maternal
      age, year of birth of offspring, Aboriginal status) with comparison mothers
      without an alcohol-related diagnosis (non-Aboriginal n=33,979; Aboriginal
      n=8,005). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in maternal alcohol diagnoses in relation
      to pregnancy for non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal women. The proportion of children 
      diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) who had a mother with an alcohol
      diagnosis recorded during pregnancy. RESULTS: The proportion of Aboriginal
      mothers in Western Australia with an alcohol diagnosis (23.1%) is ten times
      greater than for non-Aboriginal mothers (2.3%). There has been a six-fold
      increase in the percentage of non-Aboriginal births with a maternal alcohol
      diagnosis recorded during pregnancy and a 100-fold increase for Aboriginal
      births. Around 70% of the mothers of children diagnosed with FAS did not have an 
      alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy and 18% of the mothers had no record 
      of an alcohol diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal alcohol exposure during pregnancy 
      is significantly under-ascertained. Given the severe risks to the fetus from
      heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, assessment and recording of alcohol use should
      be routinely undertaken in maternity and other health settings.

TI  - Maternal drinking behavior and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in adolescents
      with criminal behavior in southern Brazil.
PG  - 960-5
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can have serious and permanent adverse effects. The
      developing brain is the most vulnerable organ to the insults of prenatal alcohol 
      exposure. A behavioral phenotype of prenatal alcohol exposure including conduct
      disorders is also described. This study on a sample of Brazilian adolescents
      convicted for criminal behavior aimed to evaluate possible clinical features of
      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). These were compared to a control group of school
      adolescents, as well as tested for other environmental risk factors for
      antisocial behavior. A sample of 262 institutionalized male adolescents due to
      criminal behavior and 154 male students aged between 13 and 21 years comprised
      the study population. Maternal use of alcohol was admitted by 48.8% of the
      mothers of institutionalized adolescents and by 39.9% of the school students. In 
      this sample of adolescents we could not identify individual cases with a clear
      diagnosis of FAS, but signs suggestive of FASD were more common in the
      institutionalized adolescents. Social factors like domestic and family violence
      were frequent in the risk group, this also being associated to maternal drinking 
      during pregnancy. The inference is that in our sample, criminal behavior is more 
      related to complex interactions between environmental and social issues including
      prenatal alcohol exposure.

PG  - e18-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading cause of
      preventable intellectual disabilities in the United States and a significant
      public health issue. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      knowledge and screening practices of pre-clinical medical students and clinical
      providers on FAS, FASD, and alcohol consumption. METHODS: A short survey sent to 
      medical students and residents on the campus of a large medical school and
      university hospital. RESULTS: On the survey of clinical providers, 38% of
      respondents stated they always survey pregnant women about their alcohol
      consumption, 34% stated they always screen patients planning to get pregnant, and
      9% screen women of childbearing age. There were a significant percentage of
      providers who never screen women. When questioned regarding safe amounts of
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy, 69% of pre-clinical medical students and
      67% of clinical providers stated there is no safe amount of alcohol consumption. 
      Clinical providers were much more likely to correctly select the facial features 
      necessary for the diagnosis (p-value < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Significant
      differences exist in the knowledge and screening practices of these different
      healthcare providers and trainees. Future interventions should seek to improve
      knowledge on FAS, FASD, and alcohol consumption, in order for practitioners to be
      more consistent with national guidelines and the Surgeon General recommendations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol
      Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable,
      biomarkers of alcohol use are sometimes necessary to accurately determine fetal
      risk. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG), a direct metabolite of ethanol, has been detected 
      in the meconium of infants born to mothers who consumed excessive alcohol during 
      pregnancy. It is still unknown whether EtG detected in meconium originated from
      maternal hepatic glucuronidation of ethanol followed by subsequent placental
      transfer. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if EtG crosses 
      the human placenta. METHODS: The transfer of EtG was measured using the ex vivo
      dual perfusion of an isolated human placental lobule. EtG (1 mug/mL) was added to
      the maternal circulation and samples were taken throughout the 1 h
      pre-experimental and 3 h experimental phases for measurement of EtG and markers
      of placental viability. RESULTS: After 3 h, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 0.29 
      +/- 0.02 and net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring. Triplicate
      averages of EtG concentrations in perfused placental lobules ranged from 140 to
      414 ng/g tissue. Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all
      perfusions. DISCUSSION: The data show that EtG crosses the human placenta and
      primarily represents maternal exposure to alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: This information 
      can help with the development of more thorough biomarker screens for alcohol use 
      during pregnancy.

AB  - The characteristics of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) constitute a
      specific facial phenotype, growth failure and neurodevelopmental defects.
      Reported FASD prevalences vary widely from 0.08 per 1,000 up to 68.0-89.2 per
      1,000. We aimed to evaluate to which extent children referred with a suspicion of
      FASD, indeed have FASD. We included all 27 children referred to our genetic
      department with a suspicion of FASD between 2005 and 2010. Nineteen children
      (70.3%) were of non-Dutch ancestry, and 24 (88.9%) had been adopted. We used both
      the 4-Digit Code and the Revised Institute of Medicine criteria. More than half
      of the children did not meet either criteria for the diagnosis of FASD. Of note, 
      after evaluation 8/27 children appeared not to have confirmed prenatal alcohol
      exposure. Two children referred for suspicion of FASD (neither of which were
      exposed to alcohol or met the criteria for FASD) had a pathogenic microstructural
      chromosomal rearrangement (del16p11.2 of 542 KB and dup1q44 of 915 KB). In 22/24 
      children (91.7%) there were other factors that may have affected their
      intellectual abilities, such as familial intellectual disability and social
      deprivation. We recommend a critical approach towards the diagnosis FASD, and to 
      investigate all patients suspected to have FASD for other causative factors
      including genetic abnormalities.

      trial in Russia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in a range of adverse
      pregnancy outcomes including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Risky
      drinking among Russian women constitutes a significant risk for alcohol-exposed
      pregnancies (AEP). Russian women report that obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN)
      physicians are the most important source of information about alcohol consumption
      during pregnancy and developing effective prevention interventions by OB/GYNs is 
      indicated. This is the first study focused on implementation of an AEP prevention
      intervention at women's clinics in Russia. METHOD: The paper describes the
      intervention protocol and addresses questions about the feasibility of a brief
      FASD prevention intervention delivered by OB/GYNs at women's clinics in Russia.
      Brief physician intervention guidelines and two evidence-based FASD prevention
      interventions were utilized to design a brief dual-focused physician intervention
      (DFBPI) appropriate to Russian OB/GYN care. The questions answered were whether
      trained OB/GYN physicians could deliver DFBPI during women's routine clinic
      visits, whether they maintained skills over time in clinical settings, and which 
      specific intervention components were better maintained. Data were collected as
      part of a larger study aimed at evaluating effectiveness of DFBPI in reducing AEP
      risk in non-pregnant women. Methods of monitoring the intervention delivery
      included fidelity check lists (FCL) with the key components of the intervention
      completed by physicians and patients and live and audio taped observations of
      intervention sessions. Physicians (N = 23) and women (N = 372) independently
      completed FCL, and 78 audiotapes were coded. RESULTS: The differences between
      women's and physicians' reports on individual items were not significant.
      Although the majority of physician and patient reports were consistent (N = 305),
      a discrepancy existed between the reports in 57 cases. Women reported more
      intervention components missing compared to physicians (p < 0.001). Discussing
      barriers was the most difficult component for physicians to implement, and OB/GYN
      demonstrated difficulties in discussing contraception methods. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results supported the feasibility of the DFBPI in Russia. OB/GYN physicians
      trained in the DFBPI, monitored, and supported were able to implement and
      maintain skills during the study. In addition to the alcohol focus, DFBPI
      training needs to have a sufficient component to improve physicians' skills in
      discussing contraception use.

TI  - Diagnostic nomenclature for foetal alcohol spectrum disorders: the continuing
      challenge of causality.
PG  - 810-5
LID - 10.1111/cch.12017 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is a risk factor for neurologically based cognitive and
      adaptive disability. Diagnostic nomenclature for prenatally exposed children with
      cognitive and adaptive disability who lack features for foetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS) or partial FAS includes the terms alcohol-related neurodevelopmental
      disorder (ARND) and foetal alcohol spectrum disorder(s) (FASD). Although these
      terms are now widely used, this paper argues that both are problematic. ARND is
      flawed by unjustifiably turning a risk factor into a causal factor and shrouding 
      the result in terminological ambiguity, while FASD is not appropriate as a
      clinical label, and its use as a proxy for ARND deflects critical attention from 
      the causal inferencing that is integral to diagnosing children with an
      alcohol-related teratogenic condition. Existing nomenclature is at odds with
      logical and evidence-based diagnosing and also has implications for
      interpretation of epidemiological data. Diagnostic nomenclature that is not
      tightly linked to causal inference is preferable at the present stage of this
      field's development.

      Mechanisms and Potential Therapeutic Targets.
PG  - 964-91
LID - 10.3390/brainsci3020964 [doi]
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, can 
      result in craniofacial dysmorphism, cognitive impairment, sensory and motor
      disabilities among other defects. FASD incidences are as high as 2% to 5 %
      children born in the US, and prevalence is higher in low socioeconomic
      populations. Despite various mechanisms being proposed to explain the etiology of
      FASD, the molecular targets of ethanol toxicity during development are unknown.
      Proposed mechanisms include cell death, cell signaling defects and gene
      expression changes. More recently, the involvement of several other molecular
      pathways was explored, including non-coding RNA, epigenetic changes and specific 
      vitamin deficiencies. These various pathways may interact, producing a wide
      spectrum of consequences. Detailed understanding of these various pathways and
      their interactions will facilitate the therapeutic target identification, leading
      to new clinical intervention, which may reduce the incidence and severity of
      these highly prevalent preventable birth defects. This review discusses
      manifestations of alcohol exposure on the developing central nervous system,
      including the neural crest cells and sensory neural placodes, focusing on
      molecular neurodevelopmental pathways as possible therapeutic targets for
      prevention or protection.

TI  - Focus on: ethnicity and the social and health harms from drinking.
PG  - 229-37
AB  - Alcohol consumption is differentially associated with social and health harms
      across U.S. ethnic groups. Native Americans, Hispanics, and Blacks are
      disadvantaged by alcohol-attributed harms compared with Whites and Asians.
      Ethnicities with higher rates of risky drinking experience higher rates of
      drinking harms. Other factors that could contribute to the different effects of
      alcohol by ethnicity are social disadvantage, acculturation, drink preferences,
      and alcohol metabolism. This article examines the relationship of ethnicity and
      drinking to (1) unintentional injuries, (2) intentional injuries, (3) fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS), (4) gastrointestinal diseases, (5) cardiovascular
      diseases, (6) cancers, (7) diabetes, and (8) infectious diseases. Reviewed
      evidence shows that Native Americans have a disproportionate risk for
      alcohol-related motor vehicle fatalities, suicides and violence, FAS, and liver
      disease mortality. Hispanics are at increased risk for alcohol-related motor
      vehicle fatalities, suicide, liver disease, and cirrhosis mortality; and Blacks
      have increased risk for alcohol-related relationship violence, FAS, heart
      disease, and some cancers. However, the scientific evidence is incomplete for
      each of these harms. More research is needed on the relationship of alcohol
      consumption to cancers, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS across ethnic groups. Studies also
      are needed to delineate the mechanisms that give rise to and sustain these
      disparities in order to inform prevention strategies.

TI  - Approaching the prevalence of the full spectrum of fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders in a South African population-based study.
PG  - 818-30
LID - 10.1111/acer.12033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD) were determined in this fourth study of first-grade children in 
      a South African community. METHODS: Active case ascertainment methods were
      employed among 747 first-grade pupils. The detailed characteristics of children
      within the continuum of FASD are contrasted with randomly selected, normal
      controls on (i) physical growth and dysmorphology; (ii) cognitive/behavioral
      characteristics; and (iii) maternal risk factors. RESULTS: The rates of specific 
      diagnoses within the FASD spectrum continue to be among the highest reported in
      any community in the world. The prevalence (per 1,000) is as follows: fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS)-59.3 to 91.0; partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS)-45.3
      to 69.6; and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)-30.5 to 46.8. The
      overall rate of FASD is therefore 135.1 to 207.5 per 1,000 (or 13.6 to 20.9%).
      Clinical profiles of the physical and cognitive/behavioral traits of children
      with a specific FASD diagnosis and controls are provided for understanding the
      full spectrum of FASD in a community. The spectral effect is evident in the
      characteristics of the diagnostic groups and summarized by the total (mean)
      dysmorphology scores of the children: FAS = 18.9; PFAS = 14.3; ARND = 12.2; and
      normal controls, alcohol exposed = 8.2 and unexposed = 7.1. Documented drinking
      during pregnancy is significantly correlated with verbal (r = -0.253) and
      nonverbal ability (r = -0.265), negative behaviors (r = 0.203), and total
      dysmorphology score (r = 0.431). Other measures of drinking during pregnancy are 
      significantly associated with FASD, including binge drinking as low as 3 drinks
      per episode on 2 days of the week. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of specific diagnoses 
      within FASD were well documented in this new cohort of children. FASD persists in
      this community. The data reflect an increased ability to provide accurate and
      discriminating diagnoses throughout the continuum of FASD.

AB  - Alcohol exposed pregnancy (AEP) is a leading cause of preventable birth defects. 
      While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that multi-session
      motivational interviewing-based interventions reduce AEP risk, a one-session
      intervention could facilitate broader implementation. The purposes of this study 
      were to: (1) test a one-session motivational AEP prevention intervention for
      community women and (2) compare outcomes to previous RCTs. Participants at risk
      for AEP (N=217) were randomized to motivational interviewing+assessment feedback 
      (EARLY), informational video, or informational brochure conditions. Outcomes were
      drinks per drinking day (DDD), ineffective contraception rate, and AEP risk at 3 
      and 6 months. All interventions were associated with decreased DDD, ineffective
      contraception rate, and AEP risk. Participants who received EARLY had larger
      absolute risk reductions in ineffective contraception and AEP risk, but not DDD. 
      Effect sizes were compared to previous RCTs. The one-session EARLY intervention
      had less powerful effects than multi-session AEP prevention interventions among
      community women, but may provide a new option in a continuum of preventive care.

TI  - Effect of predictive cuing on response inhibition in children with heavy prenatal
      alcohol exposure.
PG  - 644-54
LID - 10.1111/acer.12017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol leads to widespread cognitive
      deficits, including problems with attention and response inhibition. This study
      examined blood oxygen level-dependent response in children with and without
      histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during a task of response inhibition
      consisting of cued and noncued trials. METHODS: Children and adolescents (ages 8 
      to 18 years) with (alcohol-exposed [AE] = 20) and without (control [CON] = 15)
      histories of heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol underwent functional magnetic
      resonance imaging while performing a go/no-go task. Unbeknownst to subjects, a
      predictive cue preceded the no-go stimulus in 87% of trials. RESULTS: Groups were
      matched on demographic variables and did not differ on most measures of task
      performance. However, following cued stimuli, the AE group demonstrated a lower
      hit rate to go stimuli and more conservative response bias than the CON group. AE
      participants demonstrated more activation during no-go trials (inhibition)
      relative to go trials in the left precuneus, cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate,
      and right medial frontal gyrus. During cue-dependent response inhibition, the AE 
      group demonstrated less activation in the left precentral and postcentral gyrus
      compared to the CON group. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous studies of
      response inhibition, the AE group demonstrated greater frontal and parietal
      activation when attempting to inhibit prepotent responses than the CON group,
      despite similar rates of commission errors. This study further demonstrated that 
      the AE group had impaired behavioral performance on cued trials and demonstrated 
      less activation in precentral and postcentral gyri relative to the CON group on
      these trials. This investigation provides evidence of impaired behavioral and
      neural processing of sequential information in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, 
      which can help improve inhibition in typical populations.

AB  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy may result in Fetal Alcohol
      Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which is an umbrella term used to describe a range of
      conditions that are associated with significant neurodevelopmental impairments.
      Communicating an FASD diagnosis to a child is a complex and difficult task that
      requires a great deal of care, particularly due to the sensitive nature of the
      etiology of these disorders. To the best of our knowledge, there are no formal
      guidelines or published materials that outline the ethical considerations
      specifically associated with disclosing an FASD diagnosis to a child. This paper 
      discusses a number of ethical principles and situational factors that should be
      considered when communicating an FASD diagnosis, as well as some of the potential
      risks and benefits associated with disclosure. We also provide recommendations to
      assist clinicians in communicating the diagnosis in a manner that increases
      understanding and minimizes harm to the child. Future recommendations include the
      development of formalized guidelines in order to aid clinicians in carrying out
      this sensitive task.

TI  - A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of spatial working memory in
      children with prenatal alcohol exposure: contribution of familial history of
      alcohol use disorders.
PG  - 132-40

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure leads to widespread cognitive
      deficits, including problems with spatial working memory (SWM). Neuroimaging
      studies report structural and functional abnormalities in fetal alcohol spectrum 
      disorders (FASD), but interpretations may be complicated by the co-occurrence of 
      a family history of alcoholism. Since this history is also linked to cognitive
      deficits and brain abnormalities, it is difficult to determine the extent to
      which deficits are unique to prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: Age-matched
      subjects selected from 2 neuroimaging studies underwent functional imaging while 
      engaging in a task assessing memory for spatial locations relative to a vigilance
      condition assessing attention. Pairwise comparisons were made for the following 3
      groups: children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 18);
      those with no prenatal alcohol exposure, but a confirmed family history of
      alcoholism (FHP, n = 18); and nonexposed, family history negative controls (CON, 
      n = 17). RESULTS: Relative to CON and FHP, the ALC group showed increased blood
      oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left middle and superior frontal
      gyri for the SWM condition relative to the vigilance condition (SWM contrast).
      Additionally, the ALC group showed unique BOLD response increases in the left
      lingual gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus relative to CON, and left cuneus and
      precuneus relative to FHP. Both ALC and FHP showed greater activation compared to
      CON in the lentiform nucleus and insular region. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      confirm previous studies suggesting SWM deficits in FASD. Differences between the
      ALC group and the CON and FHP groups suggest the left middle and superior frontal
      region may be specifically affected in alcohol-exposed children. Conversely,
      differences from the CON group in the lentiform nucleus and insular region for
      the ALC and FHP groups may indicate this region is associated with family history
      of alcoholism rather than specifically with prenatal alcohol exposure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) results in a broad array of
      neurobehavioral deficits. Recent research has focused on identification of a
      neurobehavioral profile or profiles that will improve the identification of
      children affected by AE. This study aimed to build on our preliminary
      neurobehavioral profile to improve classification accuracy and test the
      specificity of the resulting profile in an alternate clinical group. METHODS: A
      standardized neuropsychological test battery was administered to 3 groups of
      children: subjects with AE (n = 209), typically developing controls (CON, n =
      185), and subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n = 74). 
      We assessed a large sample from 6 sites in the United States and South Africa,
      using standardized methodology. Data were analyzed using 3 latent profile
      analyses including (i) subjects with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and controls,
      (ii) subjects with AE without FAS and controls, and (iii) subjects with AE (with 
      or without FAS) and subjects with ADHD. RESULTS: Classification accuracy was
      moderate but significant across the 3 analyses. In analysis 1, overall
      classification accuracy was 76.1% (77.2% FAS, 75.7% CON). In the second analysis,
      overall classification accuracy was 71.5% (70.1% AE/non-FAS, 72.4% CON). In the
      third analysis, overall classification accuracy was 73.9% (59.8% AE, 75.7% ADHD).
      Subjects that were misclassified were examined for systematic differences from
      those that were correctly classified. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study
      indicate that the neuropsychological effects of AE are clinically meaningful and 
      can be used to accurately distinguish alcohol-affected children from both
      typically developing children and children with ADHD. Further, in combination
      with other recent studies, these data suggest that approximately 70% of children 
      with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure are neurobehaviorally affected, while the
      remaining 30% are spared these often-devastating consequences, at least those in 
      the domains under study. Refining the neurobehavioral profile will allow improved
      identification and treatment development for children affected by prenatal
      alcohol exposure.

PG  - e1015-8
LID - 10.1542/peds.2011-1400 [doi]
AB  - Very little is known about the alcohol elimination rates of newborns who have had
      chronic alcohol exposure in utero. In these case reports, blood alcohol levels
      were taken immediately before delivery, at delivery, and postdelivery for 2
      mothers who drank alcohol during their pregnancies and 3 single-birth newborns.
      Newborn A1 of Mother A had no physical characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome 
      (FAS). The initial blood alcohol level for this newborn was 38.4 mg/dL 129
      minutes after birth, with a subsequent blood alcohol level of 5.5 mg/dL 304
      minutes after delivery, resulting in an alcohol elimination rate of 11.3 mg/dL
      per hour. The blood alcohol level for Mother A was 87.4 mg/dL 66 minutes before
      delivery. Newborn A2 of mother A had FAS. Sixty minutes after delivery, the blood
      alcohol level for this newborn was 39.5 mg/dL, and the alcohol level of the
      mother was 42.1 mg/dL. Newborn B1 of mother B had FAS. At 67 minutes after birth,
      newborn B1 had a blood alcohol level of 246.5 mg/dL, which dropped to 178.7 mg/dL
      302 minutes after birth, resulting in an alcohol elimination rate of 17.3 mg/dL
      per hour. This alcohol elimination rate is within the metabolism range (15-49
      mg/dL per hour) of adults with alcoholism. The maternal blood alcohol level was
      265.9 mg/dL 27 minutes before delivery. Blood alcohol levels drawn on both the
      mother and newborn at delivery and 2 or 3 hourly follow-up levels can provide
      evidence that fetal alcohol dehydrogenase activity is induced by chronic maternal
      alcohol use.

      and those diagnosed with ADHD; A functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/1866-1955-4-12 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) falls under the
      umbrella of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), but individuals do not
      demonstrate the facial characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS), making diagnosis difficult. While attentional problems in ARND are similar
      to those found in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the underlying
      impairment in attention pathways may be different. METHODS: Functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) of a working memory (1-back) task of 63 children, 10 to 
      14 years old, diagnosed with ARND and ADHD, as well as typically developing (TD) 
      controls, was conducted at 3 T. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were also
      acquired. RESULTS: Activations were observed in posterior parietal and occipital 
      regions in the TD group and in dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal
      regions in the ARND group, whereas the ADHD group activated only dorsolateral
      prefrontal regions, during the working memory component of the task (1-back minus
      0-back contrast). The increases in frontal and parietal activity were
      significantly greater in the ARND group compared to the other groups. This
      increased activity was associated with reduced accuracy and increased response
      time variability, suggesting that ARND subjects exert greater effort to manage
      short-term memory load. Significantly greater intra-subject variability,
      demonstrated by fMRI region-of-interest analysis, in the ADHD and ARND groups
      compared to the TD group suggests that moment-to-moment lapses in attention
      contributed to their poorer task performance. Differences in functional activity 
      in ARND subjects with and without a diagnosis of ADHD resulted primarily from
      reduced activation by the ARND/ADHD + group during the 0-back task. In contrast, 
      children with ADHD alone clearly showed reduced activations during the 1-back
      task. DTI analysis revealed that the TD group had significantly higher total
      tract volume and number of fibers than the ARND group. These measures were
      negatively correlated with errors on the 1-back task, suggesting a link between
      white matter integrity and task performance. CONCLUSIONS: fMRI activations
      suggest that the similar behavior of children with ARND and ADHD on a spatial
      working memory task is the result of different cognitive events. The nature of
      ADHD in children with ARND appears to differ from that of children with ADHD
      alone.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure may have adverse effects on the developing foetus
      resulting in significant growth restriction, characteristic craniofacial
      features, and central nervous system dysfunction. The toxic effects of alcohol on
      the developing brain are well recognised. However, little is known about the
      effects of alcohol on the developing gastrointestinal tract or their mechanism.
      There are few case reports showing an association between foetal alcohol syndrome
      and gastrointestinal neuropathy. We report a rare association between foetal
      alcohol syndrome and severe gastrooesophageal reflux disease in an infant who
      ultimately required fundoplication to optimise her growth and nutrition. The
      child had failed to respond to maximal medical treatment (domperidone and
      omeprazole), high calorie feeds, PEG feeding, or total parenteral nutrition. The 
      effect of alcohol on the developing foetus is not limited to the central nervous 
      system but also can have varied and devastating effects on the gastrointestinal
      tract.

TI  - Alcohol-related harm to others in New Zealand: evidence of the burden and gaps in
      knowledge.
PG  - 11-27
AB  - AIM: To identify and summarise existing New Zealand data quantifying any aspects 
      of harm experienced from the drinking of others. METHODS: Surveys, research data,
      and administrative databases were identified through literature searching,
      examination of websites of relevant agencies, and direct enquiry among those
      working in research, government agencies and relevant NGOs. Accessible data were 
      analysed, and published or collated data were summarised. RESULTS: The prevalence
      of self-reported harm from others' drinking was higher than harm from own
      drinking (18% vs 12% in the past year) and was higher in women and young people. 
      Most available data described aggression and crime, and unintentional injury due 
      to traffic crashes and fires. No useable data were obtained on harm to children. 
      Police records suggested that a third to a half of offences involved someone who 
      had been drinking, and alcohol involvement increased with seriousness.
      Self-reported violence involved a drinking perpetrator in about half of cases;
      more likely in stranger violence than family violence, but common in both. About 
      40% of those injured in alcohol-related traffic crashes were not the drinker
      responsible, and this represented about one in eight of all traffic injuries.
      Approximately one in eight unintentional residential fire deaths were innocent
      victims of alcohol-related fires. CONCLUSION: The range and magnitude of harms
      from others' drinking are substantial, but not well described. Shortcomings in
      the data systems of agencies dealing with people harmed by the drinking of others
      hamper surveillance, monitoring of effectiveness of interventions and advocacy
      for policy to reduce alcohol-related harm.

TI  - Higher functioning children with prenatal alcohol exposure: is there a specific
      neurocognitive profile?
PG  - 561-78
LID - 10.1080/09297049.2012.713466 [doi]
AB  - Recent attempts to identify a neurocognitive profile of children with prenatal
      alcohol exposure (PAE) have led to an emerging "generalized deficit"
      conceptualization marked by diffuse information processing and integration
      difficulties as opposed to a specific profile. This study examines whether this
      conceptualization can be extended to higher functioning children with PAE who are
      without intellectual disability and addresses several limitations of previous
      research. One hundred twenty-five children aged 6-12 years with social skills
      deficits, 97 of whom met diagnostic criteria for a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorder (FASD), underwent a comprehensive, multi-informant assessment of
      neurocognitive, emotional, social, behavioral, and adaptive functioning.
      Multivariate analyses of variance examined differences in functioning between the
      PAE group and a nonexposed comparison group with and without controlling for
      child IQ. Results indicated that the PAE group returned significantly poorer
      scores than the nonexposed group on every construct assessed, including executive
      functioning, attention, working/visuospatial memory, linguistic abstraction,
      adaptive behavior, emotional/behavioral functioning, and social cognition. These 
      differences largely maintained after controlling for IQ and were similar
      regardless of informant, although teachers reported somewhat fewer group
      differences. Within the PAE group, no differences were found across FASD
      subtypes. These results provide evidence extending the emerging generalized
      deficit conceptualization of children with PAE to those higher functioning
      individuals without global intellectual disability.

TI  - Health care burden and cost associated with fetal alcohol syndrome: based on
      official Canadian data.
PG  - e43024
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0043024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a group of disorders caused
      by prenatal alcohol exposure. From this group, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is
      the only disorder coded in the International Classification of Diseases, version 
      10 (ICD-10). This coding was used to gain an understanding on the health care
      utilization and the mortality rate for individuals diagnosed with FAS, as well as
      to estimate the associated health care costs in Canada for the most recent
      available fiscal year (2008-2009). METHODS: Health care utilization data
      associated with a diagnosis of FAS were directly obtained from the Canadian
      Institute for Health Information (CIHI). Mortality data associated with a
      diagnosis of FAS were obtained from Statistics Canada. RESULTS: The total direct 
      health care cost of acute care, psychiatric care, day surgery, and emergency
      department services associated with FAS in Canada in 2008-2009, based on the
      official CIHI data, was about $6.7 million. The vast majority of the most
      responsible diagnoses, which account for the majority of a patient's length of
      stay in hospital, fall within the ICD-10 category Mental and Behavioural
      Disorders (F00-F99). It was evident that the burden and cost of acute care
      hospitalizations due to FAS is increasing -1.6 times greater in 2008-2009,
      compared to 2002-2003. The mortality data due to FAS, obtained from Statistics
      Canada (2000-2008), may be underreported, and are likely invalid. DISCUSSION: The
      official data on the utilization of health care services by individuals diagnosed
      with FAS are likely to be underreported and therefore, the reported cost figures 
      are most likely underestimated. The quantification of the health care costs
      associated with FAS is crucial for policy developers and decision makers alike,
      of the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure, with the ultimate goal of initiating 
      preventive interventions to address FASD.

LID - 10.5664/jcsm.2038 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep problems in children with fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD) are reportedly common but not well characterized. Objectives
      were to: (1) assess sleep concerns in children with FASD using a caregiver-report
      survey, the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ); (2) compare CSHQ
      results with those of previously reported community sample; and (3) describe
      pilot polysomnography findings in children with FASD. METHODS: Children with FASD
      were recruited from a behavioral intervention study, and participating caregivers
      completed the CSHQ. CSHQ results were compared with the original data from a
      previously published community sample of similar age. Participants with FASD and 
      elevated CSHQ scores were offered overnight polysomnography. RESULTS:
      Thirty-three children with FASD (4.1-12.1 years) were enrolled; 85% of children
      with FASD scored above the clinical cutoff Total Score of 41, reflecting marked
      sleep disturbance. Elevated subdomain scores occurred primarily in areas
      concerning for pediatric insomnia. Those with comorbid ADHD had elevated CSHQ on 
      additional subdomains with no difference in Total Scores. Compared with the
      community sample, children with FASD had higher Total Scores on the CSHQ (52 vs. 
      39, p < 0.001). Polysomnography, completed in 5 subjects, revealed mild sleep
      disordered breathing and fragmented sleep with elevated non-respiratory arousal
      indices. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant sleep problems are present in
      children with FASD on both subjective and objective measures. Further
      investigation is needed to better describe these sleep disturbances and their
      impact on overall health and daytime neurobehavioral problems in this clinical
      population.

TI  - Alcohol exposure during late gestation: multiple developmental outcomes in sheep.
PG  - 224-36
LID - 10.1017/S2040174412000244 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy remains common in many countries. Exposure
      to even low amounts of alcohol (i.e. ethanol) in pregnancy can lead to the
      heterogeneous fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), while heavy alcohol
      consumption can result in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is characterized 
      by cerebral dysfunction, growth restriction and craniofacial malformations.
      However, the effects of lower doses of alcohol during pregnancy, such as those
      that lead to FASD, are less well understood. In this article, we discuss the
      findings of recent studies performed in our laboratories on the effects of fetal 
      alcohol exposure using sheep, in which we investigated the effects of late
      gestational alcohol exposure on the developing brain, arteries, kidneys, heart
      and lungs. Our studies indicate that alcohol exposure in late gestation can (1)
      affect cerebral white matter development and increase the risk of hemorrhage in
      the fetal brain, (2) cause left ventricular hypertrophy with evidence of altered 
      cardiomyocyte maturation, (3) lead to a decrease in nephron number in the kidney,
      (4) cause altered arterial wall stiffness and endothelial and smooth muscle
      function and (5) result in altered surfactant protein mRNA expression, surfactant
      phospholipid composition and pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in the
      lung. These findings suggest that fetal alcohol exposure in late gestation can
      affect multiple organs, potentially increasing the risk of disease and organ
      dysfunction in later life.

TI  - Explanation of social inequalities in hyperactivity/inattention in children with 
      prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 303-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperactivity and inattention are major effects of prenatal alcohol
      exposure (PAE). Although predominantly women from the high social class consume
      alcohol during pregnancy, children from the low social class are particularly
      affected by the adverse effects of PAE. This study aimed to test the hypothesis
      of a social gradient in hyperactivity/inattention in children with PAE. METHODS: 
      Children with PAE (N=996) enrolled in the German Health Interview and Examination
      Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) were studied. KiGGS was designed and 
      conducted by Robert Koch Institute (RKI) as a nationwide representative survey on
      the health of German children and adolescents aged 0-17 years. The data include
      information given by parents and adolescents on the physical and mental health,
      sociodemographic features, life circumstances and conditions. RESULTS: PAE
      children with a middle and low parental socioeconomic status (SES) are on a
      higher risk of developing hyperactivity/inattention compared to those with high
      parental SES. Cultural-behavioral factors had the strongest effect in the
      explanation of social inequalities in hyperactivity/inattention among children
      with PAE. CONCLUSIONS: Cultural-behavioral factors, particularly health-related
      behaviors, need a significant improvement in children from the low and middle
      social class. To reduce social inequalities in hyperactivity in children with
      PAE, interventions have to focus on the dietary and television habits of the
      child by reaching parents from the low and middle social class.

TI  - Alcohol use and binge drinking among women of childbearing age--United States,
      2006-2010.
PG  - 534-8
AB  - Alcohol use during pregnancy is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and 
      developmental disabilities. Alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEPs) can lead to fetal 
      alcohol syndrome and other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), which result
      in neurodevelopmental deficits and lifelong disability. In 2005, the Surgeon
      General issued an advisory urging women who are pregnant or who might become
      pregnant to abstain from alcohol use. Healthy People 2020 set specific targets
      for abstinence from alcohol use (MICH-11.1) and binge drinking (MICH-11.2) for
      pregnant women. To estimate the prevalence of any alcohol use and binge drinking 
      in the past 30 days among women aged 18-44 years, CDC analyzed 2006-2010
      Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. Based on their
      self-reports, an estimated 51.5% of nonpregnant women used alcohol, as did 7.6%
      of pregnant women. The prevalence of binge drinking was 15.0% among nonpregnant
      women and 1.4% among pregnant women. Among pregnant women, the highest prevalence
      estimates of reported alcohol use were among those who were aged 35-44 years
      (14.3%), white (8.3%), college graduates (10.0%), or employed (9.6%). Among binge
      drinkers, the average frequency and intensity of binge episodes were similar,
      approximately three times per month and six drinks on an occasion, among those
      who were pregnant and those who were not. Clinical practices that advise women
      about the dangers associated with drinking while pregnant, coupled with
      community-level interventions that reduce alcohol-related harms, are necessary to
      mitigate AEP risk among women of childbearing age and to achieve the Healthy
      People 2020 objectives.

TI  - Primary visual response (M100) delays in adolescents with FASD as measured with
      MEG.
PG  - 2852-62
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22110 [doi]
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are debilitating, with effects of
      prenatal alcohol exposure persisting into adolescence and adulthood. Complete
      characterization of FASD is crucial for the development of diagnostic tools and
      intervention techniques to decrease the high cost to individual families and
      society of this disorder. In this experiment, we investigated visual system
      deficits in adolescents (12-21 years) diagnosed with an FASD by measuring the
      latency of patients' primary visual M100 responses using MEG. We hypothesized
      that patients with FASD would demonstrate delayed primary visual responses
      compared to controls. M100 latencies were assessed both for FASD patients and
      age-matched healthy controls for stimuli presented at the fovea (central
      stimulus) and at the periphery (peripheral stimuli; left or right of the central 
      stimulus) in a saccade task requiring participants to direct their attention and 
      gaze to these stimuli. Source modeling was performed on visual responses to the
      central and peripheral stimuli and the latency of the first prominent peak (M100)
      in the occipital source timecourse was identified. The peak latency of the M100
      responses were delayed in FASD patients for both stimulus types (central and
      peripheral), but the difference in latency of primary visual responses to central
      vs. peripheral stimuli was significant only in FASD patients, indicating that,
      while FASD patients' visual systems are impaired in general, this impairment is
      more pronounced in the periphery. These results suggest that basic sensory
      deficits in this population may contribute to sensorimotor integration deficits
      described previously in this disorder.

TI  - A new method for quantifying prenatal exposure to ethanol by microwave-assisted
      extraction (MAE) of meconium followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
      (GC-MS).

AB  - Ethanol is a legal and widely available substance. There are health and social
      consequences associated with its abuse. One of the most important problems is
      related to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In fact, prenatal ethanol
      exposure can be associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), a term
      used to describe a wide range of potentially lifelong effects that include
      physical, mental, behavioral, and learning disabilities. Fatty acid ethyl esters 
      (FAEEs), which are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol, are currently used as
      biomarkers of direct ethanol consumption in different matrices, including hair,
      blood, skin surface, and meconium. Analysis of these compounds in meconium
      reveals exposure to alcohol during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. 
      An important finding for evaluation of gestational ethanol exposure is the fact
      that FAEEs do not cross the placenta. Because they accumulate in the fetal gut
      from approximately the 20th week of gestation until birth, this provides a wide
      window of detection of chronic exposure to alcohol. The sum of the concentrations
      of all the FAEEs, with a cutoff of 2 nmol g(-1) or 600 ng g(-1) meconium, has
      been recommended as evidence of maternal alcohol use. We introduce a novel
      technique to quantify ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl stearate, and their
      deuterated analogues (as internal standards, IS) in meconium using
      microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) coupled with gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (GC-MS). Limits of detection and quantification were 50 and 100 ng
      g(-1) for all analytes except ethyl stearate (LOD 100 ng g(-1) and LOQ 500 ng
      g(-1)). Calibration curves were linear from the LOQ to 5000 ng g(-1). The
      validated method was applied to the analysis of 81 meconium samples.

AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a common cause of intellectual
      impairment and birth defects. More recently, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has 
      been found to be a risk factor for fetal mortality, stillbirth and infant and
      child mortality. This has led to increased concern about detection and management
      of PAE. One to 2 h after maternal ingestion, fetal blood alcohol concentrations
      (BACs) reach levels nearly equivalent to maternal levels. Ethanol elimination by 
      the fetus is impaired because of reduced metabolic capacity. Fetal exposure time 
      is prolonged owing to the reuptake of amniotic-fluid containing ethanol by the
      fetus. Alcohol elimination from the fetus relies on the mother's metabolic
      capacity. Metabolic capacity among pregnant women varies eightfold (from 0.0025
      to 0.02 g dl(-1) h(-1)), which may help explain how similar amounts of ethanol
      consumption during pregnancy results in widely varying phenotypic presentations
      of FASD. At birth physiological changes alter the neonate's metabolic capacity
      and it rapidly rises to a mean value of 83.5% of the mother's capacity. FASDs are
      highly recurrent and younger siblings have increased risk. Detection of prenatal 
      alcohol use offers an important opportunity for office-based interventions to
      decrease exposure for the remainder of pregnancy and identification of women who 
      need substance abuse treatment. Mothers of children with FAS have been found to
      drink faster, get drunk quicker and to have higher BACs. A modest increase in the
      prevalence of a polymorphism of alcohol dehydrogenase, which increases
      susceptibility to adverse outcomes from PAE has been reported. Lastly, detection 
      of alcohol use and appropriate management would decrease risk from PAE for
      subsequent pregnancies.

TI  - Executive function predicts adaptive behavior in children with histories of heavy
      prenatal alcohol exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 1431-41
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01718.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to alcohol often results in disruption to discrete 
      cognitive and behavioral domains, including executive function (EF) and adaptive 
      functioning. In the current study, the relation between these 2 domains was
      examined in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure,
      nonexposed children with a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD), and typically developing controls. METHODS: As part of a multisite study,
      3 groups of children (8 to 18 years, M = 12.10) were tested: children with
      histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 142), nonexposed children 
      with ADHD (ADHD, n = 82), and typically developing controls (CON, n = 133) who
      did not have ADHD or a history of prenatal alcohol exposure. Children completed
      subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS), and their
      primary caregivers completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II. Data were 
      analyzed using regression analyses. RESULTS: Analyses showed that EF measures
      were predictive of adaptive abilities, and significant interactions between
      D-KEFS measures and group were present. For the ADHD group, the relation between 
      adaptive abilities and EF was more general, with 3 of the 4 EF measures showing a
      significant relation with adaptive score. In contrast, for the ALC group, this
      relation was specific to the nonverbal EF measures. In the CON group, performance
      on EF tasks did not predict adaptive scores over the influence of age.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results support prior research in ADHD, suggesting that EF
      deficits are predictive of poorer adaptive behavior and extend this finding to
      include children with heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol. However, the relation
      between EF and adaptive ability differed by group, suggesting unique patterns of 
      abilities in these children. These results provide enhanced understanding of
      adaptive deficits in these populations, as well as demonstrate the ecological
      validity of laboratory measures of EF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both sensory and cognitive deficits have been associated with
      prenatal exposure to alcohol; however, very few studies have focused on sensory
      deficits in preschool-aged children. As sensory skills develop early,
      characterization of sensory deficits using novel imaging methods may reveal
      important neural markers of prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: Participants in
      this study were 10 children with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and 15 
      healthy control (HC) children aged 3 to 6 years. All participants had normal
      hearing as determined by clinical screens. We measured their neurophysiological
      responses to auditory stimuli (1,000 Hz, 72 dB tone) using magnetoencephalography
      (MEG). We used a multidipole spatio-temporal modeling technique to identify the
      location and timecourse of cortical activity in response to the auditory tones.
      The timing and amplitude of the left and right superior temporal gyrus sources
      associated with activation of left and right primary/secondary auditory cortices 
      were compared across groups. RESULTS: There was a significant delay in M100 and
      M200 latencies for the FASD children relative to the HC children (p = 0.01), when
      including age as a covariate. The within-subjects effect of hemisphere was not
      significant. A comparable delay in M100 and M200 latencies was observed in
      children across the FASD subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Auditory delay revealed by MEG in
      children with FASDs may prove to be a useful neural marker of information
      processing difficulties in young children with prenatal alcohol exposure. The
      fact that delayed auditory responses were observed across the FASD spectrum
      suggests that it may be a sensitive measure of alcohol-induced brain damage.
      Therefore, this measure in conjunction with other clinical tools may prove useful
      for early identification of alcohol affected children, particularly those without
      dysmorphia.

TI  - Neonatal screening for prenatal alcohol exposure: assessment of voluntary
      maternal participation in an open meconium screening program.
PG  - 269-76
LID - 10.1016/j.alcohol.2011.09.029 [doi]
AB  - Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are validated biomarkers of fetal
      alcohol exposure. Meconium FAEE testing can potentially be used as a screen by
      health-care professionals to identify neonates at-risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorder, thereby permitting diagnostic follow-up of these children and early
      intervention in those who develop disabilities. The purpose of this study was to 
      assess whether women would willingly partake in a screening program of this
      nature. This was determined by launching a pilot screening program for prenatal
      alcohol exposure in a high-risk obstetric unit previously shown to have a high
      prevalence of FAEE-positive meconium via anonymous meconium testing. The program 
      involved voluntary testing of meconium for FAEEs and long-term developmental
      follow-up of positive cases through an existing public health program. The
      participation rate in the screening program was significantly lower than when
      testing was conducted anonymously (78% vs. 95%, respectively; p < 0.05), and the 
      positivity rate was 3% in contrast to 30% observed under anonymous conditions (p 
      < 0.001). These low rates suggest that the majority of mothers who consumed
      alcohol in pregnancy refused to participate. We conclude that despite the
      potential benefits of such screening programs, maternal unwillingness to consent,
      likely due to fear, embarrassment, and guilt, may limit the effectiveness of
      meconium testing for population-based open screening, highlighting the need for
      public education and social marketing efforts for such programs to be of benefit.

AB  - Aboriginal women in the remote Fitzroy Valley region in Western Australia's
      Kimberley were concerned about high rates of alcohol use in pregnancy and its
      possible impact on child development. They successfully lobbied for restricted
      access to alcohol in 2007. In 2009 they developed a strategy for the diagnosis
      and prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the support of
      parents and carers of affected children. Aboriginal organisations then partnered 
      with research and clinical groups from Sydney to conduct a FASD prevalence study.
      This commenced in 2010 following extensive community consultation and receipt of 
      community consent. Data from this study are still being collected and will be
      used by the community to advocate for improved services and new models of health 
      care. Prevention of FASD is important to optimise health and development for
      future generations of Aboriginal children and to ensure the transfer of culture
      and language from one generation to the next.

TI  - Children and adolescents with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS): better social and
      emotional integration after early diagnosis.
PG  - 66-71
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1299682 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcoholism during pregnancy is one of the most common factors in
      western societies causing persisting congenital and multiple physical as well as 
      neurological impairments. Finding the diagnosis at first sight puts medical
      professionals into a demanding situation. Therefore the objective of this study
      was to detect patients' developmental characteristics with the main focus on the 
      necessity of the diagnosis itself. PATIENTS: 125 young patients, whose diagnosis 
      of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made at the Muenster University Hospital,
      were followed up. METHODS: Biographic details such as living conditions, health, 
      developmental problems and educational career were gathered using a structured
      interview. The diagnosis itself and the impact of this on the patients were also 
      explored. RESULTS: Patients displayed characteristics of a less mature trait of
      character. The majority were looked after by foster parents. High rates of social
      and developmental problems could be found. The diagnosis was identified as a
      protective factor, with significantly better outcomes for patients being
      diagnosed in early childhood. A diagnosis established later in life was
      particularly helpful for the families and caregivers. Feelings of failure and
      self-blame could be diminished. CONCLUSIONS: The early detection of affected
      children has to be improved as receiving the correct diagnosis, despite the
      persistent impairments, is of major benefit for both patients and their families.

TI  - An exploration of the experiences and perspectives of New Zealanders with fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorder.
PG  - e41-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: The experiences and perspectives of New Zealanders with fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder (FASD) need to be heard since no research to date has been
      performed. FASD, a neuro-developmental disability with life-lasting effects, is
      irreversible. The condition is caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol.
      OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore and understand the daily challenges of
      New Zealand individuals with FASD. METHODS: Our sequential mixed methods design
      used two discrete but compatible qualitative methodologies--transcendental
      phenomenology in Phase One and classic grounded theory in Phase Two--framed by
      the meta-theory of pragmatism, which allows the use of 'what works' in research. 
      One methodology alone would not have answered our research question. Using the
      same sample of 14 individuals, 14 to 37 years, two separate data sets were
      produced sequentially using face-to-face unstructured interviews. Participants
      had been diagnosed with either fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol
      effects (FAE). Data credibility was checked using triangulation. RESULTS: Six
      themes common to the participants' experiences emerged: daily challenges in the
      classroom; daily challenges in the workplace; coping with mental health issues;
      memory problems; socialization difficulties and involvement with the law and
      authority. Phase Two's emerging theory revealed that because the participants
      perceived they had been under-supported by the social/health systems, many
      engaged in illegal behaviours (secondary disabilities) and experienced employment
      and social problems. Many disavowed having the disability, but with maturity and 
      knowing the signs and symptoms, accepted it. They suggested ways in which their
      concerns could be resolved. CONCLUSION: In order that progress in this field can 
      take place, health and social agencies, educational and criminal justice systems 
      and policy-makers need to have increased awareness of the disability and the
      complex problems that individuals with the disability and their families face.

AB  - The indications of brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in
      fetal alcohol syndrome are not clearly defined, even though the condition is
      recognized as one of the most common causes of mental retardation. This article
      reports a case of a 9-year-old adopted girl with developmental delay, mildly
      dysmorphic facial features, and behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. Extensive
      investigations including genetic studies and brain magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) revealed no abnormalities, and a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome was
      considered since official diagnostic criteria were met. A brain SPECT was
      requested and showed severely decreased tracer activity in the thalami, basal
      ganglia, and temporal lobes on both sides, the overall findings being consistent 
      with the established diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. With increasing
      availability of functional brain imaging, the study indications and possible
      ethical implications in suspected prenatal alcohol exposure or even before
      adoption need further consideration. In this patient, SPECT was the only test to 
      yield positive results.

AB  - In the United States, approximately 80 000 women consume ethanol through all 3
      trimesters of pregnancy each year. In this article, we review prevalence rates of
      prenatal alcohol exposure in the United States and discuss the mechanisms of
      prenatal alcohol exposure and placental-umbilical effects. Cigarette smoking and 
      delayed prenatal care are often associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. In
      addition, increased risk for postnatal adversity is common, including maternal
      depression, foster care placement, and developmental delay. In part 2, we review 
      prevalence rates and the diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder 
      and the implications for child neurologists. We discuss management strategies and
      the importance of a long-term management plan and anticipatory management to
      prevent the development of secondary disabilities in fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders. Child neurologists play a key role in diagnosis and the development of
      appropriate intervention programs for affected children and their families.

AB  - The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical,
      mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objective assessment of exposure to
      ethanol at both prenatal and postnatal stages is essential for early prevention
      and intervention. Since pregnant women tend to underreport alcohol drinking by
      questionnaires, a number of biological markers have been proposed and evaluated
      for their capability to highlight gestational drinking behaviour. These
      biomarkers include classical biomarkers (albeit indirect) of alcohol-induced
      pathology (mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT),
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT))
      acetaldehyde-derived conjugates, and finally derivatives of non-oxidative ethanol
      metabolism (fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG), ethyl
      sulphate (EtS) and phosphaditylethanol (PEth)). Since ethanol itself and
      acetaldehyde are only measured few hours after ethanol intake in conventional
      matrices such as blood, urine and sweat, they are only useful to detect recent
      ethanol exposure. In the past few years, the non-oxidative ethanol metabolites
      have received increasing attention because of their specificity and in some case 
      wide time-window of detection in non-conventional matrices from the pregnant
      mother (oral fluid and hair) and fetus-newborn (neonatal hair, meconium, placenta
      and umbilical cord). This article reviews bioanalytical procedures for the
      determination of these markers of ethanol consumption during pregnancy and
      related prenatal exposure. In addition, clinical toxicological applications of
      these procedures are presented and discussed.

TI  - Childhood behavioural and developmental disorders: association with maternal
      alcohol consumption in Cape Town, South Africa.
PG  - 724, 726-7
AB  - Current maternal alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, is strongly
      associated with childhood behavioural and/or developmental disorders (BDDs) in a 
      population attending tertiary hospital ambulatory services. BDDs were also
      associated with maternal alcohol use 6 months before pregnancy. An association
      with BDDs could not be conclusively demonstrated for drinking during pregnancy,
      but this may have been influenced by under-reporting and reduced study power due 
      to misclassification of exposure. We cannot rule out the a priori suspicion that 
      some mild BDDs in children in the Western Cape could be undiagnosed fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder. Nonetheless, the study highlighted the important impact of
      current maternal alcohol use on behaviour and development of children. Future
      research on the impact of maternal alcohol use on childhood development should
      include examination of environmental and social factors contributing to this
      increased risk. Upstream interventions aimed at reducing alcohol-related harms
      may also contribute to reducing the burden of BDDs.

LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090181 [doi]
AB  - In this study event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the
      effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on response inhibition identified during
      task performance. ERPs were recorded during a auditory Go/No Go task in two
      groups of children with mean age of 12.8 years (11 years to 14.7 years): one
      diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (FAS/PFAS; n = 12) and
      a control group of children of same age whose mothers abstained from alcohol or
      drank minimally during pregnancy (n = 11). The children were instructed to push a
      button in response to the Go stimulus and not to press the button when the No Go 
      stimulus were heard. Task performance accuracy did not differ between the two
      groups, however differences were observed in the ERP components: P2, N2, and P3. 
      The P2 amplitude were larger for Go trials in both groups. The FAS/PFAS group
      showed slower N2 response to Go trials, suggesting a less efficient early
      classification of the stimulus. P3 showed larger amplitudes to No-Go vs. Go in
      both groups. The study has provided new evidence for inhibition deficits in
      FAS/PFAS subjects identified by ERPs.

TI  - Alcohol-induced behavioural problems in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders versus
      confounding behavioural problems.
PG  - e32-40
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is strongly associated with disruptive behaviour in
      childhood and antisocial behaviour later in life. There are numerous confounding 
      risk factors in the lives of alcohol-abusing mothers that may contribute to the
      behaviour problems seen in their children, rather than direct brain injury by
      alcohol. In fact, many of these additional environmental and genetic risk factors
      for childhood behaviour problems co-occur with prenatal alcohol exposure and
      affect the same child, creating a confluence of risk. As a result, one cannot
      with any certainty attribute behaviour problems in an individual child to
      prenatal alcohol exposure. This has important clinical and legal implications.

TI  - Clinical use of meconium fatty acid ethyl esters for identifying children at risk
      for alcohol-related disabilities: the first reported case.
PG  - e26-31
AB  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium are validated biomarkers of heavy
      fetal alcohol exposure that may potentially be used clinically for identifying
      children at risk for alcohol-related disabilities. However, until now, FAEEs have
      been largely used anonymously in epidemiological studies, and by child protection
      authorities in need for verification of heavy alcohol use in pregnancy. Here we
      describe the first case of a neonate identified as part of a research study on a 
      pilot neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure. The neonate's
      meconium tested high for FAEEs (52 nmol/g; positive cut-off >/= 2 nmol/g), which 
      prompted active follow-up of the infant's development, identifying early
      neurocognitive problems and allowing initiation of a remedial program.

LID - 10.1177/0883073811428377 [doi]
AB  - In part 1, we discussed the mechanism of alcohol exposure, dosimetry, and the
      teratogenic pathways of damage to the fetus. In part 2, we review the diagnosis
      of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and the developmental implications of
      prenatal alcohol exposure. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are associated with
      increased rates of mental retardation, seizure disorders, brain malformations,
      and premature mortality. The risk of comorbid disorders is increased among this
      population, which enhances phenotype severity and complexity of management.
      Recurrence rates are high and younger siblings tend to be more severely affected.
      Detection of prenatal alcohol use warrants substance abuse intervention, which
      can avoid exposure in subsequent pregnancies. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
      are common developmental disorders with a phenotype that is influenced by both
      age and development and require long-term management. Child neurologists are
      essential in the diagnosis and management of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

TI  - Callosal thickness reductions relate to facial dysmorphology in fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders.
PG  - 798-806
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01679.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Structural abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC), such as reduced
      size and increased shape variability, have been documented in individuals with
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the regional specificity of
      altered CC structure, which may point to the timing of neurodevelopmental
      disturbances and/or relate to specific functional impairments, remains unclear.
      Furthermore, associations between facial dysmorphology and callosal structure
      remain undetermined. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-three participants (age range
      8 to 16) including 82 subjects with FASD and 71 nonexposed controls were included
      in this study. The structural magnetic resonance imaging data of these subjects
      was collected at 3 sites (Los Angeles and San Diego, California, and Cape Town,
      South Africa) and analyzed using classical parcellation schemes, as well as more 
      refined surface-based geometrical modeling methods, to identify callosal
      morphological alterations in FASD at high spatial resolution. RESULTS: Reductions
      in callosal thickness and area, specifically in the anterior third and the
      splenium, were observed in FASD compared with nonexposed controls. In addition,
      reduced CC thickness and area significantly correlated with reduced palpebral
      fissure length. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous reports, findings suggest
      an adverse effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on callosal growth and further
      indicate that fiber pathways connecting frontal and parieto-occipital regions in 
      each hemisphere may be particularly affected. Significant associations between
      callosal and facial dysmorphology provide evidence for a concurrent insult to
      midline facial and brain structural development in FASD.

TI  - Validation of the alcohol use module from a multidimensional prenatal
      psychosocial risk screening instrument.
PG  - 1791-800
LID - 10.1007/s10995-011-0926-2 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the study was to validate the Prenatal Risk Overview (PRO) Alcohol
      use domain against a structured diagnostic interview. The PRO was developed to
      screen for 13 psychosocial risk factors associated with poor birth outcomes.
      After clinic staff administered the PRO to prenatal patients, they asked for
      consent to administration of selected modules of the structured clinical
      interview for DSM-IV (SCID) by a research assistant. To assess the criterion
      validity of the PRO, low and moderate/high risk classifications from the alcohol 
      use domain were cross-tabulated with SCID Alcohol Use Disorder variables. The
      study sample included 744 women. Based on PRO responses, 48.7% reported alcohol
      use during the 12 months before they learned they were pregnant; 5.4% reported
      use post pregnancy awareness. The typical quantity consumed pre-pregnancy was
      four or more drinks per occasion. Based on the SCID, 7.4% met DSM-IV criteria for
      either Alcohol Abuse or Dependence. Sensitivity and specificity of the PRO for
      Alcohol Use Disorders were 83.6 and 80.3%, respectively. Negative predictive
      value was 98.4% and positive predictive value was 25.3%. The results indicate the
      PRO effectively identified pregnant women with Alcohol Use Disorders. However,
      prenatal screening must also detect consumption patterns that do not meet
      diagnostic thresholds but may endanger fetal development. The PRO also identified
      women who continued to drink after they knew they were pregnant, as well as those
      whose previous drinking habits put them at risk for resumption of hazardous use.

TI  - Towards improved alcohol prevention in Swedish antenatal care?
PG  - 314-20
LID - 10.1016/j.midw.2011.04.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate an education effort and revised alcohol-preventive routine
      in Swedish antenatal care; to generate more knowledge for further development of 
      alcohol issues in antenatal care. DESIGN: two national cross-sectional surveys of
      Swedish midwives were conducted. Baseline data were collected in 2006 and
      follow-up data in 2009. SETTING: antenatal care centres in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 
      974 midwives in 2006 and 1108 midwives in 2009. MEASUREMENT: amount and content
      of continuing professional education, work with alcohol-related issues,
      identification of women with risky consumption of alcohol, and action after
      identifying women with risky consumption. FINDINGS: the amount of continuing
      professional education undertaken by midwives on handling risky drinking
      increased significantly between 2006 and 2009. The routine to detect risky
      drinking changed between the baseline and follow-up data collection, as nearly
      all midwives reported the use of an alcohol screening questionnaire in 2009. The 
      most confident midwives in 2009 had taken part in more days of education, more
      often stated it was their own initiative to participate, and had more often taken
      part in education regarding MI, provision of advice and information on the health
      risks associated with alcohol and, screening. KEY CONCLUSIONS: our results
      indicate that a broad, national education effort can be successful in enhancing
      knowledge and changing antenatal care practice. However, generalisation to other 
      countries or cultures may be limited because the usage of new routines is
      affected by many organisational and contextual factors.

      exposure].
PG  - 324-8
LID - 10.1016/j.anpedi.2011.09.016 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ethanol consumption by pregnant women can produce severe effects in
      the foetus and the newborn, mainly in neurological and weight-height development,
      and are included in the term FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder).
      Questionnaires are the most used screening method to detect prenatal exposure,
      but a previous population study questioned its reliability. The objective of this
      study was to compare alcohol prenatal exposure detection by questionnaire
      compared with biomarkers in meconium. METHODOLOGY: Sixty two meconium samples
      from mothers who denied alcohol consumption during pregnancy by questionnaire
      were analysed. The objective analysis was made by determination of FAEEs (fatty
      acid ethyl esters) as exposure biomarkers in meconium as biological matrix.
      RESULTS: In the meconium from 10 of 62 newborns from non-alcohol consuming
      mothers by questionnaire (16.12%) FAEE values were positive (>/= 2 nmol/g).
      DISCUSSION: Questionnaires as a screening method during pregnancy are not a
      reliable tool. It is necessary to identify prenatal exposure to alcohol as soon
      as possible by biomarkers analysis in biological matrices from the newborn or the
      mother. The early detection will allow these patients to benefit from follow up
      and treatment to reach the best possible neurological development.

TI  - Developmental delay of infants and young children with and without fetal alcohol 
      spectrum disorder in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa.
PG  - 298-305
LID - http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/ajpsy.v14i4.7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the extent and nature of developmental delay at different 
      stages in childhood in a community in South Africa, with a known high rate of
      Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). METHOD: cohort of infants, clinically
      examined for FASD at two time periods, 7-12 months (N= 392; 45 FASD) and 17-21
      months of age (N = 83, 35 FASD) were assessed using the Griffiths Mental
      Developmental Scales (GMDS). RESULTS: Infants and children with FASD perform
      worse than their Non-FASD counterparts over all scales and total developmental
      quotients. Mean quotients for both groups decline between assessments across
      subscales with a particularly marked decline in the hearing and language scale at
      Time 2 (scores dropping from 110.6 to 83.1 in the Non-FASD group and 106.3 to
      72.7 in the FASD group; P = 0.004). By early childhood the developmental gap
      between the groups widens with low maternal education, maternal depression, high 
      parity and previous loss of sibling/s influencing development during early
      childhood. CONCLUSION: The FASD group show more evidence of developmental delay
      over both time points compared to their Non-FASD counterparts. Demographic and
      socio-economic factors further impact early childhood. These findings are
      important in setting up primary level psycho-educational and national prevention 
      programmes especially in periurban communities with a focus on early childhood
      development and FASD.

TI  - Universal prevention is associated with lower prevalence of fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders in Northern Cape, South Africa: a multicentre before-after
      study.
PG  - 67-74
LID - 10.1093/alcalc/agr145 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is remarkably high
      in several provinces of South Africa; yet population-level knowledge of the harms
      of maternal drinking remains low. In two heavily affected areas, we assessed
      effectiveness of interventions to heighten awareness of these harms and to alter 
      social norms about drinking in pregnancy. METHODS: FASD prevalence, maternal
      knowledge and drinking behaviours were investigated in two Northern Cape Province
      towns, before and after interventions which included highlighting FASD using
      local media and health promotion talks at health facilities. Independently, two
      dysmorphologists and a neuropsychometrist examined children at 9 and 18 months.
      RESULTS: Pre-intervention maternal knowledge of alcohol harms was low and FASD
      prevalence 8.9% (72/809). Interventions reached high coverage and knowledge
      levels increased substantially. FASD prevalence was 5.7% post-intervention
      (43/751; P = 0.02); 0.73 lower odds, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity
      (95% confidence interval = 0.58-0.90). No change was detected in more severe FASD
      forms, but in the whole population, median dysmorphology scores reduced from 4
      [inter-quartile range (IQR) = 2-7] to 3 (IQR = 1-6; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: This,
      the first prevention study using FASD outcomes, suggests that universal
      prevention might reduce FASD by approximately 30% and have population-level
      effects. This supports intensifying universal interventions where knowledge of
      harms of maternal drinking is low. These efforts need to be accompanied by
      alcohol-dependence treatment to lower more severe FASD forms.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder prevalence estimates in correctional systems: a
      systematic literature review.
PG  - 336-40
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic search of the
      literature for studies that estimated the prevalence/incidence of Fetal Alcohol
      Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in correctional systems in different countries and,
      based on these data, to estimate a) the number of people with Fetal Alcohol
      Syndrome (FAS)/FASD within the criminal justice system population, and b) the
      relative risk of becoming imprisoned for individuals with FAS/FASD compared with 
      those without FAS/FASD. METHOD: A systematic world literature review of published
      and unpublished studies concerning the prevalence/incidence of FASD in
      correctional systems was conducted in multiple electronic bibliographic
      databases. SYNTHESIS: Very little empirical evidence is available on the
      prevalence of FASD in correctional systems. There were no studies estimating the 
      prevalence/incidence of FASD in correctional systems found for any country other 
      than Canada and the USA. The few studies that have identified incarcerated
      individuals with FASD estimate that the number of undiagnosed persons in
      correctional facilities is high. Based on available Canadian data, this study
      estimates that youths with FASD are 19 times more likely to be incarcerated than 
      youths without FASD in a given year. CONCLUSION: More studies investigating the
      prevalence/incidence of alcohol-affected people in the criminal justice system
      are required. There is an urgent need to raise awareness about the prevalence and
      disabilities of individuals with FASD in the criminal justice system and about
      appropriate responses. The criminal justice system is an ideal arena for
      intervention efforts aimed at the rehabilitation and prevention or reduction of
      recidivism in this unique population.

      on social skills deficits in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure,
      including individuals with and without fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).
      RESULTS: Social deficits are found in alcohol-exposed children, adults, and
      adolescents with and without a clinical presentation. These deficits tend to
      persist across the lifespan and may even worsen with age. Social deficits in this
      population appear to be independent of facial dysmorphology and IQ and are worse 
      than can be predicted based on atypical behaviors alone. Abnormalities in
      neurobiology, executive function, sensory processing, and communication likely
      interact with contextual influences to produce the range of social deficits
      observed in FASD. CONCLUSIONS: Future investigations should strive to reconcile
      the relationship between social skills deficits in FASD and variables such as
      gender, age, cognitive profile, and structural and functional brain impairments
      to enable better characterization of the deficits observed in this population,
      which will enhance diagnosis and improve remediation.

TI  - The benefits and harms of alcohol use in New Zealand: what politicians might
      consider.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - The New Zealand Government is currently considering ways to reduce
      alcohol-related harm, following on from a detailed report by the Law Commission. 
      To inform discussions we briefly summarise the benefits and harms of alcohol use 
      in this country. The most substantive benefits to society are probably pleasure
      to users and economic benefits (largely to industry). The most substantive harms 
      are probably those to mental and physical health, harm to society (e.g. from
      crime) and adverse net economic impacts. Overall the picture is suggestive that
      New Zealand society would be likely to achieve a large net benefit from reducing 
      heavy and binge drinking, and shifting alcohol consumption towards a pattern of
      smaller amounts. The substantial harm to non-users is a key argument for
      democratic governments to use regulations and taxes to minimise harm from
      alcohol.

AB  - The knowledge of the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy isn't indeed
      a new issue, but the recent evidences of ethyl-glucuronide and ethyl-sulfate in
      meconium as novel biomarkers of prenatal ethanol exposure open new perspectives
      for the early diagnosis of the alcohol-related birth defects. This is crucial for
      a better developmental outcome of the affected patients and for preventing
      additional cases in at risk families. The fetal alcohol syndrome is not a single 
      entity but represents the most severe form of a spectrum of disorders, including 
      distinctive craniofacial alterations, stunted growth and behavioral
      abnormalities, caused by complex gene-environment interactions. FAS must always
      be a diagnosis of exclusion and have to be differentiated from many conditions
      caused by other embryotoxin agents and genetic syndromes that share some
      phenotypic features. Even if the first trimester is considered the most
      vulnerable period, nowadays is known that a fetal damage might occur throughout
      all gestation. Since ethanol consumption is constantly increasing among young
      women, a substantial amount of work has to be made to implement the knowledge on 
      alcohol fetal effects among women of childbearing age; moreover, awareness and
      training among professionals in the health care system might play a critical role
      in the early diagnosis of these serious conditions.

TI  - [Alcoholic foetopathy: an update].
PG  - S53-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years a great deal of attention has been given to the
      role of prenatal exposure to alcohol in the production of a wide range of
      disorders known as foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Foetal alcohol
      syndrome represents the classic syndrome and the most serious manifestation
      caused by the epigenetic changes induced by such exposure. It is considered to be
      the number one preventable cause of congenital defects and mental deficiency.
      AIM: To update the body of knowledge on this group of disorders by reviewing the 
      most important aspects in terms of the epidemiology, diagnostic criteria and
      treatment, with special emphasis on the associated cognitive and behavioural
      alterations. DEVELOPMENT: The worldwide prevalence of alcohol spectrum disorders 
      could be around 1%. Today there are a number of diagnostic systems available for 
      FASD. The most commonly used are the diagnostic criteria of the Institute of
      Medicine. The cognitive and behavioural alterations cover a wide range of
      disorders that are associated to the psychosocial environment in which the child 
      develops. The executive functions are usually found to be affected and most
      patients associate attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Few studies have
      been conducted on the effectiveness of treatments such as methylphenidate or
      atomoxetine in this population. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to know the
      clinical, physical and cognitive manifestations of intrauterine exposure to
      alcohol. Likewise, randomised placebo-controlled randomised studies are needed to
      estimate the effectiveness of psychostimulants and atomoxetine in the treatment
      of these children.

PG  - 1170-9
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhr193 [doi]
AB  - Accumulating evidence from structural brain imaging studies on individuals with
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has supported links between prenatal
      alcohol exposure and brain morphological deficits. Although global and regional
      volumetric reductions appear relatively robust, the effects of alcohol exposure
      on cortical thickness and relationships with facial dysmorphology are not yet
      known. The structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 69 children and
      adolescents with FASD and 58 nonexposed controls collected from 3 sites were
      examined using FreeSurfer to detect cortical thickness changes across the entire 
      brain in FASD and their associations with facial dysmorphology. Controlling for
      brain size, subjects with FASD showed significantly thicker cortices than
      controls in several frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Analyses conducted
      within site further revealed prominent group differences in left inferior frontal
      cortex within all 3 sites. In addition, increased inferior frontal thickness was 
      significantly correlated with reduced palpebral fissure length. Consistent with
      previous reports, findings of this study are supportive of regional increases in 
      cortical thickness serving as a biomarker for disrupted brain development in
      FASD. Furthermore, the significant associations between thickness and dysmorphic 
      measures suggest that the severity of brain anomalies may be reflected by that of
      the face.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a wide range of
      neurocognitive effects. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC), which involves temporal
      pairing of a conditioned with an unconditioned stimulus, has been shown to be a
      potential biomarker of fetal alcohol exposure. A growing body of evidence
      suggests that white matter may be a specific target of alcohol teratogenesis, and
      the neural circuitry underlying EBC is known to involve the cerebellar peduncles.
      Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique
      that has proven useful for assessing central nervous system white matter
      integrity. This study used DTI to examine the degree to which the fetal
      alcohol-related deficit in EBC may be mediated by structural impairment in the
      cerebellar peduncles. METHODS: Thirteen children with fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorder (FASD) and 12 matched controls were scanned using DTI and structural MRI
      sequences. The DTI data were processed using a voxelwise technique, and the
      structural data were used for volumetric analyses. Prenatal alcohol exposure
      group and EBC performance were examined in relation to brain volumes and outputs 
      from the DTI analysis. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and perpendicular
      diffusivity group differences between alcohol-exposed and nonexposed children
      were identified in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. Alcohol exposure
      correlated with lower FA and greater perpendicular diffusivity in this region,
      and these correlations remained significant even after controlling for total
      brain and cerebellar volumes. Conversely, trace conditioning performance was
      related to higher FA and lower perpendicular diffusivity in the left middle
      peduncle. The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on trace conditioning was
      partially mediated by lower FA in this region. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends
      recent findings that have used DTI to reveal microstructural deficits in white
      matter in children with FASD. This is the first DTI study to demonstrate
      mediation of a fetal alcohol-related effect on neuropsychological function by
      deficits in white matter integrity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High numbers of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders
      (FASD) have been described as having mental health problems. AIMS: This article
      summarizes research about mental health problems in FASD and considers related
      developmental and environmental issues. METHOD: A computer-based literature
      search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Academic
      Search Complete, and Education Resources Information Centre for articles
      addressing the prevalence and types of mental health issues in individuals
      affected by FASD. RESULTS: High rates of mental disorders within the FASD and
      prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) population were found to be consistently reported
      for both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Moreover, problems that
      emerge in childhood may reflect a convergence of genetic, environmental, and
      neurophysiological factors that persist into adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers 
      are beginning to document the impacts of PAE on later mental health development. 
      Further longitudinal study is needed to determine whether there is an increasing 
      severity of mental health deficits and consequences with age, and whether any
      such changes reflect increasingly deteriorating environmental factors or
      brain-based factors. Additionally, research is needed to design interventions to 
      better address the unique mental health needs of this population.

TI  - Prevalence of children with severe fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in
      communities near Rome, Italy: new estimated rates are higher than previous
      estimates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the population-based epidemiology of fetal alcohol
      syndrome (FAS) and other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in towns
      representative of the general population of central Italy. METHODS: Slightly
      revised U.S. Institute of Medicine diagnostic methods were used among children in
      randomly-selected schools near Rome. Consented first grade children (n=976) were 
      screened in Tier I for height, weight, or head circumference and all
      children</=10th centile on one of these measurements were included in the study. 
      Also, teachers referred children for learning or behavioral problems. Children
      meeting either of these two criteria, along with randomly-selected controls,
      advanced to Tier II which began with a dysmorphology examination. Children with a
      possible FASD, and controls, advanced to Tier III for neurobehavioral testing,
      and their mothers were interviewed for maternal risks. Final diagnoses using
      indicators of dysmorphology, neurobehavior, and maternal risk were made in
      formally-structured, interdisciplinary case conferences. RESULTS: Case control
      comparisons of physical, neurobehavioral, and maternal risk variables are
      presented for 46 children with an FASD and 116 randomly-selected controls without
      a diagnosis on the FASD continuum. Rates of diagnoses within the FASD continuum
      are then estimated from these in-school data via three different methods. The
      range of rates of FAS produced by these methods is between 4.0 to 12.0 per 1,000;
      Partial FAS ranges from 18.1 to 46.3 per 1,000; and an FASD was found in 2.3% to 
      6.3% of the children. CONCLUSIONS: These rates are substantially higher than
      previous estimates of FAS and overall FASD for the general populations of Western
      Europe and the U. S., and raise questions as to the total impact of FASD on
      mental deficit in mainstream populations of Western Europe and the United States 
      where the majority are middle class and are not believed to be characterized by
      heavy episodic drinking.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evolution of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
      prevention practices including awareness and use of recently published tools.
      METHODS: Fellows of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were 
      asked about their knowledge, opinions, and practice regarding alcohol-related
      care. Eight hundred obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) were selected; 48.1%
      returned the survey. RESULTS: The majority (66.0%) indicated that occasional
      alcohol consumption is not safe during any period of pregnancy. There was no
      consensus when asked if alcohol's effect on fetal development is clear (46.9%
      thought it was clear and 45.9% did not). Most (82.2%) ask all pregnant patients
      about alcohol use only during patients' initial visit, whereas 10.6% ask during
      initial and subsequent visits. Most (78.5%) advise abstinence when pregnant women
      report alcohol use. When asked which validated alcohol risk screening tool they
      most commonly use with pregnant patients, 57.8% said they use no tool. Although
      71.9% felt prepared to screen for risky or hazardous drinking, older ob-gyns
      indicated feeling significantly more unprepared than younger ob-gyns. "Patient
      denial or resistance to treatment" was the top issue affecting alcohol screening 
      and "referral resources for patients with alcohol problems" was the resource
      needed most. Most ob-gyns were not aware of the National Institute on Alcohol
      Abuse and Alcoholism "Clinician's Guide" or the American College of Obstetricians
      and Gynecologists "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Prevention Tool Kit."
      CONCLUSIONS: There are few changes in the alcohol-related screening and treatment
      patterns of ob-gyns since 1999; although perceived barriers and needs have
      changed. Interventions, including referral resources and continuing medical
      education training, are warranted.

TI  - Women's alcohol consumption and risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies in Russia.
PG  - 109-17
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03569.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) are the direct cause of fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD). This study examines drinking patterns among pregnant
      and non-pregnant women of childbearing age in Russia, a country with one of the
      highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world. DESIGN: Cross-sectional
      survey. SETTING: Seven public women's clinics in two locations: St Petersburg
      (SPB) and the Nizhny Novgorod region (NNR). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 648 pregnant
      and non-pregnant childbearing-age women. MEASUREMENTS: A face-to-face structured 
      interview assessed alcohol consumption, pregnancy status/possibility of becoming 
      pregnant and consumption before and after pregnancy recognition. FINDINGS:
      Eighty-nine per cent of non-pregnant women reported consuming alcohol and 65%
      reported binge drinking in the past 3 months; 47% in NNR and 28% in SPB reported 
      binges at least monthly. Women who might become pregnant consumed alcohol
      similarly to women who were not likely to become pregnant, and 32% of women in
      SPB and 54% in NNR were categorized as at risk for AEP. There was a significant
      decline in drinking after pregnancy identification. Twenty per cent of pregnant
      women reported consuming alcohol and 6% in SBP (none in NNR) reported binge
      drinking; however, a high prevalence of binge drinking was found among women who 
      might become pregnant or who were trying to conceive. CONCLUSIONS: Russian women 
      substantially reduce drinking after pregnancy recognition compared to
      pre-pregnancy levels. No reductions were found prior to pregnancy recognition,
      either when a woman might become pregnant or when she was trying to conceive. The
      pre-conception period presents a risk window and, therefore, a prevention
      opportunity.

TI  - Pregnancy, alcohol intake, and intimate partner violence among men and women
      attending drinking establishments in a Cape Town, South Africa township.
PG  - 208-16
LID - 10.1007/s10900-011-9438-7 [doi]
AB  - The highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome worldwide can be found in South
      Africa. Particularly in impoverished townships in the Western Cape, pregnant
      women live in environments where alcohol intake during pregnancy has become
      normalized and interpersonal violence (IPV) is reported at high rates. For the
      current study we sought to examine how pregnancy, for both men and women, is
      related to alcohol use behaviors and IPV. We surveyed 2,120 men and women
      attending drinking establishments in a township located in the Western Cape of
      South Africa. Among women 13.3% reported being pregnant, and among men 12.0%
      reported their partner pregnant. For pregnant women, 61% reported attending the
      bar that evening to drink alcohol and 26% reported both alcohol use and currently
      experiencing IPV. Daily or almost daily binge drinking was reported twice as
      often among pregnant women than non-pregnant women (8.4% vs. 4.2%). Men with
      pregnant partners reported the highest rates of hitting sex partners, forcing a
      partner to have sex, and being forced to have sex. High rates of alcohol
      frequency, consumption, binge drinking, consumption and binge drinking were
      reported across the entire sample. In general, experiencing and perpetrating IPV 
      were associated with alcohol use among all participants except for men with
      pregnant partners. Alcohol use among pregnant women attending shebeens is
      alarmingly high. Moreover, alcohol use appears to be an important factor in
      understanding the relationship between IPV and pregnancy. Intensive, targeted,
      and effective interventions for both men and women are urgently needed to address
      high rates of drinking alcohol among pregnant women who attend drinking
      establishments.

AB  - The study investigated prenatal alcohol consumption and knowledge of alcohol
      risks and fetal alcohol syndrome among Korean women. The participants were 221
      Korean women who attended the post-partum care centers in Seoul, Korea. The data 
      included the participants' background characteristics, quantity-frequency
      typology, Student Alcohol Questionnaire, and a scale on the participants'
      knowledge of fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol was consumed during pregnancy by
      12.7% of the participants. Of these, 60.7% drank alcohol with their spouse. A few
      participants reported that nurses identified their drinking habits and gave them 
      information on alcohol consumption and fetal alcohol syndrome. Most of the
      participants did not have the opportunity for prenatal counseling about fetal
      alcohol syndrome. The knowledge level regarding alcohol risks and fetal alcohol
      syndrome among the participants was poor. Alcohol consumption before pregnancy
      was significantly related to prenatal alcohol consumption. Prenatal alcohol
      consumption was not related to knowledge about alcohol consumption and fetal
      alcohol syndrome. The assessment of alcohol consumption and counseling about
      alcohol are needed for pregnant women in order to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: a population based study of premature mortality
      rates in the mothers.
PG  - 1332-7
LID - 10.1007/s10995-011-0844-3 [doi]
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are associated with an increase in risk
      for mortality for people with an FASD and their siblings. In this study we
      examine mortality rates of birth mothers of children with FASD, using a
      retrospective case control methodology. We utilized the North Dakota FASD
      Registry to locate birth certificates for children with FASD which we used to
      identify birth mothers. We then searched for mothers' death certificates. We then
      compared the mortality rates of the birth mothers with an age matched control
      group comprised of all North Dakota women who were born and died in the same year
      as the birth mother. The birth mothers of children with FASD had a mortality rate
      of 15/304 = 4.93%; (95% CI 2.44-7.43%). The mortality rate for control mothers
      born in same years as the FASD mothers was 126/114,714 = 0.11% (95% CI
      0.09-0.13%). Mothers of children with an FASD had a 44.82 fold increase in
      mortality risk and 87% of the deaths occurred in women under the age of 50. Three
      causes of death (cancer, injuries, and alcohol related disease) accounted for 67%
      of the deaths in the mothers of children with FASD. A diagnosis of FASD is an
      important risk marker for premature death in the mothers of children diagnosed
      with an FASD. These women should be encouraged to enter substance abuse
      treatment.

TI  - Developmental cortical thinning in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - 16-25
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.026 [doi]
AB  - Regional cortical thickness was evaluated using CIVET processing of 3D
      T1-weighted images (i) to compare the variation in cortical thickness between 33 
      participants with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) aged 6-30 years (mean
      age 12.3 years) versus 33 age/sex/hand-matched controls, and (ii) to examine
      developmental changes in cortical thickness with age from children to young
      adults in both groups. Significant cortical thinning was found in the
      participants with FASD in large areas of the bilateral middle frontal lobe, pre- 
      and post- central areas, lateral and inferior temporal and occipital lobes
      compared to controls. No significant cortical thickness increases were observed
      for the FASD group. Cortical thinning with age in a linear model was observed in 
      both groups, but the locations were different for each group. FASD participants
      showed thinning with age in the left middle frontal, bilateral precentral,
      bilateral precuneus and paracingulate, left inferior occipital and bilateral
      fusiform gyri; while controls showed decreases with age in the bilateral middle
      frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precuneus gyrus, and
      bilateral occipital gyrus. A battery of cognitive assessments of memory,
      attention, motor, and verbal abilities was conducted with many of the FASD
      participants, but no significant correlations were found between these cognitive 
      scores and regional cortical thickness. Non-invasive measurements of cortical
      thickness in children to young adults with FASD have identified both key regions 
      of cortex that may be more deleteriously affected by prenatal alcohol exposure as
      well as cortical changes with age that differ from normal developmental thinning.

TI  - Sleep and sensory characteristics in young children with fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorder.
PG  - 384-92
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0b013e3182199694 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: : Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a syndrome that results
      from prenatal alcohol exposure and is defined by significant neurobehavioral
      impairments. Sleep disruption has been recognized as a clinically important
      symptom of FASD that has multiple negative effects on the child's health, ability
      to function adaptively, as well as on family and caregivers. However, few studies
      have addressed and characterized the sleep problems in this population.
      OBJECTIVE: : The objective of this study was to characterize sleep in FASD and
      describe the impact of sensory processing difficulties on sleep patterns in
      children with FASD. METHODS: : Children with FASD were compared with age-matched 
      typically developing children between 3 and 6 years of age. Sleep was assessed
      using actigraphy, a sleep log, and the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire. The
      Sensory Profile, completed by caregivers, was used to evaluate the child's
      sensory processing abilities. Overall differences in sensory processing were
      correlated with actigraphic parameters measured in alcohol exposed and control
      groups. RESULTS: : Data show that children with FASD have significantly more
      sleep disturbances than typically developing children, including increased
      bedtime resistance, shortened sleep duration, increased sleep anxiety, and
      increased night awakenings and parasomnias. Actigraphy reveals a significant
      difference between groups for sleep onset latency. CONCLUSIONS: : This study
      demonstrates that sensory processing deficits are widespread in children with
      FASD and that these deficits are associated with multiple sleep problems.
      Children with FASD should be screened for sleep-related disorders and would
      benefit from occupational therapy for sensory-based treatment aimed at sleep
      regulation and consolidation.

TI  - Birth Outcomes, Lifetime Alcohol Dependence and Cognition in Middle Adulthood.
LID - 1000102 [pii]
AB  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with cognitive abnormalities that
      persist throughout the lifespan and are also often a focus of studies examining
      cognitive outcomes associated with excessive alcohol use by an individual. This
      study examined the effect of birth outcomes consistent with fetal alcohol
      exposure on associations between lifetime alcohol dependence and cognition in
      middle adulthood. The sample was comprised of 315 adult adoptees ranging in age
      from 31 to 64 years (SD = 7.20). Facial morphology, pre-morbid cognition, and
      current cognition were assessed. Birth parent behaviors and birth outcomes (e.g.,
      birthweight, gestational age) were obtained from adoption agency records.
      Lifetime alcohol dependence was determined from the Semi-Structured Assessment of
      the Genetics of Alcoholism - II. Univariate associations showed significantly
      poorer pre-morbid and current cognition when birth parent problems, short
      palpebral fissures, and thin upper lips were present. Lifetime alcohol dependence
      was associated with lower perceptional organization, processing speed and working
      memory. Multivariate analyses demonstrated continued significance suggesting
      unique contributions of each to cognition. Evaluating the possible role of fetal 
      alcohol exposure within studies on alcoholism can only further improve the
      treatment and prevention of alcohol-related problems by isolating those cognitive
      outcomes uniquely attributable to an individual's consumption of alcohol.

LID - 10.1097/FCH.0b013e31821962a8 [doi]
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, the most common preventable cause for mental
      retardation, is the result of prenatal alcohol exposure. There is no safe amount 
      of alcohol during pregnancy. Native Americans have a higher risk of alcohol abuse
      than the general U.S. population. The fetal alcohol spectrum disorders prevalence
      rates for Native Americans range from 1.0 to 8.97 per 1000 births. Nurses and
      health care providers working in collaboration with tribal fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders prevention specialists can greatly, and positively, impact the physical
      and mental health and well-being of children in Native American communities.

TI  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy among women in Israel.
PG  - e261-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a range of disabilities
      caused by gestational exposure of the fetus to alcohol. Alcohol consumption in
      Israel has increased dramatically in the last decades. Our previous study
      revealed limited knowledge among Israeli medical professionals of the risks and
      potential long-term effects of FASD. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the awareness and
      knowledge of women regarding the current recommendations on alcohol consumption
      during pregnancy, evaluate how many of the women received information regarding
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy from medical professionals, and their
      personal drinking habits during pregnancy. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of
      new mothers in 3 large hospitals in Israel were asked to complete an ad hoc
      questionnaire on aspects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. RESULTS: A
      total of 3815 women of mean age 30.4 years participated in the study; 82% were
      Jewish. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported by 14.1%, including
      more than 17% of the Jewish women, 11.1% of the Christian women, and none of the 
      Muslim women. Rates were higher among nonsecular and younger women and first-time
      mothers. 71.6% of the sample claimed that women should not drink alcohol at all
      during pregnancy, and 21.4% thought that it was permissible if limited to 2
      drinks per week. Seventy-five percent had received no formal information from
      medical professionals regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption is frequent among pregnant women in Israel,
      especially young secular Jewish women with first pregnancies. Improved
      educational programs on the dangers of FASD are needed for both professionals and
      the general public.

AB  - AIM: To examine risk and protective factors associated with behavioural problems 
      of children and adolescents following prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: A total
      of 73 children and adolescents with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were
      assessed for internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems using
      the Child Behavior Checklist. Linear regression models were used to determine the
      effects of diagnostic and environmental risk and protective factors on behaviour,
      while controlling for age, sex and IQ. RESULTS: Length of time spent in
      residential care was the most pervasive risk factor associated with
      internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems. A low dysmorphology 
      score was related to more internalizing and total problems. CONCLUSIONS: Children
      and adolescents prenatally exposed to alcohol faced greater risk of substantive
      behavioural problems (i) if they were less visibly alcohol affected and (ii) the 
      longer time they had spent in residential care. The results underscore the
      clinical importance of appropriate services and care for less visibly affected
      children with FASD and highlight the need to attend to children with FASD being
      raised in institutions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Step by Step
      program in which mentors work with parents affected by Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorder (FASD) on a one-to-one basis. Mentors help clients identify and work
      towards meeting their needs and achieving their goals. Data from 24 closed client
      files was collected and analyzed and as predicted, the program was effective in
      helping clients reduce their needs and achieve their goals. The clients' reason
      for leaving the program as well as whether or not they had a formal FASD
      diagnosis had an impact on their success in the program. Data collected on
      additional mental health issues, experience of abuse and addictions helped to
      characterize the sample of clients and correlations were found between clients'
      experience of abuse and their past and/or present addictions issues. Limitations 
      of this study as well as future implications were also discussed.

      upon physical parameters including facial anomalies and growth retardation, with 
      evidence of developmental delay or mental deficiency. Forty years of research has
      shown that FAS lies towards the extreme end of what are now termed fetal alcohol 
      spectrum disorders (FASD). The most profound effects of prenatal alcohol exposure
      are on the developing brain and the cognitive and behavioral effects that ensue. 
      Alcohol exposure affects brain development via numerous pathways at all stages
      from neurogenesis to myelination. For example, the same processes that give rise 
      to the facial characteristics of FAS also cause abnormal brain development.
      Behaviors as diverse as executive functioning to motor control are affected. This
      special issue of Neuropsychology Review addresses these changes in brain and
      behavior highlighting the relationship between the two. A diagnostic goal is to
      recognize FAS as a disorder of brain rather than one of physical characteristics.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging offers the opportunity to understand the effect of
      prenatal alcohol exposure on the activities of the brain as well as providing a
      window into the relationship between neural activation and the behavioral
      outcomes that have been described in affected individuals. Several different
      methodologies have been used to examine the neurophysiological signal changes
      associated with different brain functions in prenatally exposed individuals and
      those diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or other fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD). These include electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission
      tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These studies demonstrate that it
      is feasible to use these technologies with this clinical population and that the 
      damage to the central nervous system associated with prenatal alcohol exposure
      has widespread functional implications; however, currently, the literature in
      these areas is limited and unsystematic. Functional MRI with this clinical
      population has just begun to explore the implications of prenatal alcohol
      exposure with the first paper published in 2005. Other methodologies are
      similarly limited in scope. Nonetheless, these functional neuroimaging studies
      suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure, or a diagnosis of FAS, may lead to
      restrictions in neural efficiency or a global decrement in processing resources.

TI  - [Awareness and knowledge about risks of drinking during pregnancy in pregnant
      Lebanese women].
PG  - 94-100

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the awareness and knowledge of pregnant Lebanese women about
      the risks of drinking during pregnancy and the factors that influence their
      drinking patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on a 
      sample of 107 women consulting the gynecology outpatient department of Hotel-Dieu
      de France in Beirut, Lebanon, who completed the T-ACE screening test included in 
      a 21 multiple choice questionnaire which examine knowledge and beliefs about
      alcohol use during pregnancy, drinking patterns and awareness of fetal alcohol
      exposure. RESULTS: The 107 women of our sample were all married, between 20 and
      41 years old and had mostly a high educational level (86%). Most of the women
      (47%) were at their first pregnancy. Of the 20 women who self-reported drinking
      during pregnancy, 60% obtained a positive score on the T-ACE questionnaire, which
      indicates that more than 11% of the women engaged with potentially high risk
      drinking for the baby. There is not a significant difference between the
      different age categories or educational levels. This proportion is lower than
      that found in international publications. However, the rate of excessive drinking
      (4 drinks or more on any one occasion in females) was higher and one woman in
      five reported excessive drinking in the previous year. There is a high level of
      knowledge that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the child, and the more
      consumption the more harmful and likely the effects, but there is confusion about
      the safety of small amounts of alcohol. Women (37%) think that there is a safe
      level of drinking during pregnancy; 29% tolerate up to one drink a month, 9%
      tolerate up to one drink a week and one woman thinks having one drink a day is
      safe. Women who actually drink during pregnancy are more likely to think that
      alcohol consumption to a certain level is safe. Women (31%) think that beer
      and/or wine are safe alcohols to a certain level during pregnancy. When asked
      about the source of this belief, 22% mention a gynecologist but the majority
      (61%) says it is a personal belief. Women (65%) in our sample are aware that
      alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to life-long disabilities in a child, such 
      as delayed development (36%), birth defects/deformities (35%) and mental
      retardation (32%). However, up to 33% of the respondents report having no
      information about the effects of alcohol on the fetus and two women believe
      alcohol is not harmful at all. Women with lower levels of education are somewhat 
      less knowledgeable about the risks of alcohol use during pregnancy than those
      with higher levels of education. There is no association between the drinking
      patterns of the women with their age, their professional habits and the alcohol
      consumption of their husbands. The women in our sample seem to be more aware of
      the necessity to stop smoking rather than stop drinking during pregnancy.
      CONCLUSION: Lebanese women are not fully aware of the recommendations and risks
      related to drinking during pregnancy. This is the reason why action must be taken
      to ensure better diffusion of these recommendations and better assessment of
      alcohol intake during prenatal visits.

TI  - Co-regulation of movement speed and accuracy by children with heavy prenatal
      alcohol exposure.
PG  - 172-82
AB  - The study investigated how children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure regulate
      movement speed and accuracy during goal-directed movements. 16 children ages 7 to
      17 years with confirmed histories of heavy in utero alcohol exposure, and 21
      nonalcohol-exposed control children completed a series of reciprocal tapping
      movements between two spatial targets. 5 different targets sets were presented,
      representing a range of task difficulty between 2 and 6 bits of information.
      Estimates of percent error rate, movement time, slope, and linear fit of the
      resulting curve confirmed that for goal-directed, reciprocal tapping responses,
      performance of the group with prenatal alcohol exposure was described by a linear
      function, as predicted by Fitts' law, by sacrificing movement accuracy. The index
      of performance was the same for the two groups: it initially increased, then
      leveled off for more difficult movements.

PG  - 920-37
LID - 10.1002/hbm.21260 [doi]
AB  - Individuals with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure can experience significant
      deficits in cognitive and psychosocial functioning and alterations in brain
      structure that persist into adulthood. In this report, data from 99 participants 
      collected across three sites (Los Angeles and San Diego, California, and Cape
      Town, South Africa) were analyzed to examine relationships between brain
      structure, neurocognitive function, facial morphology, and maternal reports of
      quantities of alcohol consumption during the first trimester. Across study sites,
      we found highly significant volume reductions in the FASD group for all of the
      brain regions evaluated. After correcting for scan location, age, and total brain
      volume, these differences remained significant in some regions of the basal
      ganglia and diencephalon. In alcohol-exposed subjects, we found that smaller
      palpebral fissures were significantly associated with reduced volumes in the
      ventral diencephalon bilaterally, that greater dysmorphology of the philtrum
      predicted smaller volumes in basal ganglia and diencephalic structures, and that 
      lower IQ scores were associated with both smaller basal ganglia volumes and
      greater facial dysmorphology. In subjects from South Africa, we found a
      significant negative correlation between intracranial volume and total number of 
      drinks per week in the first trimester. These results corroborate previous
      reports that prenatal alcohol exposure is particularly toxic to basal ganglia and
      diencephalic structures. We extend previous findings by illustrating
      relationships between specific measures of facial dysmorphology and the volumes
      of particular subcortical structures, and for the first time show that continuous
      measures of maternal alcohol consumption during the first trimester relates to
      overall brain volume reduction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have deficits
      in verbal learning and recall. However, the specificity of these deficits has not
      been adequately tested. In the current study, verbal learning and memory
      performance of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was compared to
      children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a disorder
      commonly seen in alcohol-exposed children. METHODS: Performance on the California
      Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C) was examined in 3 groups of
      children (N=22/group): (i) heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD (ALC), (ii)
      nonexposed with ADHD (ADHD), and (iii) nonexposed typically developing (CON).
      Groups were matched on age, sex, race, ethnicity, handedness, and socioeconomic
      status (SES). RESULTS: Group differences were noted on learning trials (CON
      >ADHD> ALC). On the delayed recall trial, CON children performed better than both
      clinical groups, who did not differ from each other. Children in the ALC group
      demonstrated poorer recognition than children in the CON and ADHD groups, who did
      not differ from each other. Marginally significant group differences were noted
      on retention of previously learned material. Post hoc analyses indicated that
      ADHD children showed worse retention relative to the CON group, whereas retention
      in the ALC children remained intact. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that
      children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and nonexposed children with ADHD
      show differential patterns of deficit on the CVLT-C. Performance of
      alcohol-exposed children reflects inefficient encoding of verbal material,
      whereas performance of the ADHD group may be better characterized by a deficit in
      retrieval of learned material. Differences noted between clinical groups add to a
      growing neurobehavioral profile of FASD that may aid in differential diagnosis.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure has numerous effects on the developing brain, including
      damage to selective brain structure. We review structural magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) studies of brain abnormalities in subjects prenatally exposed to
      alcohol. The most common findings include reduced brain volume and malformations 
      of the corpus callosum. Advanced methods have been able to detect shape,
      thickness and displacement changes throughout multiple brain regions. The
      teratogenic effects of alcohol appear to be widespread, affecting almost the
      entire brain. The only region that appears to be relatively spared is the
      occipital lobe. More recent studies have linked cognition to the underlying brain
      structure in alcohol-exposed subjects, and several report patterns in the
      severity of brain damage as it relates to facial dysmorphology or to extent of
      alcohol exposure. Future studies exploring relationships between brain structure,
      cognitive measures, dysmorphology, age, and other variables will be valuable for 
      further comprehending the vast effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and for
      evaluating possible interventions.

      and an IQ-matched comparison group.

AB  - An objective in current research on children with fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD) is to determine neurobehavioral profiles to identify affected
      individuals. Deficits observed when children with FASD are compared to typically 
      developing controls may be confounded by lower IQ scores in the subjects with
      FASD. To determine if prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with
      neurobehavioral deficits after controlling for IQ differences, multivariate
      analyses were conducted to compare alcohol-exposed (ALC) subjects to a comparison
      group closely matched on IQ (IQC). The initial analysis included a broad
      neuropsychological battery with measures of language, executive function,
      visual-motor integration, motor ability, and academic achievement. Additional, in
      depth comparisons focused on visual sustained attention, verbal learning and
      memory and parent/guardian-reported behavior problems. Group differences (ALC <
      IQC) were found on verbal learning and parent-rated behavior problems. Group
      differences were marginally significant (measures within the broad
      neuropsychological comparison) or not significant (visual attention, retention of
      verbal material) on the remaining comparisons. Therefore, some deficits (e.g.,
      verbal learning and behavior problems) in children with heavy prenatal alcohol
      exposure cannot be explained by the lower FSIQ observed in the population. These 
      areas of relative weakness could be useful in distinguishing children with FASD
      from other children with lowered IQ.

      alcohol exposure.
PG  - 849-61

AB  - BACKGROUND: MRI studies, including recent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies,
      have shown corpus callosum abnormalities in children prenatally exposed to
      alcohol, especially in the posterior regions. These abnormalities appear across
      the range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have
      demonstrated cognitive correlates of callosal abnormalities in FASD including
      deficits in visual-motor skill, verbal learning, and executive functioning. The
      goal of this study was to determine whether inter-hemispheric structural
      connectivity abnormalities in FASD are associated with disrupted
      inter-hemispheric functional connectivity and disrupted cognition. METHODS:
      Twenty-one children with FASD and 23 matched controls underwent a 6-minute
      resting-state functional MRI scan as well as anatomical imaging and DTI. Using a 
      semi-automated method, we parsed the corpus callosum and delineated 7
      inter-hemispheric white matter tracts with DTI tractography. Cortical regions of 
      interest (ROIs) at the distal ends of these tracts were identified. Right-left
      correlations in resting fMRI signal were computed for these sets of ROIs, and
      group comparisons were made. Correlations with facial dysmorphology, cognition,
      and DTI measures were computed. RESULTS: A significant group difference in
      inter-hemispheric functional connectivity was seen in a posterior set of ROIs,
      the para-central region. Children with FASD had functional connectivity that was 
      12% lower than in controls in this region. Subgroup analyses were not possible
      owing to small sample size, but the data suggest that there were effects across
      the FASD spectrum. No significant association with facial dysmorphology was
      found. Para-central functional connectivity was significantly correlated with DTI
      mean diffusivity, a measure of microstructural integrity, in posterior callosal
      tracts in controls but not in FASD. Significant correlations were seen between
      these structural and functional measures, and Wechsler perceptual reasoning
      ability. CONCLUSIONS: Inter-hemispheric functional connectivity disturbances were
      observed in children with FASD relative to controls. The disruption was measured 
      in medial parietal regions (para-central) that are connected by posterior
      callosal fiber projections. We have previously shown microstructural
      abnormalities in these same posterior callosal regions, and the current study
      suggests a possible relationship between the two. These measures have clinical
      relevance as they are associated with cognitive functioning.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is a cause of congenital brain malformations such as
      hydrocephalus; however, a complete mechanism accounting for this phenomenon has
      yet to be discovered. We report a case of a newborn who was exposed to alcohol
      throughout pregnancy and presented with low serum vitamin A and hydrocephalus. To
      our knowledge, the connection between prenatal ethanol exposure, vitamin A
      deficiency, and a developmental brain anomaly has never been described in humans 
      before. A possible mechanism may be mediated by disruption of the homeostasis of 
      vitamin A, an important morphogen in the developing nervous system. This, in
      turn, compromises the activity of the floor plate, a structure in charge of
      polarization and midline formation in the neural tube. We conclude that vitamin A
      screening and supplementation might be recommended for newborns of mothers who
      ingested ethanol during pregnancy.

AB  - Conceptualizations of risks related to women's alcohol use during pregnancy, and 
      the attendant response to preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), are 
      examined in six countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Uganda,
      Uruguay, and China. Considerable differences were found in how risks were
      conceptualized across countries and in contextual factors that influence
      research, prevention, and intervention efforts. Differences in conceptualizations
      were also apparent within countries. Differences also existed in the degree to
      which the issue of drinking during pregnancy has been minimized or amplified and 
      in whether and how responses are linked to treatment or other public health
      interventions.

AB  - In addition to fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,
      prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with many other adverse pregnancy and
      birth outcomes. Research suggests that alcohol use during pregnancy may increase 
      the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and sudden infant death
      syndrome. This research has some inherent difficulties, such as the collection of
      accurate information about alcohol consumption during pregnancy and controlling
      for comorbid exposures and conditions. Consequently, attributing poor birth
      outcomes to prenatal alcohol exposure is a complicated and ongoing task,
      requiring continued attention to validated methodology and to identifying
      specific biological mechanisms.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: experimental treatments and strategies for
      intervention.
PG  - 76-85
AB  - Despite the known damaging effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, women continue
      to drink during pregnancy, creating a need for effective interventions and
      treatments for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Experimental models can
      be useful in identifying potential treatments, and this article describes the
      spectrum of experimental therapeutics that currently are being investigated,
      including pharmacological, nutritional, and environmental/behavioral
      interventions. Some treatments target the underlying mechanisms that contribute
      to alcohol-induced damage, protecting against alcohol's teratogenic effects,
      whereas other treatments may enhance central nervous system plasticity either
      during alcohol exposure or long after alcohol exposure has ceased. The insights
      gained to date from experimental models offer several candidates for attenuating 
      the deficits associated with FASD.

TI  - The quest for a neurobehavioral profile of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 51-5
AB  - The devastating consequences of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) are well
      established, and, as a leading cause of intellectual disabilities (Pulsifer
      1996), FAS has significant societal and public health implications. Importantly, 
      FAS is associated with a broad range of neurobehavioral deficits (for more
      information, see the article by Coles, pp. 42-50 in this issue). However, FAS is 
      only the most serious possible consequence of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure,
      and many individuals who do not meet diagnostic criteria for FAS also are
      severely impacted by gestational alcohol exposure. The term fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD) is used to encompass a spectrum of effects that
      includes FAS towards the extreme end as well as conditions such as
      alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth
      defects (ARBD). The term ARND (Hoyme et al. 2005) refers to individuals who,
      after heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, exhibit neurobehavioral effects without
      meeting the physical criteria for FAS (for a review, see Vaurio et al. 2010).
      Clinical identification of this group of individuals is hampered precisely
      because they do not exhibit the external physical features of FAS, and the
      existing physiological biomarkers for gestational alcohol exposure have several
      limitations. Determination of a profile based on the neurobehavioral effects of
      heavy prenatal alcohol exposure would allow more accurate identification of
      affected individuals. To be clear, development of such a profile is aimed at
      identifying and characterizing those who are affected by prenatal alcohol
      exposure, not simply those who have been exposed to alcohol prenatally.

TI  - Understanding the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure using three-dimensional
      facial imaging.
PG  - 38-41
AB  - One of the (at least theoretically) most easily detectable features of fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a distinct 
      pattern of facial characteristics. However, in many children prenatally exposed
      to alcohol, these characteristics are expressed only subtly, making it difficult 
      to correctly identify children with these disorders. To date, several studies
      have used conventional two-dimensional images to develop computerized programs
      assisting in the identification of individuals with FAS or FASD. However, many of
      the subtle features of prenatal alcohol exposure cannot be visualized using
      two-dimensional images. Therefore, researchers at the Collaborative Initiative on
      Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD; http://www.cifasd.org) have been using 
      a special camera system that can generate three-dimensional images, which allows 
      them to explore the advantages of using such images to identify subtle facial
      differences between individuals who were exposed to alcohol prenatally and
      individuals who were not. This approach may help investigators and clinicians to 
      better understand the complications that may arise from prenatal alcohol
      exposure. For example, CIFASD researchers can use facial measurements or shapes
      obtained from the three-dimensional images to predict the presence of FAS,
      examine associations between facial shapes and cognitive deficiencies, or better 
      understand how the facial growth of a person with FAS compares with facial growth
      in someone not prenatally exposed to alcohol. Through an international
      consortium, CIFASD has been addressing these questions in various age groups as
      well as different ethnic groups.

TI  - Focus on: epigenetics and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - 29-37
AB  - Epigenetic changes-stable but potentially reversible alterations in a cell's
      genetic information that result in changes in gene expression but do not involve 
      changes in the underlying DNA sequence-may mediate some of the detrimental
      effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and contribute to the deficits and
      abnormalities associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. These epigenetic 
      processes are linked to the chromatin (i.e., DNA, histone proteins, and other
      associated proteins) and commonly involve chemical modifications (e.g.,
      methylation) of these molecules, which may result in altered expression of the
      affected genes. Even alcohol exposure prior to conception appears to be able to
      induce epigenetic changes in the parental genetic material that can be passed on 
      to the offspring and affect offspring outcome. Similarly, epigenetic processes
      may occur as a result of maternal alcohol consumption during the period between
      fertilization of the egg and implantation in the uterus. The period most
      sensitive to alcohol's adverse effects appears to be gastrulation, which
      corresponds to prenatal weeks 3 to 8 in the human and prenatal days 7 to 14 in
      the mouse, when cells are differentiating to form organs. One way in which
      alcohol exposure may induce epigenetic changes, particularly abnormal DNA
      methylation, is by affecting a set of biochemical reactions called the
      methionine-homocysteine cycle.

TI  - Alcohol use and pregnancy consensus clinical guidelines.
PG  - S1-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to establish national standards of care for the screening and
      recording of alcohol use and counselling on alcohol use of women of child-bearing
      age and pregnant women based on the most up-to-date evidence. EVIDENCE: published
      literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane
      Library in May 2009 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., pregnancy
      complications, alcohol drinking, prenatal care) and key words (e.g., pregnancy,
      alcohol consumption, risk reduction). Results were restricted to literature
      published in the last five years with the following research designs: systematic 
      reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational 
      studies. There were no language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular 
      basis and incorporated in the guideline to May 2010. Grey (unpublished)
      literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology
      assessment (HTA) and HTA-related agencies, national and international medical
      specialty societies, clinical practice guideline collections, and clinical trial 
      registries. Each article was screened for relevance and the full text acquired if
      determined to be relevant. The evidence obtained was reviewed and evaluated by
      the members of the Expert Workgroup established by the Society of Obstetricians
      and Gynaecologists of Canada. The quality of evidence was evaluated and
      recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task 
      Force on Preventive Health Care. VALUES: the quality of evidence was rated using 
      the criteria described by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care
      (Table 1). SPONSOR: the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Society of
      Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. ENDORSEMENT: these consensus
      guidelines have been endorsed by the Association of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists of Quebec; the Canadian Association of Midwives; the Canadian
      Association of Perinatal, Women's Health and Neonatal Nurses (CAPWHN); the
      College of Family Physicians of Canada; the Federation of Medical Women of
      Canada; the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada; and Motherisk. SUMMARY
      STATEMENTS: 1. There is evidence that alcohol consumption in pregnancy can cause 
      fetal harm. (II-2) There is insufficient evidence regarding fetal safety or harm 
      at low levels of alcohol consumption in pregnancy. (III) 2. There is insufficient
      evidence to define any threshold for low-level drinking in pregnancy. (III) 3.
      Abstinence is the prudent choice for a woman who is or might become pregnant.
      (III) 4. Intensive culture-, gender-, and family-appropriate interventions need
      to be available and accessible for women with problematic drinking and/or alcohol
      dependence. (II-2). RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Universal screening for alcohol
      consumption should be done periodically for all pregnant women and women of
      child-bearing age. Ideally, at-risk drinking could be identified before
      pregnancy, allowing for change. (II-2B) 2. Health care providers should create a 
      safe environment for women to report alcohol consumption. (III-A) 3. The public
      should be informed that alcohol screening and support for women at risk is part
      of routine women's health care. (III-A) 4. Health care providers should be aware 
      of the risk factors associated with alcohol use in women of reproductive age.
      (III-B) 5. Brief interventions are effective and should be provided by health
      care providers for women with at-risk drinking. (II-2B) 6. If a woman continues
      to use alcohol during pregnancy, harm reduction/treatment strategies should be
      encouraged. (II-2B) 7. Pregnant women should be given priority access to
      withdrawal management and treatment. (III-A) 8. Health care providers should
      advise women that low-level consumption of alcohol in early pregnancy is not an
      indication for termination of pregnancy. (II-2A).

      Cape Town, South Africa.
PG  - 83-90

AB  - South Africa has the highest prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders
      (FASDs) in the world. The purpose of this study was to identify high risk factors
      associated with drinking alcohol prior to pregnancy recognition in 24
      neighborhoods in the Cape Flats outside Cape Town, South Africa. An interviewer
      assessed risk among 619 pregnant Black/African women between the ages of 18 and
      41 years. Logistic regression analyses explored factors associated with drinking 
      alcohol post conception but prior to pregnancy recognition. Forced multiple
      logistic regression analysis revealed that drinking prior to pregnancy
      recognition was associated with being younger, single, having better living
      conditions, smoking, having a longer gestation prior to pregnancy recognition,
      having a greater number of sexual partners, and a higher incidence of intimate
      partner violence. Depressive symptoms tended to be higher among alcohol users.
      These risk factors were consistent with other research on the characteristics of 
      South African women having children with a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorders and/or of non pregnant women at high risk for an alcohol-exposed
      pregnancy. These findings highlight the need for women of child-bearing age to be
      routinely screened for alcohol use and its associated risk factors. Intervention 
      efforts could be integrated into health initiatives already present in South
      Africa including the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and
      malnutrition. Preconception care is particularly important since pregnancy
      recognition often occurs several weeks to months following conception and could
      be implemented by South African community health workers. These endeavors should 
      facilitate national goals of healthier pregnancies and the elimination of FASDs
      in South Africa.

PG  - 69-82

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although an extensive literature has documented a broad range of
      cognitive performance deficits in children with prenatal alcohol exposure, little
      is known about how the neurophysiological processes underlying these deficits may
      be affected. Event-related potentials (ERPs), which reflect task-specific changes
      in brain electrical activity, provide a method for examining multiple
      constituents of cognitive processing at the neural level. METHODS: We recorded
      ERPs in 217 children from Inuit communities in Arctic Quebec (M age = 11.3 years)
      during 2 different tasks-Go/No-go response inhibition and continuous recognition 
      memory. Children were classified as either alcohol-exposed (ALC) or controls
      (CON) depending on whether the mother reported binge drinking during pregnancy.
      RESULTS: Both groups performed comparably in terms of accuracy and reaction time 
      on the tasks, and both tasks elicited the expected effects on ERPs when responses
      were compared across conditions. However, the ALC group showed slower P2
      latencies on Go/No-go, suggesting an altered neurophysiological response
      associated with initial visual processing of the stimuli. On the memory task, the
      ALC group showed reduced FN400 amplitude to New items, known as the familiarity
      effect, and reduced amplitude for the late positive component, possibly
      reflecting impairment in memory retrieval. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that,
      even in tasks in which alcohol-exposed children exhibit behavioral performance
      that is comparable to controls, fetal alcohol exposure is associated with altered
      neurophysiological processing of response inhibition and recognition memory. The 
      data suggest that fetal alcohol exposure is associated with reduced efficiency in
      the initial extracting of the meaning of a stimulus, reduced allocation of
      attention to the task, and poorer conscious, explicit recognition memory
      processing.

TI  - Infant Symbolic Play as an Early Indicator of Fetal Alcohol-Related Deficit.
PG  - 586-607
AB  - Infant symbolic play was examined in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure and
      socioenvironmental background and to predict which infants met criteria for fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS) at 5 years. 107 Cape Coloured, South African infants born 
      to heavy drinking mothers and abstainers/light drinkers were recruited
      prenatally. Complexity of play, socio-demographic and psychological correlates of
      maternal alcohol use, and quality of parenting were assessed at 13 months, and IQ
      and FAS diagnosis at 5 years. The effect of drinking on spontaneous play was not 
      significant after control for social environment. By contrast, prenatal alcohol
      and quality of parenting related independently to elicited play. Elicited play
      predicted 5-year Digit Span and was poorer in infants subsequently diagnosed with
      FAS/partial FAS and in nonsyndromal heavily exposed infants, compared with
      abstainers/light drinkers. Thus, symbolic play may provide an early indicator of 
      risk for alcohol-related deficits. The independent effects of prenatal alcohol
      and quality of parenting suggest that infants whose symbolic play is adversely
      affected by alcohol exposure may benefit from stimulation from a responsive
      caregiver.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Extending the range of structural defects.
PG  - 2731-5
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.33675 [doi]
AB  - Although the structural phenotype of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is established,
      prenatal exposure to alcohol may produce a broader spectrum of defects, fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Documenting the full spectrum of defects
      associated with FASD is critical to determining the true incidence of this
      disorder. We examined 831 children from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal
      Alcohol Spectrum Disorders using a structured protocol for diagnosis of FAS using
      the cardinal facial and growth features, and assessment of additional structural 
      defects thought to occur more often in children with prenatal alcohol exposure.
      Subjects were classified as FAS, Deferred (some characteristic features of FAS), 
      or No FAS, Groups were compared on prevalence of additional features and number
      of additional features observed, stratified by diagnostic category, sex, race,
      and age. Prevalence of most additional features was greatest among subjects with 
      FAS and least among No FAS. A higher frequency of additional features was
      observed among FAS and Deferred subjects >/=12 years of age than among those
      under 12. FAS and Deferred Whites had greater frequency of additional features
      than Cape Colored. Prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broad spectrum of
      structural defects that goes beyond FAS with implications regarding the impact of
      alcohol on the developing fetus, a prerequisite for ultimate prevention of FASD.

TI  - Does lack of multinutrient supplementation during early pregnancy increase
      vulnerability to alcohol-related preterm or small-for-gestational-age births?
PG  - 1324-32
LID - 10.1007/s10995-010-0690-8 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess whether women who do not take
      multinutrient supplements during early pregnancy are more susceptible to the
      effects of low-to-moderate alcohol consumption on preterm birth and
      small-for-gestational-age birth (SGA) compared to women who do take
      multinutrients. This analysis included 800 singleton live births to mothers from 
      a cohort of pregnant women recruited for a population-based cohort study
      conducted in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Northern California.
      Participants were recruited in their first trimester of pregnancy and information
      about their alcohol use and supplement intake during pregnancy was collected.
      Preterm birth (n=53, 7%) was defined as a delivery prior to 37 completed weeks of
      gestation and SGA birth (n=124, 16%) was defined as birth weight less than the
      10th percentile for the infant's gestational age and sex compared to US singleton
      live births. A twofold increase in the odds of SGA birth attributed to
      low-to-moderate alcohol intake was found among multinutrient supplement non-users
      (95% CI: 1.1, 5.3). Yet, among multinutrient supplement users, there was no
      increased risk of an SGA birth for women who drank low-to-moderately compared to 
      women who abstained (aOR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.6, 1.6). Similar results emerged for
      preterm birth. Our findings provide marginal evidence that multinutrient
      supplementation during early pregnancy may modify the risk of SGA births and
      preterm birth associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and may have
      important implications for pregnant women and women of child-bearing age.
      However, future research needs to be conducted.

PG  - A331
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure may cause decreased growth of the child, congenital
      abnormalities, specific facial characteristics, and, most importantly, mental
      retardation and behavioural disorders, all known as fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD). A significant number of pregnant women in the Netherlands drink
      alcohol, but the prevalence of FASD in our country is unknown. Repeated and high 
      peak blood alcohol concentrations, for example in the case of binge drinking by
      the mother, result in more severe abnormalities; a safe limit for alcohol
      consumption in pregnancy cannot be defined. In 2007 and 2008, Dutch
      paediatricians reported a total of 56 diagnosed cases of FASD, mostly adopted and
      foster children. Possibly the condition has not always been diagnosed. Use of
      international guidelines for diagnosis by the medical profession may improve
      detection. The guidelines of the Canadian Public Health Agency provide a useful
      and generally accepted classification, with strict cut-off points to avoid
      overdiagnosis; attention should always be paid to the broad differential
      diagnosis.

TI  - Distinguishing between attention-deficit hyperactivity and fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders in children: clinical guidelines.
PG  - 509-15
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the physical and neurodevelopmental
      outcomes of fetal alcohol exposure. The behavioral phenotype of children with
      FASD includes difficulties with executive function, memory, planning, processing 
      speed, and attention. Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is
      diagnosed in up to 94% of individuals with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, the
      exact relationship between FASD and ADHD is unclear. There is some evidence that 
      ADHD in FASD may be a specific clinical subtype and thus may require a different 
      treatment approach. Although traditional behavioral observation scales may not
      distinguish between the two groups, there is evidence that children with FASD
      have a different profile on the four-factor model of attention than children with
      ADHD who do not have FASD. There is a paucity of good scientific evidence on
      effective interventions for individuals with ADHD and FASD. There is weak
      evidence that children with FASD and ADHD may have a better response to
      dexamphetamine than methylphenidate. There is a strong need for larger, high
      quality studies to examine the relationship between ADHD and FASD and identify
      effective treatments because management of inattention and hyperactivity may
      improve learning and ameliorate the common secondary disabilities associated with
      FASD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to examine social skills deficits among
      children with and without prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) who were both referred 
      to a respite programme. METHODS: Thirty-seven children with PAE and 23
      non-exposed children (aged 3 to 8 years) were evaluated on the Social Skills
      Rating System (SSRS) by their caregivers and respite workers. RESULTS: As
      compared with the non-exposed children, those with PAE showed more deficits on
      caregiver ratings of responsibility, hyperactivity, internalizing problems and
      overall social skills, as well as respite worker ratings of hyperactivity. The
      social skills among the PAE group were not related to home placement variables.
      Among both groups, caregivers rated social skills lower than respite workers, and
      among the PAE group, girls tended to display more social skills deficits than
      boys. CONCLUSIONS: The SSRS is useful in identifying unique social skills
      deficits among children with PAE.

      screening for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/1747-597X-5-22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological distress (PD) includes symptoms of depression and
      anxiety and is associated with considerable emotional suffering, social
      dysfunction and, often, with problematic alcohol use. The rate of current PD
      among American Indian women is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of U.S.
      women in general. Our study aims to fill the current knowledge gap about the
      prevalence and characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported
      current drinking problems among American Indian mothers whose children were
      referred to screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). METHODS:
      Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data was conducted from maternal interviews
      of referred American Indian mothers (n = 152) and a comparison group of mothers
      (n = 33) from the same Plains culture tribes who participated in an NIAAA-funded 
      epidemiology study of FASD. Referred women were from one of six Plains Indian
      reservation communities and one urban area who bore children suspected of having 
      an FASD. A 6-item PD scale (PD-6, Cronbach's alpha = .86) was constructed with a 
      summed score range of 0-12 and a cut-point of 7 indicating serious PD. Multiple
      statistical tests were used to examine the characteristics of PD and its
      association with self-reported current drinking problems. RESULTS: Referred and
      comparison mothers had an average age of 31.3 years but differed (respectively)
      on: education (<high school: 47.4%, 9.1%), PD-6 mean scores (3.57, 1.48), current
      prevalence of serious PD (19.1%, 0.0%), and a current drinking problem (31.6%,
      12.1%). Among referred mothers, those with a current drinking problem had a
      significantly higher mean PD-6 score. Having PD, serious PD, and 2 specific scale
      items significantly increased the odds that a referred mother would have a
      current drinking problem. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress among referred
      mothers is significantly associated with having a self-reported drinking problem.
      FASD prevention requires multi-level prevention efforts that provide real
      opportunities for educational attainment and screening and monitoring of PD and
      alcohol use during the childbearing years. Mixed methods studies are needed to
      illuminate the social and cultural determinants at the base of the experience of 
      PD and to identify the strengths and protective factors of unaffected peers who
      reside within the same communities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We explored differences in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD)
      knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors across six groups of professionals in key
      position to provide primary and secondary prevention efforts (physicians,
      educators, correctional staff, social workers, public health nurses, and
      substance abuse counselors). METHODS: Achieving a 60.1% response rate, 2,292
      professionals returned surveys, providing data on basic knowledge of FAS,
      FASD-associated risks and cognitive deficits, and willingness to confront and
      recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women. RESULTS: Across groups, 
      findings revealed ample FASD knowledge and willingness to confront and recommend 
      treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women that increases as consumption
      becomes more frequent and severe. However, results revealed significant
      between-group differences data that provide valuable guidance for targeted future
      FASD education efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Public health initiatives regarding FASD
      have been effective in increasing knowledge among a broad range of professionals.
      However, between-group differences indicate the need for targeted,
      discipline-specific interventions. These differences highlight the need for all
      professional groups to provide a consistent public health message regarding
      maternal alcohol consumption.

TI  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy: evidence from Canadian Community Health Survey
      2007/2008.
PG  - e302-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy may cause many health problems for 
      the child, one of which is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Since FASD is 
      incurable, actions meant to prevent the occurrence of the disability by targeting
      drinking women become more important. Epidemiological data on drinking among
      pregnant women, including prevalence and determinants/risk factors, is essential 
      for designing and evaluating prevention programs. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the
      prevalence of drinking alcohol during pregnancy and examine the determinants of
      this behaviour. METHODS: Using the 2007/8 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)
      data, we estimated the weighted prevalence of women who drank alcohol during
      their last pregnancy by provinces. We used a weighted logistic regression to
      examine associations between drinking patterns, substance abuse behaviours,
      health-related and socio-demographic characteristics of the women, and the
      outcome variable. RESULTS: There were two main findings of this study. One was
      that the 2007/8 prevalence of drinking alcohol during pregnancy in ON, BC, and
      Canada was estimated at 5.4%, 7.2%, and 5.8%, respectively. The other was that
      the use of general practitioners (GP) or family physicians (FP) associated with a
      decreased risk of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. DISCUSSION: The results
      suggest that interventions that involve GP or FP and that increase the use of GP 
      or FP by pregnant women can be effective in reducing drinking alcohol during
      pregnancy.

      national survey.
PG  - 510
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-10-510 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol exposure in pregnancy is a common and modifiable risk factor 
      for poor pregnancy and child outcomes. Alcohol exposure in pregnancy can cause a 
      range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems in the child including the
      Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). In order to improve prevention
      strategies, we sought to describe the knowledge and attitudes of women of
      childbearing age regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its effects
      on the fetus. METHODS: We conducted a national cross-sectional survey via
      computer assisted telephone interview of 1103 Australian women aged 18 to 45
      years. Participants were randomly selected from the Electronic White Pages.
      Pregnant women were not eligible to participate. Quotas were set for age groups
      and a minimum of 100 participants per state to ensure a national sample
      reflecting the population. The questionnaire was based on a Health Canada survey 
      with additional questions constructed by the investigators. Descriptive
      statistics were calculated and logistic regression analyses were used to assess
      associations with participants' knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: Of women
      surveyed, 61.5% had heard about effects of alcohol on the fetus and 55.3% had
      heard of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Although 92.7% agreed alcohol can affect the
      unborn child, 16.2% did not agree that the disabilities could be lifelong. Most
      women agreed that pregnant women should not drink alcohol (80.2%) and 79.2%
      reported having negative feelings towards pregnant women drinking alcohol. Women 
      with higher education levels were more likely to know the effects of alcohol
      consumption in pregnancy (adjusted OR 5.62; 95% CI 3.20 to 9.87) but education
      level and knowledge were not associated with attitude. CONCLUSIONS: There was a
      disjunction between knowledge and attitudes towards alcohol consumption in
      pregnancy. These findings will assist in developing effective health promotion
      campaigns to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and subsequent fetal damage.

TI  - [Educational effects of a single distribution of a leaflet on alcohol and
      pregnancy among female university students].
PG  - 431-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the educational effects of a single leaflet distributed
      once without explanation of its content. METHODS: All the 58 seniors on a
      dietitian course and all the 81 students who took "health and nutrition" as their
      elective in a women's university in F Prefecture were recruited. They were
      assigned to intervention or control groups. Both groups were asked the following 
      choice questions in a baseline survey: "What do you think about alcohol drinking 
      during pregnancy?" "What do you suppose you yourself will do in the future?" and 
      "Do you know about the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)?" One month later, a leaflet 
      was distributed to the intervention group only. One week after the distribution, 
      a second questionnaire was administered to both groups. The leaflet and the two
      questionnaires were distributed and collected during class with the help of
      teaching staff. The leaflet was made by a NPO and it recommended stopping
      drinking when planning to become pregnant. RESULTS: The participation rate was
      83%. There were no significant associations between groups and grades, current
      drinking habit, and learning experience on this topic. Almost 80% of the
      intervention group read the leaflet. Change in their thinking about drinking
      during pregnancy before and after the intervention did not significantly differ
      between the two groups. Compared to 57 controls, 66 students who received the
      leaflet showed significant improved changes in their attitudes toward drinking
      during pregnancy and the knowledge about FAS. CONCLUSIONS: No significant change 
      in their thinking about drinking during pregnancy could be due to the fact that, 
      even before the intervention, nearly 80% of the students thought pregnant women
      must abstain from alcohol entirely. This might be related to the sample
      characteristics, since 75% of them were majoring in nutrition. The improvement in
      attitudes was considered to reflect the content of the leaflet. In the
      intervention group, the percentage of the students who chose the alternative of
      "I plan to stop drinking when I wish to get pregnant" increased as the leaflet
      recommended and more than half of them said they learned about FAS by this
      leaflet. To sum up, even a single distribution of a leaflet in a school setting
      had educational effects which improved attitude and knowledge. Since the current 
      sample seemed to have particular knowledge and interest in health, it is now
      necessary to examine effects of the same approach in the general population.

      occupational development.
PG  - 33-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0030-1261927 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes physical, cognitive
      and behavioural impairments in the child. Deficits are irreversible and persist
      into adulthood. It was the objective of this study to investigate the specific
      problems and challenges faced by young adults with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). 
      PATIENTS: We examined the biographical development and living situation of 60
      adult patients with FAS. In their childhood, all the patients had been diagnosed 
      with FAS in the Muenster University hospital. METHODS: Using a structured
      interview, we asked for the occupational career, health and social problems as
      well as the current living conditions of the patients. RESULTS: Most patients
      lived in dependent circumstances. The occupational development was characterized 
      by disruption and failure, and severe social problems were common in patients. 3 
      in 4 patients were victims of physical and sexual abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the 
      variety of impairments caused by prenatal alcohol exposure and the persisting
      inability to live independently, adults with FAS need intense care, support and
      assistance.

TI  - Lithium-mediated protection against ethanol neurotoxicity.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2010.00041 [doi]
AB  - Lithium has long been used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of
      manic-depressive (bipolar) disorder. Recent studies suggest that lithium has
      neuroprotective properties and may be useful in the treatment of acute brain
      injuries such as ischemia and chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis. One of the most important neuroprotective properties of
      lithium is its anti-apoptotic action. Ethanol is a neuroteratogen and fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are caused by maternal ethanol exposure during 
      pregnancy. FASD is the leading cause of mental retardation. Ethanol exposure
      causes neuroapoptosis in the developing brain. Ethanol-induced loss of neurons in
      the central nervous system underlies many of the behavioral deficits observed in 
      FASD. Excessive alcohol consumption is also associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff
      syndrome and neurodegeneration in the adult brain. Recent in vivo and in vitro
      studies indicate that lithium is able to ameliorate ethanol-induced
      neuroapoptosis. Lithium is an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)
      which has recently been identified as a mediator of ethanol neurotoxicity.
      Lithium's neuroprotection may be mediated by its inhibition of GSK3. In addition,
      lithium also affects many other signaling proteins and pathways that regulate
      neuronal survival and differentiation. This review discusses the recent evidence 
      of lithium-mediated protection against ethanol neurotoxicity and potential
      underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Goal-directed arm movements in children with fetal alcohol syndrome: a kinematic 
      approach.
PG  - 312-20
LID - 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2010.03142.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many studies have documented deficits in general motor
      functioning in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), few have employed
      detailed measurements to explore the specific nature of such disabilities. This
      pilot study explores whether three-dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis may
      generate increased knowledge of the effect of intrauterine alcohol exposure on
      motor control processes by detecting atypical upper-limb movement pattern
      specificity in children with FAS relative to typically developing (TD) children. 
      METHODS: Left and right arm and head movements during a sequential unimanual
      goal-directed precision task in a sample of children with FAS and in TD children 
      were registered by an optoelectronic tracking system (ProReflex, Qualisys Inc.). 
      RESULTS: Children with FAS demonstrated evidently poorer task performance
      compared with TD children. Additionally, analyses of arm movement kinematics
      revealed atypical spatio-temporal organization in the children with FAS. In
      general, they exhibited longer arm movement trajectories at both the proximal and
      distal level, faster velocities at the proximal level but slower at the distal
      level, and more segmented distal movements. Children with FAS also showed
      atypically augmented and fast head movements during the task performance.
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate neuromotor deficits and developmental delay in
      goal-directed arm movements because of prenatal alcohol exposure. It is suggested
      that 3D kinematic analysis is a valid technique for furthering the understanding 
      of motor control processes in children with FAS/fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
      A combination with relevant neuroimaging techniques in future studies would
      enable a more clear-cut interpretation of how atypical movement patterns relate
      to underlying brain abnormalities.

AB  - The present experiment assessed motor response programming and movement time in
      children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PEA). Alcohol-exposed
      children between the ages of 7 and 17 years were classified into two groups:
      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS: n=9) and children with PEA (PEA: n=19) but who did
      not have the defining characteristics of FAS. The FAS and PEA children were
      compared with non-alcohol-exposed children (NC: n=23) when completing two tasks: 
      a simple reaction time task (RT alone condition) and a reaction plus movement
      task (RT+Move condition). The movement involved responding to an imperative
      stimulus signal and depressing three target buttons in a set sequence.
      Participants completed 24 trials each for the RT alone and RT+Move response
      conditions. Results indicated no significant differences in performance among
      FAS, PEA, and NC groups during the RT alone condition. However, during the
      RT+Move condition, the FAS group produced significantly longer and more variable 
      RTs than the PEA and NC groups, which produced comparable RTs. The FAS group also
      produced significantly slower movement times when moving to all three targets,
      whereas movement time variability did not significantly differ as a function of
      group. The observed results indicate children with FAS experience deficits in
      response programming and movement time production.

AB  - Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are sensitive and specific biomarkers
      for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in pregnancy. We recently reported a 2.5%
      rate of FAEE positive meconium in a general population sample of infants born in 
      the region of Grey-Bruce, Ontario. Women in this region with high-risk
      pregnancies are transferred to a tertiary care facility in London, Ontario. The
      objective of this study was to determine, in a population-based sample, whether
      high-risk pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of in utero alcohol
      exposure. Grey-Bruce residents transferred to the high-risk obstetric unit of St.
      Joseph's Health Care in London, Ontario were identified and consented to this
      anonymous prevalence study. Meconium was collected and analyzed for FAEE using
      gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. The prevalence of FAEE positive
      meconium was compared with the population-based prevalence in the Grey-Bruce.
      Fifty meconium specimens were collected from August 1, 2006 to July 31, 2007.
      Fifteen (30%) specimens tested positive for FAEE. The results indicate that
      infants born in the high-risk obstetric unit had a 12-fold higher risk of
      screening positive for second and third trimester alcohol exposure compared with 
      infants born in the general population of Grey-Bruce (relative risk=12.04, 95%
      confidence interval=6.40-22.65, P<.0001). These results suggest that the
      high-risk pregnancies should be screened for PAE and followed-up for potential
      diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

TI  - Alcohol Use during Pregnancy and Related Risk Factors in Korea.
PG  - 86-92
LID - 10.4306/pi.2010.7.2.86 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The number of Korean women of childbearing age who drink alcohol and
      binge drink has increased remarkably in recent years. In the present study, we
      examined self-reported rates of alcohol use before and during pregnancy and
      identified maternal characteristics associated with drinking in pregnancy.
      METHODS: One thousand pregnant Korean women who visited the Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) completed a self-administered questionnaire
      that sought information on their demographic characteristics and incorporated
      features of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT)-C to investigate
      their use of alcohol, including binge drinking, during three time periods ("in
      the year before this pregnancy," "during this pregnancy," and "in the previous 30
      days"). RESULTS: Of these participants, 16.4% reported using alcohol during their
      pregnancy, 12.2% had used alcohol in the previous 30 days, and 1.7% reported
      binge drinking during their pregnancy. In the year before pregnancy, 77.1% had
      used alcohol, and 22.3% had binge drunk. The group using any amount of any
      alcohol during pregnancy showed a lower educational level, a lower rate of
      planned pregnancy, a lower level of knowledge relating to the risks of drinking
      alcohol during pregnancy, and a higher frequency of alcohol drinking in the year 
      before pregnancy when compared with the abstinent group. Low educational level
      and unplanned pregnancy were revealed to be significant risk factors for alcohol 
      consumption in pregnant women. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine any
      alcohol and binge alcohol drinking during pregnancy in Korea. Clinical attention 
      and monitoring system on alcohol use during pregnancy are necessary in Korea.

PG  - 1640-50

AB  - BACKGROUND: A primary goal of recent research is the development of
      neurobehavioral profiles that specifically define fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD), which may assist differential diagnosis or improve treatment.
      In the current study, we define a preliminary profile using neuropsychological
      data from a multisite study. METHODS: Data were collected using a broad
      neurobehavioral protocol from 2 sites of a multisite study of FASD. Subjects were
      children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and unexposed controls. The
      alcohol-exposed group included children with and without fetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS). From 547 neuropsychological variables, 22 variables were selected for
      analysis based on their ability to distinguish children with heavy prenatal
      alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls. These data were analyzed using latent 
      profile analysis (LPA). RESULTS: The results indicated that a 2-class model best 
      fit the data. The resulting profile was successful at distinguishing subjects
      with FAS from nonexposed controls without FAS with 92% overall accuracy; 87.8% of
      FAS cases and 95.7% of controls were correctly classified. The same analysis was 
      repeated with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure but without FAS and
      nonexposed controls with similar results. The overall accuracy was 84.7%; 68.4%
      of alcohol-exposed cases and 95% of controls were correctly classified. In both
      analyses, the profile based on neuropsychological variables was more successful
      at distinguishing the groups than was IQ alone. CONCLUSIONS: We used data from 2 
      sites of a multisite study and a broad neuropsychological test battery to
      determine a profile that could be used to accurately identify children affected
      by prenatal alcohol exposure. Results indicated that measures of executive
      function and spatial processing are especially sensitive to prenatal alcohol
      exposure.

LID - 10.1159/000313339 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to a wide range of adverse effects on a
      developing fetus. As a whole, these teratogenic outcomes are generally known as
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, the most severe of which is fetal alcohol
      syndrome (FAS). Clinically, children diagnosed with FAS vary greatly in their
      presentation of symptoms, likely due to the amount of alcohol and timing of
      exposure, as well as maternal and genetic influences. All these factors play a
      role in determining the mechanisms through which alcohol damages a developing
      brain, the details of which are still largely unknown. However, continuing
      research and recent developments have provided promising results that may lead to
      screening mechanisms and treatment therapies for children with FAS. Here we
      review the teratogenic effects of alcohol, strategies for detecting maternal
      alcohol consumption, identification of fetal biological markers, and prevention
      methods for FAS.

TI  - [New informative and prevention programs in Europe to reduce the risks associated
      to alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the appearance of Foetal Alcohol
      Spectrum Disorders].
PG  - 97-9
AB  - In the last 40 years a vast mass of clinical, epidemiological and experimental
      evidence has demonstrated that alcohol is a teratogenic agent and that its
      consumption during gestation can cause foetal death, malformations and cognitive 
      and behavioral dysfunctions in the exposed fetus. The most dramatic presentation 
      is the complete foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is observed in children born
      from heavy alcohol consuming mothers. FAS and of other fetal alcohol-related
      effects was reported in both USA and Europe in the middle 80 s. However, despite 
      these evidences, many European countries have largely forgotten or minimize the
      risks associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. Thirty years later, new
      epidemiological and clinical studies as well as new biomarkers of fetal-alcohol
      damage have identified high risk populations and have provided data demonstrating
      that significant number of women in the EU drink during pregnancy. In September
      of 2009, a conference on 'ALCOHOL AND PREGNANCY' was organized sponsored by the
      Swedish Presidency of the European Union, to discuss political interventions in
      the EU concerning this question. I briefly summarize here the discussions,
      presentations and the prevention programs of some European countries. The main
      conclusion of the conference was that we need more information and prevention
      programs to improve prevention of the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption
      during gestation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of fetal alcohol exposure during pregnancy 
      with child and adolescent behavioural development. DESIGN: The Western Australian
      Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study recruited 2900 pregnancies (1989-91) and the
      14-year follow up was conducted between 2003 and 2006. SETTING: Tertiary
      obstetric hospital in Perth, Western Australia. POPULATION: The women in the
      study provided data at 18 and 34 weeks of gestation on weekly alcohol intake: no 
      drinking, occasional drinking (up to one standard drink per week), light drinking
      (2-6 standard drinks per week), moderate drinking (7-10 standard drinks per
      week), and heavy drinking (11 or more standard drinks per week). Methods
      Longitudinal regression models were used to analyse the effect of prenatal
      alcohol exposure on Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) scores over 14 years,
      assessed by continuous z-scores and clinical cutoff points, after adjusting for
      confounders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Their children were followed up at ages 2, 5, 
      8, 10 and 14 years. The CBCL was used to measure child behaviour. RESULTS: Light 
      drinking and moderate drinking in the first 3 months of pregnancy were associated
      with child CBCL z-scores indicative of positive behaviour over 14 years after
      adjusting for maternal and sociodemographic characteristics. These changes in
      z-score indicated a clinically meaningful reduction in total, internalising and
      externalising behavioural problems across the 14 years of follow up. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our findings do not implicate light-moderate consumption of alcohol in pregnancy 
      as a risk factor in the epidemiology of child behavioural problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Number processing deficits are frequently seen in children exposed to
      alcohol in utero. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to
      examine the neural correlates of number processing in 15 right-handed, 8- to
      12-year-old children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS
      (PFAS) and 18 right-handed, age- and gender-matched controls from the Cape
      Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, using Proximity
      Judgment and Exact Addition tasks. RESULTS: Control children activated the
      expected fronto-parietal network during both tasks, including the anterior
      horizontal intraparietal sulcus (HIPS), left posterior HIPS, left precentral
      sulcus, and posterior medial frontal cortex. By contrast, on the Proximity
      Judgment task, the exposed children recruited additional parietal pathways
      involving the right and left angular gyrus and posterior cingulate/precuneus,
      which may entail verbally mediated recitation of numbers and/or subtraction to
      assess relative numerical distances. During Exact Addition, the exposed children 
      exhibited more diffuse and widespread activations, including the cerebellar
      vermis and cortex, which have been found to be activated in adults engaged in
      particularly challenging number processing problems. CONCLUSIONS: The data
      suggest that, whereas control children rely primarily on the fronto-parietal
      network identified in previous studies to mediate number processing, children
      with FAS/PFAS recruit a broader range of brain regions to perform these
      relatively simple number processing tasks. Our results are consistent with
      structural neuroimaging findings indicating that the parietal lobe is relatively 
      more affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and provide the first evidence for
      brain activation abnormalities during number processing in children with
      FAS/PFAS, effects that persist even after controlling statistically for group
      differences in total intracranial volume and IQ.

TI  - Midwives and pregnant women talk about alcohol: what advice do we give and what
      do they receive?
PG  - 489-96
LID - 10.1016/j.midw.2010.03.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)
      recently revised its guidelines for alcohol consumption during pregnancy and
      breast feeding, moving from a recommendation of minimising intake to one of
      abstinence. Women are potentially exposed to a variety of messages about alcohol 
      and pregnancy, including from the media and social contacts, and are likely to
      see midwives as the source of expert advice in understanding these contradictory 
      messages. OBJECTIVE: to explore the advice that midwives believe they give to
      pregnant women about alcohol consumption, and the advice that pregnant women
      believe they receive; the knowledge and attitudes of both groups regarding
      alcohol consumption and the consistency with the NHMRC guidelines; and the
      receptivity and comfort of both groups in discussing alcohol consumption in the
      context of antenatal appointments. DESIGN: individual semi-structured interviews 
      with midwives and pregnant women. SETTING: face-to-face interviews with midwives 
      and telephone interviews with pregnant women were conducted in two regional areas
      of New South Wales in 2008-2009. PARTICIPANTS: 12 midwives and 12 pregnant women.
      FINDINGS: midwives and pregnant women consistently agreed that conversations
      about alcohol are generally limited to brief screening questions at the first
      visit, and the risks are not discussed or explained (except for high-risk women).
      KEY CONCLUSIONS: both groups expressed comfort with the idea of discussing
      alcohol consumption, but lacked knowledge of the risk and recommendation, and it 
      appears that this opportunity to provide women with information is
      under-utilised. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: there is a need to provide midwives
      with accurate information about the risks of alcohol consumption during pregnancy
      and effective communication tools to encourage them to discuss the risks and
      recommendations with their patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this investigation were to determine the frequencies 
      of and associations between different neurodevelopmental disorders and to study
      the potential lasting effects of alcohol on children adopted from eastern Europe.
      METHODS: In a population-based, prospective, observational, multidisciplinary,
      cross-sectional, cohort study of 71 children adopted from eastern Europe,
      children were assessed 5 years after adoption, from pediatric,
      neuropsychological, and ophthalmologic perspectives. RESULTS: Fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders, that is, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS, and
      alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, were identified for 52% of
      children; FAS was found for 30%, partial FAS for 14%, and alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorders for 9%. Alcohol-related birth defects were found for
      11% of children, all of whom also were diagnosed as having FAS. Mental
      retardation or significant cognitive impairment was found for 23% of children,
      autism for 9%, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder for 51%, and
      developmental coordination disorder for 34%. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal alcohol spectrum 
      disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders were common in this long-term
      follow-up study of children adopted from orphanages in eastern Europe. Maternal
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy has long-lasting adverse effects, causing
      structural, behavioral, and cognitive damage despite a radically improved
      environment.

PG  - 1022-32
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01177.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure can have detrimental effects on a child's
      development of adaptive behaviors necessary for success in the areas of academic 
      achievement, socialization, and self-care. Sensory processing abilities have been
      found to affect a child's ability to successfully perform adaptive behaviors. The
      current study explored whether significant differences in sensory processing
      abilities, adaptive behavior, and neurocognitive functioning are observed between
      children diagnosed with partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), Alcohol-Related
      Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND), or children who were prenatally exposed to
      alcohol (PEA), but did not meet criteria for an FASD diagnosis. The influence of 
      IQ on adaptive behavior as well as further exploration of the relationship
      between sensory processing and adaptive behavior deficits among these children
      was also examined. METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted on some of the
      Short Sensory Profile (SSP) scores, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System--Second
      Edition (ABAS-II) scores, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale--Fourth
      Edition/Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence--Third Edition
      (WISC- IV/WPPSI-III) scores of 46 children between 3 and 14 years of age with
      pFAS, ARND, or who were PEA. RESULTS: Greater sensory processing deficits were
      found in children with a diagnosis of pFAS and ARND compared to those in the PEA 
      group. Children with an ARND diagnosis scored significantly worse on measures of 
      adaptive behavior than the PEA group. Children with pFAS scored significantly
      lower than children with ARND or PEA on perceptual/performance IQ. No correlation
      was found between IQ scores and adaptive behaviors across the FASD diagnostic
      categories. A significant positive correlation was found between SSP and ABAS-II 
      scores. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the diagnosis received under the FASD
      umbrella, functional difficulties that could not be observed using traditional
      measures of intelligence were found, supporting guidelines that a broad range of 
      standardized assessments be included when screening children for FASD.

TI  - Diagnosing fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: History, challenges and future
      directions.
PG  - 231-7
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is one of the most common preventable
      causes of developmental disability, and is currently one of the most pressing
      public health concerns in Canada. FASD refers to the range of physical, mental,
      behavioural and learning disabilities that an individual may acquire as a result 
      of maternal alcohol consumption. In the present paper, the history of the
      diagnostic approach to alcohol-related disorders over the past 35 years is
      reviewed. Research supporting the importance of early diagnosis for the long-term
      outcomes and management of individuals with FASD is presented, and challenges
      that have plagued efforts to efficiently diagnose individuals with FASD are
      discussed. Finally, the study reviews the future directions and implications
      regarding current diagnostic strategies.

      Diagnostic & Prevention Network.
PG  - e132-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: An interdisciplinary approach to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
      (FASD) diagnosis using rigorously defined diagnostic guidelines has been adopted 
      as best practice. Diagnostic clinics are being established worldwide. If these
      clinics are to successfully compete for limited health care dollars, it is
      essential to document their value. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives were to
      document the value of the largest and longest standing interdisciplinary FASD
      diagnostic program; the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic &
      Prevention Network (WA FAS DPN). Now in its 17th year of operation, the WA FAS
      DPN is a statewide network of diagnostic clinics all using the 4-Digit Diagnostic
      Code and contributing to a centralized electronic database. METHODS: The clinical
      database was used to generate comprehensive profiles of all patients evaluated
      for FASD from 1993-2005. These profiles were used to answer a multitude of
      clinical, research, and public health questions including: What is the demand for
      FASD diagnostic services, who is referred to the clinics, and what are their FASD
      diagnostic outcomes? Can FAS/D prevalence estimates from this clinical population
      be used to estimate FAS/D prevalence estimates in the general population? Do FASD
      diagnostic outcomes vary by race, age or alcohol exposure? Does the presence of
      other adverse exposures/events lead to more severe outcomes? Does this approach
      to diagnosis meet the needs of families? RESULTS: Demand for diagnosis remains
      very high. Of 1,400 patients (newborn to adult) with confirmed prenatal alcohol
      exposure, 11% were diagnosed with FAS/PFAS, 28% with static encephalopathy, 52%
      with neurobehavioral disorder, and 9% with no evidence of CNS abnormality. FASD
      outcomes varied significantly by age, race, gender, alcohol exposure, and
      presence of other risk factors. Families reported high satisfaction with the
      diagnostic process, and receipt of information/services they were unable to
      obtain elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: This report documents the immense contribution of 
      a statewide FASD diagnostic program, and underscores the extraordinary value of a
      comprehensive FASD clinical dataset.

PG  - 897-906

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in adulthood are 
      not well documented. Questions persist regarding the extent to which there are
      specific, measurable effects beyond those associated with global ability
      deficits, whether individuals without the full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
      demonstrate alcohol-related cognitive impairments, and whether observed memory
      effects are specific to a particular modality, i.e., verbal vs. visual/spatial
      domains. METHODS: In this study, verbal and nonverbal selective reminding
      paradigms were used to assess memory function in 234 young adults (M age: 22.78, 
      SD: 1.79). Alcohol exposure was quantified prenatally. Alcohol groups included:
      Individuals with physical effects of alcohol exposure (Dysmorphic group, n = 47);
      Exposed individuals without such effects (n = 74). Contrast groups included:
      Controls (n = 59) matched for ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and hospital of
      birth; Special Education contrast group (n = 54) included to control for
      disability status. Memory outcomes entailed total recall, delayed recall, and
      measures of encoding and retrieval, and learning over trials as indexed by slope.
      RESULTS: Results indicated that Dysmorphic individuals were significantly less
      efficient in memory performance than Controls on all of the outcomes measured,
      but they did not differ from those in the Special Education contrast group. The
      nondysmorphic, alcohol-exposed group was intermediate in their performance,
      suggesting a continuum of effects of prenatal exposure. Evaluation of the
      encoding and retrieval aspects of memory performance indicated that learning
      rather than forgetting accounted for the deficits associated with prenatal
      alcohol exposure. Finally, no interaction was found between modality of
      presentation (verbal and nonverbal) and effects of alcohol exposure on memory
      performance. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure
      is associated with persistent and specific effects on memory performance, and
      these problems result from less efficient encoding of information across both
      verbal and nonverbal modalities. Education and training efforts with this
      clinical group should take these characteristics into account.

      evaluation study.
PG  - 2469-77
LID - 10.1007/s00216-010-3474-5 [doi]
AB  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) were determined in 602
      meconium samples in a maternal health evaluation study for detection of
      gestational alcohol consumption. A validated headspace solid phase
      microextraction method in combination with GC-MS was used for FAEE and the
      cumulative concentration of ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl oleate, and
      ethyl stearate with a cut-off of 500 ng/g was applied for interpretation. A new
      and simple method was developed and validated for quantification of EtG from
      10-20 mg meconium with D(5)-EtG as internal standard consisting of 30 min.
      extraction with methanol/water (1:1, v/v), evaporation of methanol, filtration of
      the aqueous solution through a cellulose filter and injection into LC-MS-MS. The 
      limits of detection and quantification for EtG were 10 and 30 ng/g, the recovery 
      86.6 to 106.4% and the standard deviation of the concentrations ranged from 13%
      at 37 ng/g to 5% at 46,700 ng/g (N = 6). FAEE above the cut-off were found in 43 
      cases (7.1%) with cumulative concentrations between 507 and 22,580 ng/g and with 
      one outlier of about 150,000 ng/g (EtG not detected). EtG was detected in 97
      cases (16.3%) and concentrations between LOD and 10,200 ng/g with another outlier
      of 82,000 ng/g (FAEE 10,500 ng/g). Optimal agreement between the two markers was 
      obtained with a cut-off for EtG of 274 ng/g and 547 cases with both FAEE- and
      EtG-negative, 33 cases with both FAEE- and EtG-positive, nine cases with
      FAEE-positive and EtG-negative, and seven cases with FAEE-negative and
      EtG-positive. Differences in physical, chemical, and biochemical properties and
      in the pharmacokinetic behavior are discussed as reasons for the deviating cases.
      In none of the 602 cases, serious alcohol consumption was reported by the mothers
      and no evidence for gestational ethanol exposure was observed in the medical
      investigation of the newborns. It is concluded that the combined use of FAEE and 
      EtG in meconium as markers for fetal alcohol exposure essentially increases the
      accuracy of the interpretation and helps to avoid false positive and
      false-negative results.

TI  - Maternal alcohol use before and during pregnancy among women in Taranaki, New
      Zealand.
PG  - 20-32
AB  - AIMS: The study researched alcohol consumption and drinking patterns before and
      during pregnancy. METHOD: This was a 1 month self report survey of postnatal
      women from 21 May-22 June 2006. A multiple choice questionnaire was handed out to
      them on the first or second postnatal day. RESULTS: There were a total of 117
      deliveries. The questionnaire was completed by 100 of the 104 women who received 
      it. Before pregnancy, 80% of women reported drinking alcohol; 66% binge drinking.
      Twenty-eight percent continued consuming alcohol throughout pregnancy. The
      majority did reduce or stop their alcohol consumption, 7% however did not. Ten
      percent were drinking more than 2 units per typical day and more than 7 units per
      week during pregnancy. Four percent was drinking a lot more than this. Nine
      percent of the total cohort reported binge drinking during pregnancy. CONCLUSION:
      Just over a quarter of women drink alcohol throughout pregnancy. A significant
      minority of women drink relatively heavily (more than 4 units per occasion and
      multiple times per week) during pregnancy. Many women do reduce their alcohol use
      because of the pregnancy, but often only after they become aware of it. In New
      Zealand there is a real risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

PG  - 681-92
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01137.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine biobehavioral responses to an acute pain event in a Cape
      Town, South Africa, cohort consisting of 28 Cape Colored (mixed ancestry)
      newborns (n = 14) heavily exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (exposed), and born
      to abstainers (n = 14) or light (< or = 0.5 oz absolute alcohol/d) drinkers
      (controls). METHODS: Mothers were recruited during the third trimester of
      pregnancy. Newborn data were collected on postpartum day 3 in the maternity
      obstetrical unit where the infant had been delivered. Heavy prenatal alcohol
      exposure was defined as maternal consumption of at least 14 drinks/wk or at least
      1 incident of binge drinking/mo. Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers
      [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral
      measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were
      collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and
      recovery). After a feeding and nap, newborns were administered an abbreviated
      Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. RESULTS: There were no
      between-group differences in maternal age, marital status, parity, gravidity,
      depression, anxiety, pregnancy smoking, maternal education, or infant gestational
      age at birth (all ps > 0.15). In both groups, HR increased with the heel lance
      and decreased during the postlance period. The alcohol-exposed group had lower
      mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time. Cortisol
      levels showed no change over time in controls but decreased over time in exposed 
      infants. Although facial action analyses revealed no group differences in
      response to the heel lance, behavioral responses assessed on the Brazelton
      Neonatal Scale showed less arousal in the exposed group. CONCLUSIONS: Both
      cardiac autonomic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress reactivity measures
      suggest a blunted response to an acute noxious event in alcohol-exposed newborns.
      This is supported by results on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale indicating reduced
      behavioral arousal in the exposed group. To our knowledge, these data provide the
      first biobehavioral examination of early pain reactivity in alcohol-exposed
      newborns and have important implications for understanding neuro-/biobehavioral
      effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the newborn period.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in Israel.
PG  - 619-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a range of disabilities caused by 
      gestational exposure to alcohol. FASD is the leading cause of preventable mental 
      retardation and developmental disability in the United States, with an incidence 
      of 1-10 per 1000 live births. FASD in Israel has yet to be examined
      systematically. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate professionals' experience, awareness and 
      knowledge of FASD in Israel and their awareness of maternal consumption of
      alcohol, and to collect epidemiological data on the syndrome in Israel. METHODS: 
      A short questionnaire was sent to all 43 program directors of genetic institutes 
      (n = 14) and child developmental centers in Israel (n = 29). Four questions
      related to their experience and knowledge of FASD. The epidemiological survey
      included data from all 17 hospitals in Israel and from the two main health
      management organizations within the public health care system. RESULTS: The
      response rate was 98% (n = 42). A total of 38.1% of respondents reported having
      diagnosed at least one case of FASD and fewer than 10% of respondents stated that
      the knowledge regarding FASD among physicians in Israel was adequate.
      Developmental pediatricians were more likely to have diagnosed at least one case 
      as compared to geneticists. During the period 1998-2007 the diagnosis of FASD
      appeared in the records of only 4 patients from the total number of 17 hospitals 
      in Israel. During the same period only six patients were diagnosed at the HMO
      within the public health care system. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the accumulated
      knowledge on FASD in many countries and the increase in alcohol consumption in
      Israel, professionals' awareness of its potential damage is limited. Educational 
      programs to increase physician awareness should accompany publicity campaigns
      warning the public of the dangers associated with alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters the patterns of facial asymmetry.
PG  - 649-57
LID - 10.1016/j.alcohol.2009.10.016 [doi]
AB  - Directional asymmetry, the systematic differences between the left and right body
      sides, is widespread in human populations. Changes in directional asymmetry are
      associated with various disorders that affect craniofacial development. Because
      facial dysmorphology is a key criterion for diagnosing fetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS), the question arises whether in utero alcohol exposure alters directional
      asymmetry in the face. Data on the relative position of 17 morphologic landmarks 
      were obtained from facial scans of children who were classified as either FAS or 
      control. Shape data obtained from the landmarks were analyzed with the methods of
      geometric morphometrics. Our analyses showed significant directional asymmetry of
      facial shape, consisting primarily of a shift of midline landmarks to the right
      and a displacement of the landmarks around the eyes to the left. The asymmetry of
      FAS and control groups differed significantly and average directional asymmetry
      was increased in those individuals exposed to alcohol in utero. These results
      suggest that the developmental consequences of fetal alcohol exposure affect a
      wide range of craniofacial features in addition to those generally recognized and
      used for diagnosis of FAS.

AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading preventable causes of
      developmental disabilities with serious permanent consequences. Regardless of the
      increased awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 13% of women in the United
      States drink alcohol during pregnancy. Health care professionals do not routinely
      assess the frequency and quantity of alcohol use by their patients. This study
      examined the knowledge, skills, and practices of family medicine residency and
      clerkship directors and assessed the time devoted and format of FAS curricula in 
      the programs. A self-administered anonymous survey was sent to the residency and 
      clerkship directors (N=571). Response rate of clerkship directors was 52% and
      residency directors 46%. Both groups showed high level of knowledge of FASD and
      of alcohol counseling practices for pregnant women. Although almost two thirds of
      the residency programs had FASD integrated in the curriculum, an equivalent
      fraction of predoctoral programs did not. More than half of the clerkship
      directors without FASD in their curriculum agreed that a need exists for its
      inclusion. These findings raise important medical education and policy issues and
      provide insight into the disparity in FASD content of curricula between
      predoctoral and family medicine residency programs in the United States. The role
      of physician counseling in primary prevention of FAS should continue to be
      stressed in predoctoral and residency education.

AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a common cause of developmental
      disability, birth defects, and mortality. The performance characteristics of
      current diagnostic tools for FASD are not adequately reported. This study
      examines the performance characteristics of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic
      Checklist (FASDC). In a population of 658 subjects from North Dakota, we used the
      FASDC score to examine the agreement between FASDC score, clinical diagnosis, and
      the Institute of Medicine criteria for FASD. All subjects were seen for
      evaluation in the genetic/dysmorphology clinics, which are funded by the state to
      provide genetic diagnostic services for residents of North Dakota. We compared
      the clinical diagnosis and the FASDC scores to determine the performance
      characteristics of the FASDC in the categorical diagnosis of fetal alcohol
      spectrum (FAS), other-FASD, and a group with No-FASD. Comparisons were made using
      univariate and logistic models of outcomes using both the presence and the
      absence of alcohol exposure or FASDC phenotype data. The FASDC performance
      characteristics for differentiation of the FAS group from non-FASD were excellent
      (accuracy 99%, sensitivity 99%, and specificity 99%). Logistic models for
      subjects with scores in the FASD range were differentiated with an accuracy of
      82%, sensitivity 85%, and specificity 80% using the data on phenotype and
      exposure. We were able to delineate subjects with scores in the No-FASD range
      with an accuracy of 78%, sensitivity 64%, and specificity 81% without including
      the exposure and phenotype data by use of the other descriptive data (maternal
      characteristics, birth records, and demographic data) from the FASDC. All
      diagnostic tools should have performance characteristics assessed and available
      before adoption for use in clinical settings. The FASDC scores produce diagnostic
      groupings that approximate expert clinical judgment. The tool may be useful in
      other clinical settings for the diagnosis of FASD or as an FASD registry or
      research database.

      predicts pregnancy and teen outcomes.

AB  - Detecting patterns of maternal drinking that place fetuses at risk for fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is critical to diagnosis, treatment, and
      prevention but is challenging because information on antenatal drinking collected
      during pregnancy is often insufficient or lacking. Although retrospective
      assessments have been considered less favored by many researchers due to presumed
      poor reliability, this perception may be inaccurate because of reduced maternal
      denial and/or distortion. The present study hypothesized that fetal alcohol
      exposure, as assessed retrospectively during child adolescence, would be related 
      significantly to prior measures of maternal drinking and would predict
      alcohol-related behavioral problems in teens better than antenatal measures of
      maternal alcohol consumption. Drinking was assessed during pregnancy, and
      retrospectively about the same pregnancy, at a 14-year follow-up in 288
      African-American women using well-validated semistructured interviews. Regression
      analysis examined the predictive validity of both drinking assessments on
      pregnancy outcomes and on teacher-reported teen behavior outcomes. Retrospective 
      maternal self-reported drinking assessed 14 years postpartum was significantly
      higher than antenatal reports of consumption. Retrospective report identified
      10.8 times more women as risk drinkers (>/= one drink per day) than the antenatal
      report. Antenatal and retrospective reports were moderately correlated and both
      were correlated with the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Self-reported
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy based on retrospective report identified
      significantly more teens exposed prenatally to at-risk alcohol levels than
      antenatal, in-pregnancy reports. Retrospective report predicted more teen
      behavior problems (e.g., attention problems and externalizing behaviors) than the
      antenatal report. Antenatal report predicted younger gestational age at birth and
      retrospective report predicted smaller birth size; neither predicted teen IQ.
      These results suggest that if only antenatal, in-pregnancy maternal report is
      used, then a substantial proportion of children exposed prenatally to risk levels
      of alcohol might be misclassified. The validity of retrospective assessment of
      prior drinking during pregnancy as a more effective indicator of prenatal
      exposure was established by predicting more behavioral problems in teens than
      antenatal report. Retrospective report can provide valid information about
      drinking during a prior pregnancy and may facilitate diagnosis and subsequent
      interventions by educators, social service personnel, and health-care providers, 
      thereby reducing the life-long impact of FASDs.

LID - 10.1016/j.alcohol.2009.08.007 [doi]
AB  - Many previous attempts by fetal alcohol spectrum disorders researchers to compare
      data across multiple prospective and retrospective human studies have failed
      because of both structural differences in the collected data and difficulty in
      coming to agreement on the precise meaning of the terminology used to describe
      the collected data. Although some groups of researchers have an established track
      record of successfully integrating data, attempts to integrate data more broadly 
      among different groups of researchers have generally faltered. Lack of tools to
      help researchers share and integrate data has also hampered data analysis. This
      situation has delayed improving diagnosis, intervention, and treatment before and
      after birth. We worked with various researchers and research programs in the
      Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CI-FASD) to develop
      a set of common data dictionaries to describe the data to be collected, including
      definitions of terms and specification of allowable values. The resulting data
      dictionaries were the basis for creating a central data repository (CI-FASD
      Central Repository) and software tools to input and query data. Data entry
      restrictions ensure that only data that conform to the data dictionaries reach
      the CI-FASD Central Repository. The result is an effective system for centralized
      and unified management of the data collected and analyzed by the initiative,
      including a secure, long-term data repository. CI-FASD researchers are able to
      integrate and analyze data of different types, using multiple methods, and
      collected from multiple populations, and data are retained for future reuse in a 
      secure, robust repository.

AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)is the leading cause of mental retardation worldwide 
      but is also the foremost preventable cause of neurobehavioral and developmental
      abnormalities. It is equally important to know spectrum of disorders due to
      maternal alcoholism during pregnancy such as Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
      (FASD)in order to identify and treat affected child and family effectively. This 
      article aims to create awareness among practising clinicians most of whom are
      only aware of phenotypical variant of FASD which is FAS.In this article we
      discuss those aspects of FASD relevant to the clinician such as: terminological
      ambiguity, assessment, diagnosis and prevention.

TI  - Can prenatal screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder be justified? A
      commentary.
PG  - 128-30

AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading cause of non-genetic mental
      retardation in the USA, possibly exceeding even Down syndrome, which is currently
      approaching 1 in 500 live births. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in
      brain, craniofacial and heart defects, neurotoxicity, and immune dysfunction. The
      preferred action taken to prevent alcohol consumption during pregnancy is
      abstinence. However, the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD remain a
      major public health need in this country and throughout the world. The
      biochemical molecules involved in the developmental abnormalities encompass a
      vast array of signal transduction and synaptic pathways which involve
      neurotransmitters and neurotrophic peptides. Recent advances in medicine-based
      therapies for FASD have been reported, and include the use of small molecule
      agonists, antagonists, and competitive inhibitors. Since biomarkers for FASD have
      previously been identified in clinical research reports, multicenter screening
      feasibility studies now seem warranted and could be initiated following adequate 
      funding, protocols, procedures, and institutional review board approvals.

      rural area of South Africa.
PG  - 534-42
LID - 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.10.040 [doi]
AB  - The study sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of being at risk of
      an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) among women of child-bearing age in an urban
      and rural location in South Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional household
      survey of 1018 women aged 18-44 years in one urban (n=606) and one rural (n=412) 
      site. The women were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. We defined the
      primary dependent variable, being at risk of having an AEP, as current alcohol
      use, not being pregnant, being fertile, and no effective use of contraceptives.
      The independent variables included demographic, substance use, health
      perceptions, psycho-social, and partner characteristics. The rural women (21.84%)
      were more likely than their urban counterparts (11.22%) to be at risk of an AEP. 
      In multiple logistic regression analyses, significant predictors of being in the 
      "at risk" group for the urban women were (a) being 'white' as opposed to
      'black/African', and being 'coloured' as opposed to 'black/African'; and (b)
      current smoking. For the rural women, significant risk factors were (a) current
      smoking and (b) early onset of alcohol use. The significant protective factors
      were (a) education; (b) knowledge about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; (c) parity. Use
      of stricter alcohol use criteria (i.e., three or more drinks and five or more
      drinks per sitting) in the definition of risk of an AEP yielded slightly
      different patterns of significant predictors. The results revealed high levels of
      risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, especially amongst the rural women, and a
      need for location-specific prevention programmes. The high burden of AEP in South
      Africa calls for the establishment of national AEP prevention strategies and
      programmes as a matter of urgency.

TI  - Impact of a social skills intervention on the hostile attributions of children
      with prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 231-41
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01086.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been linked to a wide array of
      developmental deficits, including significant impairments in social skills. Given
      the extensive body of evidence linking social information-processing patterns
      with social behavior, it is possible that social information-processing may
      represent one mechanism of behavioral change. The present investigation sought to
      answer the question of whether a well-established social skills intervention
      decreased the hostile attributions of children with PAE. Further, was there a
      differential impact of the intervention on hostile attributions in the context of
      peer provocation versus group entry scenarios? METHODS: Participants consisted of
      100 children (51% male) with PAE between the ages of 6 and 12 years. Participants
      were randomly assigned to either a social skills intervention, Children's
      Friendship Training (CFT), or to a Delayed Treatment Control (DTC) condition.
      RESULTS: Analyses indicated that the social skills intervention resulted in a
      significantly lower proportion of hostile attributions in peer group entry, but
      not peer provocation, scenarios. This decrease was maintained over a 3-month
      follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in social information-processing among
      individuals with PAE can be improved through social skills intervention, and
      these changes may lead to more positive developmental outcomes.

TI  - Brain microstructure is related to math ability in children with fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder.
PG  - 354-63
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01097.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) often
      demonstrate a variety of cognitive deficits, but mathematical ability seems to be
      particularly affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Parietal brain regions have
      been implicated in both functional and structural studies of mathematical ability
      in healthy individuals, but little is known about the brain structure underlying 
      mathematical deficits in children with FASD. The goal of this study was to use
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the relationship between
      mathematical skill and brain white matter structure in children with FASD.
      METHODS: Twenty-one children aged 5 to 13 years diagnosed with FASD underwent DTI
      on a 1.5-T MRI scanner and cognitive assessments including the Woodcock-Johnson
      Quantitative Concepts test. Voxel-based analysis was conducted by normalizing
      subject images to a template and correlating fractional anisotropy (FA) values
      across the brain white matter with age-standardized math scores. RESULTS:
      Voxel-based analysis revealed 4 clusters with significant correlations between FA
      and math scores: 2 positively-correlated clusters in the left parietal region, 1 
      positively-correlated cluster in the left cerebellum, and 1 negatively-correlated
      cluster in the bilateral brainstem. Diffusion tractography identified the
      specific white matter tracts passing through these clusters, namely the left
      superior longitudinal fasciculus, left corticospinal tract and body of the corpus
      callosum, middle cerebellar peduncle, and bilateral projection fibers including
      the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results identify 4 key regions related to mathematical ability and provide a link
      between brain microstructure and cognitive skills in children with FASD. Given
      previous findings in typically developing children and those with other abnormal 
      conditions, our results highlight the consistent importance of the left parietal 
      area for mathematical tasks across various populations, and also demonstrate
      other regions that may be specific to mathematical processing in children with
      FASD.

TI  - A new method of prenatal alcohol classification accounting for dose, pattern and 
      timing of exposure: improving our ability to examine fetal effects from low to
      moderate alcohol.
PG  - 956-62
LID - 10.1136/jech.2009.091785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: When examining the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and 
      fetal effects, the timing and intensity of exposure have been ignored in
      epidemiological studies. The effect of using dose, pattern and timing of
      consumption ("composite" method) was investigated in this study, to examine the
      association between prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal effects. METHODS: The
      composite method resulted in six categories of exposure (abstinent, low,
      moderate, binge <weekly, binge 1-2x/week and heavy). The odds of language delay
      and child behaviour problems were calculated for the composite method and then
      compared with an analysis using averaged estimates of <1 and 1+ drinks per day
      and with stratification by quantity ignoring dose per occasion. Data used for the
      analyses were from a 10% random sample of non-Indigenous women delivering a live 
      infant in Western Australia (1995-1997). Participants from the 1995-1996 cohort
      were invited to participate in an 8 year longitudinal survey (78% response rate
      n=2224; 85% were followed-up at 2 years, 73% at 5 years and 61% at 8 years).
      RESULTS: The effect of moderate and binge levels of exposure was only evident
      with the composite method; anxiety/depression following first-trimester moderate 
      exposure (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.34), and following late pregnancy moderate
      (aggressive behaviour OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.09) and binge (language delay OR 
      3.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 9.93) exposures. Results for heavy levels of exposure were
      similar with each method. The estimates for late pregnancy were imprecise due to 
      small numbers. Conclusion The composite method of classification more closely
      reflects real-life drinking patterns and better discriminates maternal drinking
      than the other methods, particularly low, moderate and binge levels.

TI  - Periconceptional binge drinking and acculturation among pregnant Latinas in New
      Mexico.
PG  - 475-81
LID - 10.1016/j.alcohol.2009.08.002 [doi]
AB  - Binge drinking during pregnancy might lead to the development of Fetal Alcohol
      Spectrum Disorders in the offspring. Latinas are often considered a low-risk
      group for alcohol abuse, although recent reports indicate that the prevalence of 
      alcohol consumption in this group is increasing due to changing cultural norms.
      The predictors of alcohol consumption during pregnancy among Latinas are largely 
      unknown. We explored predictors of periconceptional drinking among Latinas
      (n=155) recruited into an ongoing cohort study at the University of New Mexico.
      Women were interviewed by a bilingual trained interviewer about any episodes of
      binge drinking (>or=4 drinks/occasion) a month around their last menstrual period
      (LMP) and were administered a TWEAK questionnaire. Sociodemographic, lifestyle,
      and reproductive health characteristics were also ascertained. Predictors of
      binge drinking were identified by Chi-square test and logistic regression in
      univariate and multivariable analyses, respectively. Backward selection procedure
      was used to identify covariates that were independently associated with binge
      drinking in the final model. The mean age of participants was 27.0+/-5.8 years
      and 69% were foreign born. In the entire sample, 17.4% of pregnant Latinas
      admitted at least one binge-drinking episode in the month around their LMP.
      Results of multivariate analysis indicate that Latinas born in the United States 
      have a much greater risk of binge drinking in the periconceptional period (odds
      ratio [OR]=3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 8.9) compared with
      foreign-born Latinas. Similarly, Latinas who primarily speak English at home were
      at much greater risk (OR=3.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 10.5) compared with primarily
      Spanish-speaking women. No other variables were identified as significant
      predictors in multivariable models. Our results indicate that more acculturated
      Latinas are at much greater risk of binge drinking before conception and in early
      pregnancy compared with less acculturated Latinas. Culturally sensitive
      interventions should be developed to address risky alcohol consumption among
      Latinas of reproductive age.

TI  - Alcohol drinking pattern during pregnancy and risk of infant mortality.
PG  - 884-91
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181bbd46c [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The safety of small amounts of alcohol drinking and occasional
      binge-level drinking during pregnancy remains unsettled. We examined the
      association of maternal average alcohol intake and binge drinking (>or=5 drinks
      per sitting) with infant mortality, both in the neonatal and postneonatal period.
      METHODS: Participants were 79,216 mothers who were enrolled in the Danish
      National Birth Cohort in 1996-2002, gave birth to a live-born singleton, and
      provided information while they were pregnant on alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy. Information on infant mortality and causes of death was obtained from 
      national registries and medical records. RESULTS: During the first year of life, 
      279 children (0.35%) died, 204 during the neonatal period. Infant mortality was
      not associated with alcohol drinking, even at a consumption level of either 4+
      drinks per week or 3+ occasions of binge drinking. Postneonatal mortality was
      associated with an intake of 4+ drinks per week (hazard ratio = 3.56 [95%
      confidence interval = 1.15-8.43]) and with 3+ binge episodes (2.69 [1.27-5.69]). 
      When restricting analyses to term births, both infant mortality and postneonatal 
      mortality were associated with a weekly average intake of 4+ drinks or 3+ binge
      episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Among term infants, intake of at least 4 drinks of alcohol
      per week or binging on 3 or more occasions during pregnancy are associated with
      an increased risk of infant mortality, especially during the postneonatal period.

TI  - Preconception counseling in the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome: a unique
      window of opportunity.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - The role of alcohol in the causation of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) has been
      firmly established. In most cases events leading to its occurrence have been set 
      into motion prior to conception. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the sole
      causative agent of FAS, can therefore be prevented even prior to conception by
      implementation of preconception counseling (PCC). The present review examines the
      important issues involved in the implementation of PCC for the prevention of FAS 
      which can be of immense help to the affected population.

TI  - Women, alcohol and the environment: an update and perspectives in neuroscience.
PG  - 77-81
AB  - This paper highlights gender peculiarities in the neuroscience of alcohol effects
      and draws attention to emerging problems due to simultaneous exposure to alcohol 
      and environmental factors. All the available gender studies on alcohol show
      greater severity of alcohol-related damage, including brain damage, in females
      compared with males. The differences are due to physiological peculiarities that 
      make women more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol. Today the trend to start
      consuming alcohol at a younger age, together with the growing number of women
      drinking excessively, is increasing the alcohol-related risks to women's health
      and justifying the need for better, gender-based studies of alcohol use and
      abuse. A further aspect to consider in this context is the risk of the occurrence
      of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders and foetal alcohol syndrome in the offspring
      of women who drink during pregnancy. Several lines of evidence indicate that
      prenatal ethanol exposure can influence cell proliferation and differentiation in
      the central nervous system, causing severe neurotoxicity and permanent birth
      defects.

TI  - Atypical functional lateralization in children with fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 696-705
LID - 10.1002/dev.20404 [doi]
AB  - In order to explore effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on functional
      lateralization, item tasks measuring preferences of hand, foot, eye, and ear were
      administered to a sample of 23 children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS) compared with typically developing (TD) children. In addition, a dichotic
      listening task was administered to a subsample of 11 children with FAS and a TD
      group of comparable age, sex and handedness. The children with FAS were
      characterized by increased nonright-handedness compared with TD children. No
      differences were evident for preferential use of foot, eye, or ear. Moreover,
      children with FAS displayed more right ear extinctions during dichotic listening 
      relative to TD children, indicating a lack of right ear advantage. The results
      add to findings of decreased manual asymmetry and less left-lateralized speech
      perception in children with developmental disorders, and are further discussed in
      relation to the high incidence of callosal abnormalities in alcohol-exposed
      children.

AB  - Alcohol use among women of childbearing age is a leading, preventable cause of
      birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. Although most 
      women reduce their alcohol use upon pregnancy recognition, some women report
      drinking during pregnancy and others may continue to drink prior to realizing
      they are pregnant. These findings emphasize the need for effective prevention
      strategies for both pregnant and nonpregnant women who might be at risk for an
      alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). This report reviews evidence supporting alcohol 
      screening and brief intervention as an effective approach to reducing problem
      drinking and AEPs that can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. In addition,
      this article highlights a recent report of the National Task Force on Fetal
      Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect that describes effective interventions 
      to reduce alcohol use and AEPs, and outlines recommendations on promoting and
      improving these strategies. Utilizing evidence-based alcohol screening tools and 
      brief counseling for women at risk for an AEP and other effective
      population-based strategies can help achieve future alcohol-free pregnancies.

AB  - The detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain
      include structural brain anomalies as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits. 
      Initial neuroimaging studies of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) using
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed previous autopsy reports of overall
      reduction in brain volume and central nervous system (CNS) disorganization, with 
      specific structural abnormalities of the corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate,
      and hippocampus. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed detection of
      regional increases in cortical thickness and gray matter volume along with
      decreased volume and disorganization of white matter in individuals with FASD. In
      addition, functional imaging studies have found functional and neurochemical
      differences in those prenatally exposed to alcohol. Behavioral alterations noted 
      in individuals with FASD are consistent with the findings noted in the brain
      imaging studies. Continued neuroimaging studies are needed to further advance
      understanding of the neuroteratogenic effects of alcohol.

PG  - 170-5
LID - 10.1002/ddrr.71 [doi]
AB  - Historically, alcohol has been used for different purposes including as a part of
      religious observances, as a food, at times as a medicine and its well-known use
      as a beverage. Until relatively recently these purposes have not changed and have
      at times been at odds with one another, resulting in collisions among policies
      and practices in science, medicine, public policy and the law. One area in which 
      this has been particularly true is that of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
      (FASD) where the adverse consequences of consumed alcohol on children in the womb
      and after birth may have been observed since antiquity, but the actions taken
      based on such observations have been influenced as much by the
      socio/cultural/political context of the times in which they were made as by
      evidence of harm. This article provides an overview of the inherent confusion
      when new scientific findings confront prevailing medical practice, the history
      involved in this confusion with respect to FASD, including public policy and
      legal issues that have arisen around alcohol and pregnancy, and the research and 
      clinical challenges still being faced.

AB  - Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) over 35 years ago,
      mounting evidence about the impact of maternal alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy has prompted increased attention to the link between prenatal alcohol
      exposure (PAE) and a constellation of developmental disabilities that are
      characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. These
      disabilities include a continuum of developmental disorders known as fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Longitudinal studies suggest that individuals
      with FASDs are at a greatly increased risk for adverse long-term outcomes,
      including mental health problems and poor social adjustment. This review
      summarizes the existing literature on mental health outcomes for individuals with
      PAE across the lifespan, including findings in infancy and early childhood,
      middle childhood, and adolescence and early adulthood. Research on the
      psychiatric disabilities suffered by individuals with FASDs throughout
      development highlights the need for training of mental health professionals in
      the identification and the provision of specific treatments to address the unique
      features of this developmental disability since early identification and
      treatment have been demonstrated to be protective against more serious secondary 
      disabilities. It is hoped that with greater awareness of the mental health
      problems experienced by individuals with FASDs, these individuals can receive
      appropriate and early treatment resulting in more adaptive and rewarding lives.

AB  - Exposure to alcohol in utero is considered to be the leading cause of
      developmental disabilities of known etiology. The most severe consequence of such
      exposure, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), is characterized by a distinct
      constellation of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation, and central
      nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Some individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure
      (PAE) do not meet the full criteria for FAS, but instead are diagnosed with
      partial FAS, alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), or alcohol
      related birth defects (ARBD). The entire continuum of effects from PAE is
      increasingly being referred to under the umbrella term of fetal alcohol spectrum 
      disorders (FASDs). An extensive body of research has documented major cognitive, 
      behavioral, adaptive, social, and emotional impairments among individuals with
      FASDs. Although FAS was identified in the U.S. over 35 years ago, the
      development, evaluation, and dissemination of evidence-based interventions for
      individuals with FASDs have lagged behind significantly. Encouragingly, however, 
      in recent years there has been a marked increase in efforts to design and test
      interventions to remediate the impairments associated with prenatal alcohol
      exposure. This article will review treatment needs and considerations for
      individuals with FASDs and their families, current empirically tested treatment
      approaches, case management issues, and suggestions for future directions in
      research on the treatment of FASDs.

AB  - The life-long neurological impairments found in people with fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASDs), including learning disabilities, impulsivity,
      hyperactivity, social ineptness, and poor judgment, can increase susceptibility
      to victimization and involvement in the criminal justice system (CJS).
      Individuals with FASDs become involved in the CJS as complainants, witnesses, and
      accused. Their disabilities, resulting from the prenatal alcohol exposure, must
      be considered at all stages in the legal process. Adverse experiences, such as
      having a dysfunctional family background, mental health problems, and substance
      use disorders, are compounding factors. Experiencing physical, sexual, and
      emotional abuse also increases the risk that these individuals will become
      involved in the CJS. It is critical that everyone involved in the CJS receives
      education and training to understand FASD and the implications for the individual
      offender. A comprehensive medical-legal report, prepared by professionals
      experienced with FASD, can help judges and lawyers understand the complex
      interactions among brain damage, genetics and the environment. Corrections
      workers and probation officers need to comprehend the significance of FASD and
      how it affects the offender's abilities to understand and follow rules and
      probation orders. Caregivers and parents need to be involved whenever possible.
      Early recognition of the disabilities associated with FASDs may help reduce the
      over-representation of this group in the CJS.

TI  - Prenatal origins of poor sleep in children.
PG  - 1086-92
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal
      tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poor sleep and more sleep disturbances in
      children. DESIGN: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children
      born at term. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep duration and efficiency were
      measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used
      both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and
      low sleep efficiency ( < or = 10th percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep
      Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth
      were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight
      and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7),
      respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of
      parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0).
      Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to
      7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and
      low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, 
      gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8
      years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Poor
      sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Possible mechanisms include alcohol 
      consumption during pregnancy and other conditions associated with small body size
      at birth.

TI  - Do Canadian prenatal record forms integrate evidence-based guidelines for the
      diagnosis of a FASD?
PG  - 274-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a significant public health issue with
      lifelong psychological, emotional and financial costs associated with caring for 
      an affected individual. In 2005, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health
      Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch developed evidence-based
      guidelines for the diagnosis of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We
      examined the extent to which prenatal records across Canadian provinces and
      territories currently integrate key recommendations from these guidelines.
      METHODS: A content analysis of prenatal record forms retrieved from each Canadian
      province and territory (N = 12) was conducted to identify all questions or
      intervention prompts related to prenatal screening, exposure assessment,
      counseling or referral for maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Findings were
      reviewed in relation to recommendations extrapolated from the Canadian guidelines
      and the FASD literature. RESULTS: All the prenatal record forms contained
      questions to assess maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. However, the
      dimensions of alcohol consumption assessed and the format, wording and number of 
      items related to each dimension varied markedly across provinces/territories.
      Only five prenatal record forms included a validated screening tool to identify
      risky alcohol drinking behaviour. Most of the forms lacked prompts to encourage
      providers to intervene or refer pregnant clients with high-risk drinking
      behaviour. CONCLUSION: Integration of the Canadian recommendations into Canadian 
      prenatal record forms may be an effective public health strategy for helping
      identify pregnancies at high risk for alcohol exposure, reducing the incidence of
      a FASD through appropriate prenatal intervention and referral, and facilitating
      early diagnosis of a FASD.

TI  - Comparison of adaptive behavior in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure 
      or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 2015-23
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01040.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adaptive behavior, the ability to respond successfully to everyday
      demands, may be especially sensitive to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol
      exposure. Similar adaptive dysfunction is common in other developmental disorders
      including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is frequently
      present in alcohol-exposed children and this overlap in clinical presentation
      makes identification of alcohol-exposed children difficult. Direct comparison of 
      children with prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD may yield distinct patterns of
      cognitive and behavioral performance and add to growing knowledge of the
      neuropsychological and behavioral profile of prenatal alcohol exposure.
      Therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare adaptive behavior in
      children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC), nonexposed
      children with ADHD (ADHD), and typically developing controls (CON). METHODS:
      Sixty-five children (ALC = 22, ADHD = 23, CON = 20) were selected from a larger
      ongoing study of the behavioral teratogenicity of alcohol. Alcohol-exposed and
      control participants were selected to match the ADHD subjects on age, sex,
      socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. Caregivers were administered the
      Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, a semi-structured interview, and were asked to
      rate their child's behavior on 3 domains of adaptive function. Data were analyzed
      using regression techniques. RESULTS: Relative to controls, children in both the 
      ALC and ADHD groups showed adaptive behavior deficits on all 3 domains and
      children in the ALC group were significantly more impaired than the ADHD group on
      the daily living skills domain. Within the ALC group, socialization standard
      scores were lower at older ages. This negative relationship between age and
      standard scores in the ALC group was also observed on the communication domain, a
      finding not previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that both
      children with prenatal alcohol exposure and children with ADHD show impairments
      in adaptive function relative to controls, but that the pattern of impairment
      differs between these clinical groups. Adaptive ability in children with prenatal
      alcohol exposure is characterized by an arrest in development, as evidenced by a 
      lack of improvement with age in socialization and communication scores. In
      contrast, children with ADHD exhibit a developmental delay in adaptive ability as
      their scores continued to improve with age, albeit not to the level of control
      children. Continued research focused on elucidating the patterns of deficits that
      exist in alcohol-exposed children ultimately will lead to improved differential
      diagnosis and effective interventions.

AB  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a major cause of mental retardation in
      Western countries. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is mainly characterized by pre-
      and postnatal stunted growth, neurocognitive disorders, and facial dysmorphism.
      It compromises the intellectual and behavioral prognosis of the child. Prevention
      tools exist, through better information of health professionals, for optimal care
      of high-risk women before, during, and after pregnancy, which would decrease the 
      incidence of SAF in the future.

TI  - Microstructural corpus callosum anomalies in children with prenatal alcohol
      exposure: an extension of previous diffusion tensor imaging findings.
PG  - 1825-35
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01021.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have now shown corpus callosum abnormalities using
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders 
      (FASD) in comparison with nonexposed controls. The data suggest that posterior
      regions of the callosum may be disproportionately affected. The current study
      builds on previous efforts, including our own work, and moves beyond midline
      corpus callosum to probe major inter-hemispheric white matter pathways with an
      improved DTI tractographic method. This study also expands on our prior work by
      evaluating a larger sample and by incorporating children with a broader range of 
      clinical effects including full-criteria fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). METHODS:
      Participants included 33 children with FASD (8 FAS, 23 partial FAS, 2 static
      encephalopathy) and 19 nonexposed controls between the ages of 10 and 17 years.
      Participants underwent DTI scans and intelligence testing. Groups (FASD vs.
      controls) were compared on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)
      in 6 white matter tracts projected through the corpus callosum. Exploratory
      analyses were also conducted examining the relationships between DTI measures in 
      the corpus callosum and measures of intellectual functioning and facial
      dysmorphology. RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, the FASD group had 
      significantly lower FA in 3 posterior tracts of the corpus callosum: the
      posterior mid-body, the isthmus, and the splenium. A trend-level finding also
      suggested lower FA in the genu. Measures of white matter integrity and cognition 
      were correlated and suggest some regional specificity, in that only posterior
      regions of the corpus callosum were associated with visual-perceptual skills.
      Correlations between measures of facial dysmorphology and posterior regions of
      the corpus callosum were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous
      DTI studies, these results suggest that microstructural posterior corpus callosum
      abnormalities are present in children with prenatal alcohol exposure and
      cognitive impairment. These abnormalities are clinically relevant because they
      are associated with cognitive deficits and appear to provide evidence of
      abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure independent of dysmorphic
      features. As such, they may yield important diagnostic and prognostic information
      not provided by the traditional facial characteristics.

AB  - AIMS: This study explores associations between early weaning and alcohol use
      disorders in youth and mechanisms by which these associations may operate.
      DESIGN: We used data from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy and its
      outcomes, an Australian birth cohort study based in Brisbane. SETTING AND
      PARTICIPANTS: This study is based on a subsample of 2370 participants for whom
      complete data were available at age 21 years. Length and method of breastfeeding 
      were assessed at 6 months. MEASUREMENTS: Alcohol use disorders were assessed at
      age 21 using the life-time version of the Composite International Diagnostic
      Interview-computerized version (CIDI-Auto). We adjusted for maternal age, marital
      status, education, alcohol, tobacco use, anxiety, depression and maternal
      attitudes towards the baby. Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD) 
      and Intellect Quotient (IQ) were measured with the Child Behaviour Checklist (5
      years) and the Ravens SM (14 years), respectively. FINDINGS: Those who had been
      weaned within 2 weeks of being born and breastfed at regular intervals were at
      increased risk of meeting criteria for alcohol use disorders at age 21 [odds
      ratio (OR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.07, 2.72]. CONCLUSION: This study
      confirms a small but robust association between early weaning and increased risk 
      of alcohol use disorders.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present review describes the different variants of Fetal
      Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) as a consequence of maternal alcohol abuse
      during pregnancy. According to international findings, some 3000 to 4000 affected
      newborns may be expected annually in Germany. Detection of these individuals in
      clinical practice is insufficient. METHOD: Selective review of the literature and
      report of own findings based on longitudinal studies. RESULTS: Key features of
      FASD are short stature, microcephaly, various dysmorphic features, in severe
      cases amongst others consisting of congenital heart disease and dysplasias of the
      skeleton and urogenital system, varying degrees of developmental delay including 
      mental retardation, and a positive history of maternal alcohol abuse during
      pregnancy. Longitudinal studies in young adulthood show that independent of the
      severity of FASD the key features remain associated with limitations of an
      independent life-style. DISCUSSION: Pathogenesis of FASD is not sufficiently
      clear and there is no causal treatment. Thus, besides prevention and information,
      early diagnosis, installation of fostering or adoption, and intensive
      psychosocial care including selection of appropriate schooling, occupational
      counselling and supportive care in adulthood are mandatory.

TI  - Toward prevention of alcohol exposed pregnancies: characteristics that relate to 
      ineffective contraception and risky drinking.
PG  - 443-52

AB  - Alcohol-exposed pregnancy is a leading cause of preventable birth defects in the 
      United States. This paper describes the motivational patterns that relate to
      risky drinking and ineffective contraception, two behaviors that can result in
      alcohol-exposed pregnancy. As part of an intervention study aimed at reducing
      alcohol-exposed pregnancy 124 women were recruited and reported demographic
      characteristics, readiness to change, stages of change, drinking, contraception, 
      and sexual behavior history. Our results showed the following. Drinking: A
      significant positive correlation was found between the number of drinks consumed 
      in 90 days and the Importance to reduce drinking (r = .23, p = .008). A
      significant negative correlation between number of drinks and confidence to
      reduce drinking (r = -.39, p = .000) was found as well. Significant differences
      were found in the total number of drinks consumed in 90 days between the five
      stages of change (F = (4,118), 3.12, p = .01). Women in Preparation reported
      drinking a significantly higher number of drinks than women in other stages of
      change. Contraception: There were significant negative correlations between
      ineffective contraception and Importance (r = -.38, p = .00), confidence (r =
      -.20, p = .02) and Readiness (r = -.43, p = .00) to use contraception
      effectively. Significant differences in contraception ineffectiveness were found 
      for women in different stages of change (F = (4,115) 8.58, p = .000). Women in
      Precontemplation reported significantly higher levels of contraception
      ineffectiveness compared to women in other stages of change. Results show a clear
      relationship between higher alcohol consumption and higher levels of motivation
      to reduce drinking. In contrast, higher levels of ineffective contraception were 
      related to lower levels of motivation to use contraception effectively. This
      suggests risky drinking may be better targeted with brief skills building
      interventions and ineffective contraception may require interventions that
      enhance problem awareness and motivation.

AB  - The publication of the latest contribution to the alcohol-in-pregnancy debate,
      and the now customary flurry of media attention it generated, have precipitated
      the renewal of a series of ongoing debates about safe levels of consumption and
      responsible prenatal conduct. The University College London (UCL) study's finding
      that low levels of alcohol did not contribute to adverse behavioural outcomes-and
      may indeed have made a positive contribution in some cases-is unlikely to be the 
      last word on the subject. Proving a negative correlation is notoriously difficult
      (technically, impossible), and other studies have offered alternative claims. The
      author is not an epidemiologist, and the purpose of this article is not to
      evaluate the competing empirical claims. However, the question of what
      information and advice healthcare practitioners ought to present to pregnant
      women, or prospectively or potentially pregnant women, in a situation of
      uncertainty is one to which healthcare ethicists may have a contribution to make.
      In this article, it is argued that the total abstinence policy advocated by the
      UK's Department of Health, and even more stridently by the British Medical
      Association, sits uneasily with recent data and is far from ethically
      unproblematic. In particular, the "precautionary" approach advocated by these
      bodies displays both scant regard for the autonomy of pregnant and prospectively 
      pregnant women and a confused grasp of the principles of beneficence and
      non-maleficence.

TI  - Psychological and/or educational interventions for reducing alcohol consumption
      in pregnant women and women planning pregnancy.
PG  - CD004228
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004228.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is estimated that more than 20% of pregnant women worldwide
      consume alcohol. Current research suggests that alcohol intake of seven or more
      standard drinks (one standard drink = 13.6 grams of absolute alcohol) per week
      during pregnancy places the baby at risk of serious, lifelong developmental and
      cognitive disabilities. Psychological and educational interventions may help
      women to reduce their alcohol intake during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To determine
      the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions to reduce
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy in pregnant women or women planning
      pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth
      Group's Trials Register (August 2008), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 
      4), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1980 to November 2007), CINAHL (1982
      to November 2007), Counsel.Lit (1980 to November 2007), PsycLIT (1974 to November
      2007) and PsycINFO (1967 to November 2007) and checked cited references from
      retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials examining
      the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions for reducing
      consumption of alcohol among pregnant women, or women planning for pregnancy.
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently extracted
      information from the results sections of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Four
      studies met the inclusion criteria (715 pregnant women), and reported on at least
      one of the outcomes of interest. We performed no meta-analyses as the
      interventions and outcomes measured in the studies were not sufficiently similar.
      For most outcomes there were no significant differences between groups; and
      results relating to abstaining or reducing alcohol consumption were mixed.
      Results from individual studies suggest that interventions may encourage women to
      abstain from alcohol in pregnancy. There was very little information provided on 
      the effects of interventions on the health of mothers and babies. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from the limited number of studies suggests that
      psychological and educational interventions may result in increased abstinence
      from alcohol, and a reduction in alcohol consumption among pregnant women.
      However, results were not consistent, and the paucity of studies, the number of
      total participants, the high risk of bias of some of the studies, and the
      complexity of interventions limits our ability to determine the type of
      intervention which would be most effective in increasing abstinence from, or
      reducing the consumption of, alcohol among pregnant women.

TI  - Auxological evaluation and determinants of growth failure at the time of adoption
      in Eastern European adoptees.
PG  - 31-9
AB  - AIM: To identify factors contributing to growth failure in international adoptees
      (IAs) from Eastern Europe. STUDY DESIGN: 138 IAs from Eastern Europe, 6-59 months
      old, were evaluated within 3 weeks of US arrival. Complete history,
      anthropometry, and serum for growth factors were obtained. Facial features were
      examined for risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. RESULTS: Upon arrival, mean
      height (-1.23 +/- 1.07), weight (-1.43 +/- 1.29), and occipitofrontal
      circumference (OFC) (-0.63 +/- 1.10) SDS in IAs were significantly less than
      population means for US children. In a multiple regression model, age, low birth 
      weight (LBW), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, and high risk for
      fetal alcohol syndrome were independent predictors of height SDS. LBW also
      independently predicted lower weight SDS and smaller OFC SDS. CONCLUSIONS: We
      recommend that IAs undergo screening upon US arrival to identify risk factors for
      poor growth, particularly evidence of LBW and fetal alcohol exposure. Catch-up
      growth should be monitored in all children following adoption.

AB  - Magnetic resonance (MR) technology offers noninvasive methods for in vivo
      assessment of neuroabnormalities. A comprehensive neuropsychological/behavioral, 
      MR imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS) and functional MRI (fMRI) assessment was 
      administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to
      determine whether global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified and to
      distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the spectrum. The four study
      groups included (1) FAS/partial FAS; (2) static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed
      (SE/AE); (3) neurobehavioral disorder/alcohol exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed with
      the FASD 4-Digit Code; and (4) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure.
      Results are presented in four separate reports: MRS (reported here) and
      neuropsychological/behavioral, MRI and fMRI outcomes (reported separately). MRS
      was used to compare neurometabolite concentrations [choline (Cho),
      n-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and creatine (Cre)] in a white matter region and a
      hippocampal region between the four study groups. Choline concentration in the
      frontal/parietal white matter region, lateral to the midsection of the corpus
      callosum, was significantly lower in FAS/PFAS relative to all other study groups.
      Choline decreased significantly with decreasing frontal white matter volume and
      corpus callosum length. These outcomes suggest low choline concentrations may
      reflect white matter deficits among FAS/PFAS. Choline also decreased
      significantly with increasing severity of the 4-Digit FAS facial phenotype,
      increasing impairment in psychological performance and increasing alcohol
      exposure. NAA and Cre concentrations did not vary significantly. This study
      provides further evidence of the vulnerability of the cholinergic system in FASD.

TI  - Neuropyschological and behavioral outcomes from a comprehensive magnetic
      resonance study of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - e178-201
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and research advancements in the field of fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD) require accurate and valid identification of FASD
      clinical subgroups. OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive neuropsychological battery,
      coupled with magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and
      functional MRI (fMRI) were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be
      identified across the spectrum, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications
      within the spectrum. The neuropsychological outcomes of the comprehensive
      neuroimaging study are presented here. METHODS: The study groups included: 1)
      FAS/Partial FAS; 2) Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed (SE/AE); 3)
      Neurobehavioral Disorder/Alcohol Exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed by an
      interdisciplinary team using the FASD 4-Digit Code; and 4) healthy peers with no 
      prenatal alcohol. A standardized neuropsychological battery was administered to
      each child and their primary caregiver by a psychologist. RESULTS: Use of the
      4-Digit Code produced three clinically and statistically distinct FASD clinical
      subgroups. The three subgroups (ND/AE, SE/AE and FAS/PFAS) reflected a linear
      continuum of increasing neuropsychological impairment and physical abnormality,
      representing the full continuum of FASD. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders
      were comparably prevalent across the three FASD groups, and significantly more
      prevalent than among the Controls. All three FASD subgroups had comparably high
      levels of prenatal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although ND/AE, SE/AE, and
      FAS/PFAS are distinct FASD subgroups, these groups are not distinguishable solely
      by their neuropsychological profiles. While all children within a group shared
      the same magnitude of neuropsychological impairment, the patterns of impairment
      showed considerable individual variability. MRI, MRS and fMRI further
      distinguished these FASD subgroups.

LID - 10.1007/s10802-009-9313-5 [doi]
AB  - Based on caregiver report, children with prenatal alcohol exposure have
      difficulty with social functioning, but little is known about their social
      cognition. The current study assessed the social information processing patterns 
      of school-age children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure using a paradigm
      based on Crick and Dodge's reformulated six-stage model. Fifty-two children (aged
      7-11) with and without heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were tested using a
      structured interview measure of social information processing involving 18
      videotaped vignettes of children in group entry and provocation situations.
      Alcohol-exposed children displayed maladaptive processing patterns on the goal,
      response generation, and response evaluation steps in group entry situations, and
      encoding, attribution, response evaluation, and enactment steps during
      provocation situations. Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure also had
      difficulty on the Test of Problem Solving, and performance correlated with social
      information processing measures. Such difficulties may lead to problems in social
      functioning and warrant early intervention.

PG  - e526-33
LID - 10.1542/peds.2008-2423 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of American Indian children born
      just before and just after a sibling with fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete
      fetal alcohol syndrome. METHODS: Two retrospective case-control studies were
      conducted of Northern Plains American Indian children with fetal alcohol syndrome
      or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome identified from 1981 to 1993 by using
      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
      code 760.71. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the 39 siblings born just
      before children with fetal alcohol syndrome (study 1) and 30 siblings born just
      before children with incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome (study 2) had more facial 
      dysmorphology (23.1% and 16.7%, respectively), growth delay (38.5% and 10.0%),
      and central nervous system impairment (48.7% and 33.3%). The 20 siblings born
      just after children with fetal alcohol syndrome (study 1) and 22 siblings born
      just after children with incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome (study 2) had more
      facial dysmorphology (20.0% and 9.1%, respectively), growth delay (45.0% and
      22.7%), and central nervous system impairment (50.0% and 31.8%) than the control 
      siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The "before" siblings had characteristics of fetal alcohol
      syndrome that could have predicted that the next child was at risk for fetal
      alcohol syndrome. The "after" siblings had better outcomes than the previous
      siblings with fetal alcohol syndrome, a finding that was associated with a
      decrease in maternal alcohol consumption during the after-sibling pregnancy.

TI  - Neurobehavioural outcomes of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A
      Canadian perspective.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is one of the most common preventable
      causes of developmental disability and is currently one of the most pressing
      public health concerns in Canada. FASD refers to the range of physical, mental,
      behavioural and learning disabilities that an individual may acquire as a result 
      of maternal alcohol consumption. Prenatal exposure to alcohol leads to numerous
      primary and secondary disabilities in affected children, which can result in poor
      long-term outcomes. The present paper reviews previous research on the
      neurobehavioural outcomes of children with FASD, particularly in terms of
      behavioural, mental health and adaptive outcomes. The role of risk and protective
      factors on these outcomes and the impact of FASD on the family are also examined.
      Finally, future directions and implications regarding outcomes research among
      children with FASD, particularly within a Canadian context, are discussed.

AB  - A comprehensive neuropsychological/psychiatric, MR imaging, (MRI), MR
      spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) assessment was administered to
      children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global
      and/or focal abnormalities could be identified, and distinguish diagnostic
      subclassifications across the spectrum. The four study groups included: 1.
      FAS/Partial FAS; 2. Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed (SE/AE); 3.
      Neurobehavioral Disorder/Alcohol Exposed (ND/AE); and 4. healthy peers with no
      prenatal alcohol exposure. fMRI outcomes are reported here. The
      neuropsychological/psychiatric, MRI, and MRS outcomes are reported separately.
      fMRI was used to assess activation in seven brain regions during performance of
      N-back working memory tasks. Children across the full spectrum of FASD exhibited 
      significant working memory deficits and altered activation patterns in brain
      regions that are known to be involved in working memory. These results
      demonstrate the potential research and diagnostic value of this non-invasive MR
      tool in the field of FASD.

      children: results from a population-based prospective study.
PG  - 283-9
LID - 10.1097/CHI.0b013e318195bcfb [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relation between prenatal smoking and child behavioral problems
      has been investigated in children of school age and older, but prospective
      studies in younger children are lacking. Using the population-based prospective
      Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, we examined the risk for externalizing
      behaviors among 18-month-old children after exposure to maternal smoking during
      pregnancy. METHOD: Participants were 22,545 mothers and their 18-month-old
      children. Mothers reported their smoking habits at the 17th week of gestation and
      their child's externalizing behavior at 18 months of age by means of standardized
      questionnaires. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, with scores of
      externalizing behavior above the 88.6th percentile as the dependent variable and 
      self-reported smoking as the independent variable. We examined the child's sex as
      a possible moderator. RESULTS: We documented a threshold effect of smoking 10
      cigarettes or more per day during pregnancy on subsequent externalizing behaviors
      among 18-month-old children, even after adjusting for relevant confounders (odds 
      ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.70). The child's sex did not moderate 
      these effects (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.83-1.16). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Maternal smoking during pregnancy increases offspring's subsequent risk for
      externalizing behavior problems at 18 months of age. The pattern of risk does not
      differ between boys and girls. Our findings suggest a population attributable
      risk of 1.75% [corrected] (i.e., the proportion of externalizing cases that could
      potentially be avoided if prenatal smoking was eliminated or reduced to fewer
      than 10 cigarettes per day).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), resulting from maternal
      alcohol use during pregnancy, are associated with significant academic and
      behavior problems. Although affected children are common in clinical practice,
      information to guide recommendations about interventions with this high risk
      group is very limited. This study evaluated the persistence of effects of an
      intervention on the math performance and behavior of 54 children, 3- to 10-years,
      diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome or FASD. METHODS: Children were randomly
      assigned to a 6-week Math intervention (n = 28) tailored to this clinical group
      or to a standard psychoeducational contrast group (n = 26). All caregivers
      received identical educational interventions to promote learning readiness and
      improve behavioral outcomes. In a previous study, participants were assessed
      before interventions and immediately following completion. In this follow-up
      study, participants were recontacted and reassessed at 6 months post completion
      to determine if positive results on math functioning and child behavior would
      persist after treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: Focus was on 2 outcomes: (1)
      Math performance, assessed using standardized measures of math achievement and
      (2) Behavior problems as reported by caregivers on the Child Behavior Checklist
      (CBCL) and teachers on the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Experimental-group
      participants demonstrated significantly greater scores on math outcome measures
      than Contrast group members and CBCL and TRF behavior was improved over pretest
      scores in both groups. CONCLUSION: This 6-month follow-up confirms that both math
      skills and behavior of alcohol-affected children are improved significantly by
      interventions designed to meet their specific learning and behavior needs.

TI  - Approaches to assessment of alcohol intake during pregnancy in Swedish maternity 
      care--a national-based investigation into midwives' alcohol-related education,
      knowledge and practice.
PG  - 430-4
LID - 10.1016/j.midw.2008.10.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate how much education midwives in Sweden have undertaken to
      help them assess alcohol intake during pregnancy, and what tools they use to
      identify women who may be at risk of drinking during pregnancy. DESIGN: a
      national survey was conducted in March 2006, using a questionnaire constructed by
      a Swedish team of researchers and clinicians. SETTING: maternity health-care
      centres in Sweden. PARTICIPANT: 2106 midwives. FINDINGS: nearly all midwives
      stated that they had excellent or good knowledge concerning the risks associated 
      with drinking during pregnancy. They considered themselves less knowledgeable
      about detecting pregnant women with risky alcohol consumption before pregnancy.
      The majority of the midwives had participated in some education in handling risky
      drinking. Almost half of the midwives assessed women's alcohol intake before
      pregnancy. Important facilitators for increased activity concerned
      recommendations and decisions at different levels (national, local and
      management) on how to address alcohol with expectant parents and work with risky 
      drinkers. KEY CONCLUSIONS: more education was associated with more common use of 
      a questionnaire for assessment of women's alcohol intake before pregnancy, and
      more frequent counselling when identifying a pregnant woman whose pre-pregnancy
      consumption was risky.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Review of published studies of birth defects of the renal, liver, and 
      gastrointestinal organ systems in subjects with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders 
      (FASD). METHOD: We searched PubMed (http://www.pubmed.gov) using the following
      terms: fetal alcohol syndrome and: gastrointestinal tract, kidney, liver, and
      congenital abnormalities for all years and English only citations. RESULTS: We
      located 12 studies of FASD and defects of or functional impairments for the
      liver, 12 of renal abnormalities, and only two with gastrointestinal defects. We 
      did not identify specific patterns of malformations or functional deficits for
      any of the three organ systems. The existing literature suggests a series of
      nonspecific outcomes in FASD. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
      includes a diagnostic category of alcohol-related birth defects which is
      clinically difficult to apply. This study adds to the existing literature on
      birth defects in FASD which is still very limited. The categorical diagnosis of
      alcohol-related birth defects requires additional research to determine if a
      specific pattern of organ specific abnormalities or functional deficits emerges
      in subjects with FASD.

      prevalence and risk factors.
PG  - 877-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, characteristics and risk factors for fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS among schoolgoing children in Grade 1 in
      Northern Cape Province, South Africa. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using a
      two-tiered method for ascertainment of FAS/partial FAS cases, comprising:
      screening of growth parameters, diagnostic assessment for screen-positive
      children using clinical and neurocognitive assessments, and maternal history of
      drinking during pregnancy. Mothers or caregivers of FAS children and matched
      controls were interviewed. SETTING: Primary schools in De Aar (8) and Upington
      (15). Subjects. Grade 1 pupils in 2001 (De Aar, N=536) and 2002 (Upington,
      N=1299). OUTCOME MEASURES: FAS or partial FAS. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      FAS/partial FAS was high: 64/536 (119.4/1000, 95% CI 93.2-149.9) in De Aar, and
      97/1299 (74.7/1 000, 95% CI 61.0-90.3) in Upington. Overall, 67.2 per 1000
      children (95% CI 56.2-79.7) had full FAS features. Growth retardation was also
      common in this population: 66.6% (1181/1774) were underweight, 48.3% (858/1776)
      stunted, and 15.1% had a head circumference <2 SD for age. Mothers of children
      with FAS were less likely to have full-time employment or have attended secondary
      school and had lower body mass index, and about 80% currently smoked. Over
      two-thirds of all pregnancies had been unplanned. CONCLUSIONS: A very high
      proportion of pupils (nearly 1 in 10) had FAS/partial FAS, the rate in De Aar
      being the highest yet described in South Africa. FAS/partial FAS may contribute
      to the extremely high rate of growth retardation in South Africa as a whole and
      is a major cause of learning disability. These epidemiological features are
      important in designing preventive interventions.

PG  - 688-97

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic prenatal alcohol exposure causes a spectrum of deleterious
      effects in offspring, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
      (FASD), and deficits in executive function are prevalent in FASD. The goal of
      this research was to test the hypothesis that children with FASD exhibit
      performance deficits in tasks that assess attention, planning and spatial working
      memory. METHODS: Subjects (8-15 years male and female children) with a diagnosis 
      of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), or alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and age- and sex-matched controls, completed 
      four tasks selected from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery
      (CANTAB). RESULTS: Compared with age-matched control children (n = 92), subjects 
      with FASD (n = 89) exhibited longer reaction and decision times (effect size
      range; Cohen's d = .51 to .73), suggesting deficits in attention. Children with
      FASD demonstrated deficits in planning and spatial working memory that became
      more pronounced when task difficulty increased. The largest effect size in this
      study population (Cohen's d = 1.1) occurred in the spatial working memory task.
      Only one outcome measure revealed differences across the diagnostic subgroups,
      although all groups were different from control. CONCLUSION: This study
      demonstrates that deficits in multiple executive function domains, including set 
      shifting, planning and strategy use, attention and spatial working memory, can be
      assessed in children with FASD using an easy to administer, brief battery of
      computer-based neuropsychological tasks. The tasks appear to be equally sensitive
      for brain injury resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol, regardless of the
      presence of facial dysmorphology.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.
PG  - 977-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy leads to fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorder (FASD) in their children. FASD is characterized by typical facial
      features, growth retardation, intellectual dysfunction and behavioral problems.
      JUSTIFICATION: Alcohol is neurotoxic to the brain during the developmental stage.
      Behavioral problems in children with FASD start at an early age and progress to
      adulthood. It is an important preventable cause of intellectual dysfunction and
      behavioral problems. This article reviews current prevalence, clinical features, 
      pathogenesis and differential diagnosis of FASD. It also highlights the need for 
      physicians to be aware of this condition. SEARCH STRATEGY: Articles were searched
      on the internet using fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,
      women and alcohol. Following links were used to locate journals; EBSCO, OVID,
      Science Direct, PubMed and NIAAA. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy can lead to a spectrum of deficits. Though physical features are
      essential to make the diagnosis of FAS, it is important to note that
      neurocognitive and behavioural deficits can be present in the absence of physical
      features (alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder or ARND). Because there is 
      no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, abstinence from
      alcohol for women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy must be strongly
      advised.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to alcohol during gestation is associated with CNS
      alterations, cognitive deficits, and behavior problems. This study investigated
      microstructural aspects of putative white matter abnormalities following prenatal
      alcohol exposure. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess white
      matter microstructure in 27 youth (age range: 8 to 18 years) with (n = 15) and
      without (n = 12) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Voxelwise
      analyses, corrected for multiple comparisons, compared fractional anisotropy (FA)
      and mean diffusivity (MD) between groups, throughout the cerebrum. RESULTS:
      Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with low FA in multiple cerebral areas, 
      including the body of the corpus callosum and white matter innervating bilateral 
      medial frontal and occipital lobes. Fewer between-group differences in MD were
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide an account of cerebral white matter
      microstructural integrity in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and support extant 
      literature showing that white matter is a target of alcohol teratogenesis. The
      white matter anomalies characterized in this study may relate to the
      neurobehavioral sequelae associated with gestational alcohol exposure, especially
      in areas of executive dysfunction and visual processing deficits.

TI  - Binge drinking during pregnancy and risk of seizures in childhood: a study based 
      on the Danish National Birth Cohort.
PG  - 313-22
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwn334 [doi]
AB  - Seizures are often found in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, but it is not
      known whether binge drinking during pregnancy by nonalcoholic women is associated
      with an increased risk of seizure disorders in children. The authors conducted a 
      population-based cohort study of 80,526 liveborn singletons in the Danish
      National Birth Cohort (1996-2002). Information on maternal binge drinking (intake
      of > or = 5 drinks on a single occasion) was collected in 2 computer-assisted
      telephone interviews during pregnancy. Children were followed for up to 8 years. 
      Information on neonatal seizures, epilepsy, and febrile seizures was retrieved
      from the Danish National Hospital Register. Results showed that exposure to binge
      drinking episodes during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of
      seizure disorders in children, except for those exposed at 11-16 gestational
      weeks. These children had a 3.15-fold increased risk of neonatal seizures (95%
      confidence interval: 1.37, 7.25) and a 1.81-fold increased risk of epilepsy (95% 
      confidence interval: 1.13, 2.90). These findings suggest that maternal binge
      drinking during a specific time period of pregnancy may be associated with an
      increased risk of specific seizure disorders in the offspring. The results are
      exploratory, however, and need to be replicated.

TI  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on hippocampal volume, verbal learning, and 
      verbal and spatial recall in late childhood.
PG  - 1022-33
LID - 10.1017/S1355617708081368 [doi]
AB  - Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) show deficits in verbal learning
      and spatial memory, as well as abnormal hippocampal development. The relationship
      between their memory and neuroanatomic impairments, however, has not been
      directly explored. Given that the hippocampus is integral for the synthesis and
      retrieval of learned information and is particularly vulnerable to the
      teratogenic effects of alcohol, we assessed whether reduced learning and recall
      abilities in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are
      associated with abnormal hippocampal volumes. Nineteen children with FASDs and 18
      typically developing controls aged 9 to 15 years were assessed for verbal
      learning and verbal and spatial recall and underwent structural magnetic
      resonance imaging. Images were analyzed for total intracranial volume and for
      right and left hippocampal volumes. Results revealed smaller left hippocampi and 
      poorer verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall performance in children with
      FASDs than controls, as well as positive correlations between selective memory
      indices and hippocampal volumes only in the FASD group. Additionally, hippocampal
      volumes increased significantly with age in controls only, suggesting that PAE
      may be associated with long-term abnormalities in hippocampal development that
      may contribute to impaired verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall.

TI  - Rural-urban differences in provider practice related to preconception counselling
      and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - 180-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the most common form of
      nongenetic birth defect in North America with devastating, long-term
      consequences. Physicians are the primary providers of medical care for pregnant
      women and they play an important role in the prevention and diagnosis of FASD. We
      sought to determine whether differences exist between rural and urban health care
      providers in knowledge of, attitudes about and awareness of FASD and
      preconception counselling. METHODS: Surveys were mailed to a national, random
      sample of Canadian health care providers (n = 5361) between October 2001 and May 
      2002. Bivariate data analysis was completed using SPSS 14.0. RESULTS: Compared
      with their urban counterparts, rural providers were more likely to report being
      prepared to access resources related to alcohol use and dependency, yet they were
      less likely to agree that it was the physician's role to manage these issues
      (78.4% v. 82.8%, p < 0.05). Rural providers were more likely than urban providers
      to use a standardized tool to screen patients for alcohol use, to ask all
      pregnant women if they were drinking, to have cared for a patient with an FASD
      (56.7% v. 48.8%), to agree that providers do not make a diagnosis because of lack
      of time and training, and to recognize legal issues and inappropriate behaviour
      as secondary outcomes of FASD. Rural and urban providers were similar in their
      diagnostic knowledge of FASD. CONCLUSION: Few differences between rural and urban
      providers exist with regard to knowledge and diagnosis of FASD; however, rural
      providers are more prepared to access resources for women with addiction issues
      and are more likely to care for patients with an FASD.

TI  - Increased mortality among women who drank alcohol during pregnancy.
PG  - 603-10
LID - 10.1016/j.alcohol.2008.06.004 [doi]
AB  - Women giving birth to children with fetal alcohol syndrome have a higher risk of 
      early mortality. However, the risk of increased mortality associated with
      drinking at lower levels during pregnancy has not been evaluated previously.
      Accordingly, mortality at 20 years post recruitment was examined in a sample
      (N=570) of women recruited between 1980 and 1986, who drank more than 1 ounce of 
      absolute alcohol per week (oz AA/wk) during pregnancy and compared to that in
      abstainers from the same low socioeconomic, African-American population. Using
      data from archival information and state mortality records, Cox proportional
      hazards survival models were constructed to determine whether alcohol use,
      cigarette use, infant birth weight, infant dysmorphia, and alcohol use and abuse 
      by the woman's own mother (family history positive) were associated with
      increased risk for mortality. At follow-up (in 2003), 9.5% of the sample had
      died, with the rate for controls being 3.6%, for those alcohol users who stopped 
      during pregnancy, 12.7%, and for the alcohol users who continued drinking
      throughout pregnancy, 12.5%. Thus, women using alcohol in pregnancy, whether they
      stopped or continued to use, were significantly (chi2 (2)=12.1, P<.01) more
      likely than abstainers to have died before follow-up. Nondrinkers' mortality rate
      was lower than that of other women from this low-income, high-risk population,
      whereas the drinkers' rate was 2.7 times higher. In a multivariate analysis,
      factors contributing to mortality risk included alcohol use and cigarette
      smoking, but not infant birth weight. Drinking at any level during pregnancy
      should be regarded as a risk factor for the mother as well as for offspring.
      Health care professionals working with such women should provide counseling and
      support for abstinence.

TI  - Neuropsychological study of FASD in a sample of American Indian children:
      processing simple versus complex information.
PG  - 2136-48
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2008.00802.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a large body of literature exists on cognitive functioning
      in alcohol-exposed children, it is unclear if there is a signature
      neuropsychological profile in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders
      (FASD). This study assesses cognitive functioning in children with FASD from
      several American Indian reservations in the Northern Plains States, and it
      applies a hierarchical model of simple versus complex information processing to
      further examine cognitive function. We hypothesized that complex tests would
      discriminate between children with FASD and culturally similar controls, while
      children with FASD would perform similar to controls on relatively simple tests. 
      METHODS: Our sample includes 32 control children and 24 children with a form of
      FASD [fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) = 10, partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) = 
      14]. The test battery measures general cognitive ability, verbal fluency,
      executive functioning, memory, and fine-motor skills. RESULTS: Many of the
      neuropsychological tests produced results consistent with a hierarchical model of
      simple versus complex processing. The complexity of the tests was determined "a
      priori" based on the number of cognitive processes involved in them.
      Multidimensional scaling was used to statistically analyze the accuracy of
      classifying the neurocognitive tests into a simple versus complex dichotomy.
      Hierarchical logistic regression models were then used to define the contribution
      made by complex versus simple tests in predicting the significant differences
      between children with FASD and controls. Complex test items discriminated better 
      than simple test items. The tests that conformed well to the model were the
      Verbal Fluency, Progressive Planning Test (PPT), the Lhermitte memory tasks, and 
      the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT). The FASD-grouped children, when compared with
      controls, demonstrated impaired performance on letter fluency, while their
      performance was similar on category fluency. On the more complex PPT trials
      (problems 5 to 8), as well as the Lhermitte logical tasks, the FASD group
      performed the worst. CONCLUSIONS: The differential performance between children
      with FASD and controls was evident across various neuropsychological measures.
      The children with FASD performed significantly more poorly on the complex tasks
      than did the controls. The identification of a neurobehavioral profile in
      children with prenatal alcohol exposure will help clinicians identify and
      diagnose children with FASD.

TI  - Inconsistent report of pre-pregnancy-recognition alcohol use by Latinas.
PG  - 857-64
LID - 10.1007/s10995-008-0416-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared pregnant Latinas' report of alcohol use for the
      3-month period before pregnancy recognition with two different methods of data
      collection, in an attempt to identify opportunities for improved screening.
      METHODS: Data were collected for 53 pregnant Latinas who have ever drunk alcohol 
      and who were receiving services at Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinics in 
      San Diego, California. This study compared alcohol use reported during in-depth
      research interviews conducted in homes, to responses to an alcohol screening
      question administered by WIC staff. RESULTS: Latinas were more likely to report
      alcohol use for the 3-month period before pregnancy recognition at the in-depth
      home interview than their reported date of last drink to the WIC clinic would
      indicate (70% vs. 15%, respectively). Of importance, 57% of home interview
      reports that were positive for pre-pregnancy-recognition alcohol use would not
      have been identified by their reported date of last drink to the WIC screening
      question. Younger age, higher income, and earlier recognition of pregnancy were
      associated with under-reporting of pre-pregnancy-recognition alcohol use.
      CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of pre-pregnancy-recognition alcohol use may be influenced
      by the circumstances and scope of the screening questions employed, and varies by
      respondent's characteristics. Asking about pre-pregnancy-recognition alcohol use,
      i.e., alcohol consumed before pregnancy is recognized, may improve identification
      of low-income pregnant Latinas who may benefit from targeted intervention
      services.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the likelihood that women
      of different racial and ethnic groups would reduce their alcohol consumption
      during pregnancy. METHODS: Data came from 22 states participating in the
      Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System from 2001 to 2005. After stratifying 
      the sample by preconception drinking level, logistic regressions were used to
      predict drinking reduction and cessation by the third trimester by race,
      controlling for age, education, marital status, Medicaid status, pregnancy
      intention, smoking status, and state. RESULTS: Overall, Black, Asian/Pacific
      Islander and Hispanic women were all significantly less likely than White women
      to reduce their heavy drinking after becoming pregnant. American Indian/Alaskan
      Native women who were moderate drinkers before conception were over 2 times more 
      likely than White women to reduce drinking after becoming pregnant (OR 2.19, CI
      0.71, 6.76), although this difference was non-significant (P = .17). Among those 
      who binge drank in the months before pregnancy, compared to White women, Black
      (OR 0.26, CI 0.17-0.39), Hispanic (OR 0.19, CI 0.12-0.29), American
      Indian/Alaskan Native (OR 0.44 CI 0.20, 0.96), and Asian/Pacific Islander women
      (OR 0.11, CI 0.06-0.22) were all less likely to quit binge drinking while
      pregnant. CONCLUSION: Significant racial differences in pregnancy-related
      drinking reduction are evident, and may help explain racial disparities in FAS.
      Results suggest that more targeted efforts are needed to meet the national goals 
      of preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies.

TI  - A diagnostically promising technique for tallying nominal reference errors in the
      narratives of school-aged children with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).
PG  - 570-94
LID - 10.1080/13682820701698960 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) include the range of
      disabilities that occur in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy, with
      Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) on the severe end of the spectrum. Clinical
      research has documented a range of cognitive, social, and communication deficits 
      in FASD and it indicates the need for diagnostic tools that can identify children
      with diminished communicative capacities resulting from prenatal alcohol
      exposure. Previous research indicates that analysis of nominal reference errors
      within narrative discourse may provide such a tool. AIMS: To demonstrate the
      potential diagnostic utility of a new tool for tallying nominal reference errors 
      in the oral narratives of school-aged children with FASD by presenting
      quantitative measurement data that address interrater agreement and predictive
      accuracy. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Retrospective analysis was conducted on
      spontaneously produced oral narratives from 32 school-aged children (8;5-11;7)
      with a range of socio-economic and ethnic profiles. Sixteen of the children had
      been previously diagnosis with an FASD, including five with full or partial FAS
      (pFAS). The remaining 16 children were considered typically developing (TD). A
      range of methods for calculating the rate of nominal reference errors (rNRE) were
      used to predict which narratives were produced by children from each group.
      Accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) for two predictions (FASD versus TD, and
      FAS/pFAS versus all others) was quantified using receiver-operating
      characteristic curve analyses. Pairwise statistical comparisons were made between
      methods to determine which had the most diagnostic potential. OUTCOMES & RESULTS:
      The proposed system for calculating the rNRE was highly accurate at predicting
      which narratives were produced by children with FASD (versus TD, 88% overall
      accuracy), and which were produced by children with FAS/pFAS (versus all others, 
      97% overall accuracy), and outperformed all other methods tested. Agreement on
      coding decisions between independent judges was high (kappa = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS:
      The strong predictive accuracy demonstrated in this study provides empirical
      evidence that the system proposed in this feasibility study has sufficient
      sensitivity and diagnostic utility to warrant further development for use with
      children suspected of prenatal alcohol exposure. It also points to the potential 
      for the tool to be used with other clinical populations that, even in the absence
      of a confirmed alcohol exposure, share many of the communication challenges of
      this complex clinical population.

TI  - Markers of oxidative stress and systemic vasoconstriction in pregnant women
      drinking > or =48 g of alcohol per day.
PG  - 1893-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2008.00773.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The precise pathway by which alcohol causes the characteristic
      features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is unknown. Proposed mechanisms for 
      fetal injury from maternal alcohol use include cellular damage from oxidative
      stress and impaired fetal oxygenation related to maternal systemic
      vasoconstriction. Our objective was to compare the levels of urinary markers of
      oxidative stress and systemic vasoconstriction between women consuming large
      amounts of alcohol during pregnancy and women who did not drink alcohol during
      pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women consuming > or =48 g alcohol per day (n = 29) 
      on average and pregnant women who abstained from alcohol use (n = 39) were
      identified using detailed interviews and home visits. Random maternal urine
      specimens were collected. Urinary levels of the oxidative stress marker,
      8-isoprostane F2alpha, and of the vasoactive prostaglandin metabolites,
      2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (a vasodilator) and 11-dehydro-thromboxane
      B2 (a vasoconstrictor), were measured using mass spectrometric methods. All
      analyte levels were corrected for urinary creatinine. RESULTS: In crude analyses,
      there was no significant difference in 8-isoprostane F2alpha between pregnant
      drinkers and nondrinkers (2.16 vs. 2.08 ng/mg creatinine, respectively, p =
      0.87). There were no significant differences between the drinking and nondrinking
      groups in levels of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (1.03 vs. 1.17 ng/mg
      creatinine, respectively, p = 0.50), 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (0.72 vs. 0.59
      ng/mg creatinine, respectively, p = 0.21), or the ratio of vasodilatory
      metabolite to vasoconstrictive metabolite (1.73 vs. 2.72, respectively, p =
      0.14). Adjusting for maternal age, marital status, smoking, and gestational age
      at sampling did not substantially alter the results. CONCLUSION: Our results show
      no difference in levels of urinary eicosanoid markers of oxidative stress and
      systemic vasoconstriction between pregnant women who drink heavily and pregnant
      women who abstain. These findings speak against a role for maternal oxidative
      stress or systemic vasoconstriction in the pathogenesis of alcohol damage to the 
      fetus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have a variety
      of cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments, including structural
      brain damage. Despite the importance of white matter connections for proper brain
      function, little is known about how these connections, and the deep gray matter
      structures that act as relay stations, are affected in children with FASD. The
      purpose of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging, an advanced magnetic
      resonance imaging technique, to examine microstructural differences of white and 
      deep gray matter in children with FASD. METHODS: Subjects were 24 children aged
      5-13 years previously diagnosed with FASD and 95 healthy children over the same
      age range. Diffusion tractography was used to delineate 10 major white matter
      tracts in each individual, and region-of-interest analysis was used to assess 4
      deep gray matter structures. Fractional anisotropy, an indicator of white matter 
      integrity, and mean diffusivity, a measure of the average water diffusion, were
      assessed in all 14 brain structures. RESULTS: Diffusion tensor imaging revealed
      significant differences of diffusion parameters in several areas of the brain,
      including the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, cingulum, corticospinal
      tracts, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior and superior longitudinal 
      fasciculi, globus pallidus, putamen, and thalamus. Reduced white and gray matter 
      volumes, as well as total brain volume, were observed in the FASD group.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate diffusion abnormalities in FASD beyond the
      corpus callosum and suggest that several specific white matter regions,
      particularly commissural and temporal connections, and deep gray matter areas of 
      the brain are sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure.

PG  - 1098-109
LID - 10.1080/10826080801914121 [doi]
AB  - This study examines the relationship between physical abuse and periconceptional 
      drinking in women presenting to a mid-Atlantic, urban hospital-based OB/GYN
      clinic serving a largely indigent population between April 2003 and May 2004.
      During their first prenatal visit, 308 women completed a screening battery that
      included the Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS) and measures of alcohol use, including
      the CAGE, T-ACE, TWEAK, and the PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ).
      Bivariate analyses, including odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
      (CIs), revealed that women with a history of physical abuse were more likely to
      report drinking alcohol within the 3 months prior to their prenatal care visit
      and were significantly more likely to meet criteria for risk drinking on multiple
      measures. A history of physical abuse appears to be associated with higher
      self-reported rates of periconceptional drinking in pregnant women. Study
      findings support the need for assessment of abuse history as a potential risk
      factor for alcohol use in pregnant women.

      STUDY DESIGN: We screened 9628 pregnant women and identified 101 women who were
      drinking >/= 2 oz of absolute alcohol per day and 101 nondrinking control women. 
      We followed 43 exposed and 55 control offspring between age 4 and 9 years,
      performing masked standardized ophthalomologic examinations. RESULTS: The groups 
      did not differ in their rates of impaired visual acuity, refractory errors,
      ptosis, epicanthal folds, or short palpebral fissures. Biomicroscopy examination 
      was normal in all exposed subjects; cataracts were detected in 2 control subjects
      (4%) but in no exposed subjects. Arterial tortuosity was seen in 7 exposed
      subjects (16%) and in 8 control subjects (15%). Optic nerve hypoplasia was not
      detected in any subject. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research has found that children
      with FAS have a high incidence of serious ophthalmologic defects; our data
      indicate that the risk is limited to children with FAS and does not extend to
      children exposed to high levels of alcohol prenatally who do not develop FAS. Eye
      examinations are unlikely to clarify the diagnosis in children suspected of
      having alcohol-related damage.

TI  - Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure demonstrate deficits on multiple
      measures of concept formation.
PG  - 1388-97

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have documented
      impairments in executive functioning (EF). One component of EF, concept
      formation, has not been well studied in this group. METHODS: Children (8 to 18
      years) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with and without fetal 
      alcohol syndrome (FAS), were compared to typically developing controls on 2
      measures of concept formation and conceptual set shifting: the Wisconsin Card
      Sorting Test and the Card Sorting Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive
      Functioning System. In addition to between-group comparisons, performance
      relative to overall intellectual functioning was examined. RESULTS: Children with
      histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure showed impairment on both tests of
      concept formation compared to non-exposed controls. These deficits included
      difficulty generating and verbalizing concepts, increased error rates and
      perseverative responses, and poorer response to feedback. However, in comparison 
      to controls, alcohol-exposed children performed better on measures of concept
      formation than predicted by their overall IQ scores. Exploratory analyses suggest
      that this may be due to differences in how the measures relate at different IQ
      levels and may not be specific to prenatal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS:
      Deficits in concept formation and conceptual set shifting were observed in
      alcohol-exposed children with or without the diagnosis of FAS and in the absence 
      of mental retardation. These deficits likely impact problem solving skills and
      adaptive functioning and have implications for therapeutic interventions in this 
      population.

TI  - Pregnancy characteristics of women giving birth to children with fetal alcohol
      syndrome in Far North Queensland.
PG  - 240-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1479-828X.2008.00861.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been identified as a major cause of 
      impairment to normal physical and intellectual development among Indigenous
      children in Far North Queensland; however, little is known of the pregnancy
      characteristics of mothers of those children diagnosed with FAS or of
      interventions that might assist in lowering the prevalence of the syndrome. AIM: 
      To review the pregnancy records of women whose infants were subsequently
      diagnosed with FAS by the Paediatric Outreach Service (POS) of the Cairns Base
      Hospital, and to determine how such women might be identified prospectively in
      pregnancy and offered intervention to reduce alcohol consumption. METHODS: A
      retrospective case-control study involving all children diagnosed with FAS by the
      POS between 1994 and 2006; maternal pregnancy records were accessed and details
      obtained. RESULTS: Mothers of cases were older, of higher parity, smoked more
      cigarettes, attended fewer antenatal visits and experienced more antenatal and
      delivery complications than mothers of controls. The average gestational age at
      booking was not statistically significant between the two groups. There was a
      significant difference between the two groups in self-reported alcohol
      consumption both before and during pregnancy and in numbers of women who
      decreased alcohol consumption once the diagnosis of pregnancy was known to them. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There is the potential to identify prospectively women presenting
      for antenatal care who are heavy drinkers and risk FAS in their infants, using
      the self-reported information about alcohol intake already being collected by our
      service; such women may then be offered specific interventions to try to reduce
      alcohol consumption in pregnancy.

AB  - New draft alcohol guidelines for Australia state that, for pregnant women and
      women planning pregnancy, 'no drinking is the safest option'. One of the best
      known adverse effects of alcohol exposure on the fetus is the fetal alcohol
      syndrome. Others include alcohol-related birth defects, alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorders and increased risks of miscarriage, stillbirth,
      intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth and low birthweight. Over half of 
      Australian women consume alcohol during pregnancy. Obstetricians have a pivotal
      role in advising women of the effects of alcohol on the fetus and reducing fetal 
      exposure.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: New Zealand birth mothers' experiences.
PG  - e191-213
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the 'lived' experiences of New Zealand
      birth mothers, from pregnancy onwards, of a child/ren diagnosed with Fetal
      Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). METHOD: A qualitative paradigm was utilized so 
      that the participants could tell their stories through words and text rather than
      collecting statistical data which is the domain of quantitative research. The
      adoption of a feminist standpoint theory bridged a communication gap, adjusted
      the balance of power within society and gave visibility and voice to the women.
      Eight New Zealand-resident multipara biological mothers ages 18 and over, who had
      nurtured or were still living with their affected offspring, were studied. Their 
      ages ranged from 29 to 64. The mothers were interviewed in depth, face-to-face,
      using unstructured, open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using the constant
      comparative method. RESULTS: The mothers described a range of issues of concern
      for their disabled offspring and themselves (as advocates) relating to health,
      social, educational, judicial systems, lack of knowledge by professionals and
      problems in diagnosis, to being oppressed and stigmatized. Cognitive concerns for
      the offspring included attention-deficit, absence of fear, diminished memory and 
      comprehension and inability to acknowledge and understand consequences.
      Behavioural issues included excessive crying or no crying as a baby, lying,
      stealing, hyper-activity, aggressiveness, destructiveness, sexual promiscuity and
      few friends. Other issues of concern were delayed milestones and numerous health 
      problems. All mothers stated that the pregnancy, labour and delivery of their
      child with FASD were different from their other non-compromised
      pregnancies/labours/deliveries. Most mothers said that the doctors used medical
      language which they did not understand, thus giving power to the former. Seven
      mothers were either married to or partners of alcoholics when they conceived
      their offspring with FASD. All mothers had been drinking alcohol before becoming 
      pregnant. Six mothers came from drinking families. Most mothers continued to
      consume alcohol because they did not know that they had conceived. All mothers
      were unaware of FASD and its effects on the unborn child. Eight babies had low
      Apgar scores with an average of 6 (out of 10) and low birth weight (average 6lb
      2oz). An Apgar score is a numerical expression of an infant's condition, usually 
      determined at 60 seconds after birth, based on heart rate, respiratory efforts,
      muscle tone, reflex irritability and colour. All women were of middle to high
      socio-economic status. Seven mothers experienced family breakdown as a result of 
      alcohol consumption by the biological father of the child with FASD. All women
      feared for their child's future. CONCLUSION: Health, social, educational,
      judicial professionals, policy-makers and agencies, need to understand and be
      educated in the daily realities and complex problems that children with FASD and 
      their families face. Only then will the correct diagnosis be made so that these
      individuals can receive the nurturing, needs, education, funding and support they
      require in order to live full and meaningful lives and have the quality of life
      they deserve.

      acid ethyl esters in meconium.
PG  - 487-93
LID - 10.1002/bdra.20464 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was a review of published studies
      utilizing measurement of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) in meconium as biomarkers
      for prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: We completed a literature search of
      PubMed using the terms meconium, fatty acid ethyl esters, biomarkers, and
      prenatal alcohol exposure. We included only peer reviewed studies utilizing
      analysis of meconium for the presence of FAEE in humans through the year 2007.
      RESULTS: We found 10 articles reporting on original research examining the
      relationship of FAEE from meconium and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The 10
      articles used six different PAE assessment strategies and four different
      analytical techniques for determining FAEE endpoints. The articles included 2,221
      subjects (range 4 to 725) with 455 (20.5%) subjects identified as exposed using
      the methods stated in the articles. FAEE levels above the studies' respective
      cutoffs were reported for 502 (22.6%) subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The accurate
      identification of alcohol-exposed pregnancies represents a significant challenge 
      in the development of FAEE detection cutoffs to maximize the sensitivity and
      specificity of the test. We present several options for the improvement of
      exposure assessment in future studies of FAEE as biomarkers for PAE.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Review of the prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHD) and fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). DESIGN: We conducted a search of the Medline
      and Pubmed databases to identify papers reporting the association. We then
      searched the reference lists of the papers and reference books for additional
      sources. RESULTS: We found 29 studies that met our inclusion criteria. In the 12 
      case series studies of subjects with FASD, the proportion of cases with a CHD
      (atrial [ASD] and ventricular [VSD] septal defects, other defects, or unspecified
      CHD) ranged from 33% to 100%. From the 14 retrospective studies, the rate of
      septal defects was 21%, other structural defects 6% and unspecified defects was
      12%. For the 2 case-control studies, the odds of CHD ranged from 1.0 (subjects
      with fetal alcohol effect) to 18.0 (subjects with fetal alcohol syndrome). In the
      1 prospective study of CHD the OR for a child to have CHD and FASD was 1.0. KEY
      CONCLUSION: Pediatric cardiologists may have frequent contact with children with 
      FASD and increased levels of attention to prenatal alcohol exposure as a
      potential etiology of CHD is indicated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is well known that France has a cultural history of
      alcohol use, no recent French data on alcohol consumption during pregnancy in a
      large sample are available. METHODS: To determine the alcohol consumption
      patterns among pregnant women in France, we analyzed data from a 1-year
      multicenter self-survey. Sociodemographic profile, obstetrical history, neonatal 
      data, and a self-report for assessing drinking patterns during pregnancy
      including AUDIT were recorded from women who delivered recently. Cases of fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS) were also reported. RESULTS: A total of 837 pregnant women
      have described all parameters. The mean age at delivery of our sample was 29.7
      years (SD = 4.8 years). A total of 52.2% of women indicated that they had
      consumed alcohol at least once during their pregnancy, and among abstainers 54.5%
      had a positive AUDIT score. Of the pregnant women who consumed alcohol, 13.7%
      reported at least one binge drinking episode (5 or more drinks on 1 occasion)
      during pregnancy. Binge drinking is significantly more frequent than regular
      alcohol consumption (at least 1 drink more than 1 time per week) during
      pregnancy. A prevalence rate of FAS of 1.8 per 1,000 live births was observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: There is a large population of women who still drink alcohol during 
      pregnancy, particularly in binge drinking episodes. This underlines the need to
      clearly inform women of childbearing age about the dangers of alcohol during
      pregnancy as related to all types of consumption. Moreover, acting to prevent
      alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy may also greatly influence prenatal
      drinking.

TI  - Maternal risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome and partial fetal alcohol
      syndrome in South Africa: a third study.
PG  - 738-53
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2008.00634.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This is a third exploration of risk factors for the two most severe
      forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
      and Partial FAS (PFAS), in a South African community with the highest reported
      prevalence of FAS in the world. METHODS: In a case control design, interview and 
      collateral data concerning mothers of 72 first grade children with FAS or PFAS
      are compared with 134 randomly selected maternal controls of children from the
      same schools. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the mothers of 
      FASD children and controls in socio-economic status, educational attainment, and 
      a higher prevalence of FASD among rural residents. The birth order of the index
      children, gravidity, and still birth were significantly higher among mothers of
      FASD children. Mothers of children with a FASD are less likely to be married and 
      more likely to have a male partner who drank during the index pregnancy. Current 
      and gestational alcohol use by mothers of FASD children is bingeing on weekends, 
      with no reduction in drinking reported in any trimester in 75 to 90% of the
      pregnancies that resulted in an FAS child or during 50 to 87% of PFAS-producing
      pregnancies. There was significantly less drinking among the controls in the
      second and third trimesters (11 to 14%). Estimated peak blood alcohol
      concentrations (BAC)s of the mothers of PFAS children range from 0.155 in the
      first trimester to 0.102 in the third, and for mothers of FAS children the range 
      is from 0.197 to 0.200 to 0.191 in the first, second, and third. Smoking
      percentage during pregnancy was significantly higher for mothers of FASD children
      (82 to 84%) than controls (35%); but average quantity smoked is low in the 3
      groups at 30 to 41 cigarettes per week. A relatively young average age of the
      mother at the time of FAS and PFAS births (28.8 and 24.8 years respectively) is
      not explained by early onset of regular drinking (mean = 20.3 to 20.5 years of
      age). But the mean years of alcohol consumption is different between groups,
      16.3, 10.7, and 12.1 years respectively for mothers of FAS, FASD, and drinking
      controls. Mothers of FAS and PFAS children were significantly smaller in height
      and weight than controls at time of interview. The child's total dysmorphology
      score correlates significantly with mother's weight (-0.46) and BMI (-0.39).
      Bivariate correlations are significant between the child's dysmorphology and
      known independent demographic and behavioral maternal risk factors for FASD:
      higher gravidity and parity; lower education and income; rural residence; drinks 
      consumed daily, weekly, and bingeing during pregnancy; drinking in all
      trimesters; partner's alcohol consumption during pregnancy; and use of tobacco
      during pregnancy. Similar significant correlations were also found for most of
      the above independent maternal risk variables and the child's verbal IQ,
      non-verbal IQ and behavioral problems. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal data in this
      population are generally consistent with a spectrum of effects exhibited in the
      children. Variation within the spectrum links greater alcohol doses with a
      greater severity of effects among children of older and smaller mothers of lower 
      socio economic status in their later pregnancies. Prevention is needed to address
      known maternal risk factors for FASD in this population.

      white women.
PG  - 505-12

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although epidemiological data indicate that White women are more
      likely to drink and binge drink before pregnancy, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is
      more common in the Black population than among Whites in the United States.
      Differences in drinking cessation between Black and White women who become
      pregnant may help explain the disparity in FAS rates. METHODS: The study sample
      was comprised of 280,126 non-Hispanic Black and White women, ages 18 to 44, from 
      the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2001 to 2005 data sets.
      Predictors of reduction in alcohol consumption (in drinks per month) and binge
      drinking (>4 drinks on one occasion) by pregnant and non-pregnant women were
      identified with logistic regression. The effect of interactions of pregnancy
      status with age, education, and Black or White race on drinks per month and binge
      occasions were explored using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Pregnant
      White women averaged 79.5% fewer drinks per month than non-pregnant White women
      (F = 1250.1, p < 0.001), and 85.4% fewer binge drinking occasions (F = 376, p <
      0.001). Pregnant Black women averaged 58.2% fewer drinks per month than
      non-pregnant Black women (F = 31.8, p < 0.001) and 64.0% fewer binge occasions (F
      = 13.8, p < 0.001). Compared to Black women, White women appear to make a 38%
      greater reduction in drinks per month, and a 33% greater reduction in binge
      occasions. CONCLUSIONS: Non-Hispanic White women appear more likely to reduce
      drinks per month and binge drinking occasions than non-Hispanic Black women
      during pregnancy. These findings may help explain disparities in FAS in the
      United States, though this cross-sectional sample does not permit claims of
      causation. To better describe the impact of differential drinking reduction on
      FAS rates, future studies of longitudinal data should be done.

      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - 1313-9
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5067-07.2008 [doi]
AB  - Brain structural abnormalities and neurocognitive dysfunction have been observed 
      in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Little is known
      about how white matter integrity is related to these functional and morphological
      deficits. We used a combination of diffusion tensor and T1-weighted magnetic
      resonance imaging to evaluate white matter integrity in individuals with FASDs
      and related these findings to neurocognitive deficits. Seventeen children and
      adolescents with FASDs were compared with 19 typically developing age- and
      gender-matched controls. Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) was observed in
      individuals with FASDs relative to controls in the right lateral temporal lobe
      and bilaterally in the lateral aspects of the splenium of the corpus callosum.
      White matter density was also lower in some, but not all regions in which FA was 
      lower. FA abnormalities were confirmed to be in areas of white matter in post hoc
      region of interest analyses, further supporting that less myelin or disorganized 
      fiber tracts are associated with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Significant
      correlations between performance on a test of visuomotor integration and FA in
      bilateral splenium, but not temporal regions were observed within the FASD group.
      Correlations between the visuomotor task and FA within the splenium were not
      significant within the control group, and were not significant for measures of
      reading ability. This suggests that this region of white matter is particularly
      susceptible to damage from prenatal alcohol exposure and that disruption of
      splenial fibers in this group is associated with poorer visuomotor integration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Characteristics of Northern Plains American Indian maternal
      grandmothers who had grandchildren with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or
      incomplete FAS are described to more effectively prevent fetal FAS and alcohol
      use during pregnancy. METHODS: Study 1 had 27 maternal grandmothers who had
      grandchildren with FAS and Study 2 had 18 grandmothers with grandchildren who had
      incomplete FAS (cases) which were compared with 119 maternal grandmothers who had
      grandchildren without FAS (controls). The grandchildren were born between 1981
      and 1993 on the Northern Plains. Medical records were manually reviewed for each 
      case and control grandmother. Data were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel chi
      square. RESULTS: Study 1 case grandmothers were more likely to experience medical
      problems (70.4%) including trauma (48.1%) and injuries (51.9%) than the controls.
      Most of the Study 1 and 2 case grandmothers (92.6% and 77.8%, respectively) had
      alcohol use documented in their medical records compared to less than half of the
      control grandmothers. Seven (15.6%) of the case grandmothers had more than one
      grandchild in either Study 1 or Study 2. CONCLUSION: Maternal grandmothers who
      had grandchildren with FAS had significantly higher rates of alcohol use and
      alcohol-related medical problems than control grandmothers. Antenatal care
      providers should screen pregnant women for alcohol use at their first visit. The 
      provider needs to ask the women who are using alcohol about their mothers' use of
      alcohol to provide appropriate care and counseling for the women and prevent FAS.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome related knowledge assessment and comparison in New Jersey 
      health professional groups.
PG  - e57-65
AB  - BACKGROUND There is a need to educate health professionals in regard to Fetal
      Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders across many health and
      allied health fields. OBJECTIVE Conduct evaluations of educational programs
      designed to assess knowledge, attitudes and beliefs in relation to Fetal Alcohol 
      Spectrum Disorders (FASD) among health and allied health professionals in the
      northeastern United States. METHODS FASD related educational efforts were carried
      out and evaluated in New Jersey for various health-related professional groups
      over a four-month period using a common set of materials. Pre and post-test
      evaluation comprised 20 questions on FASD recognition, diagnosis, treatment, and 
      prevention. Groups surveyed included nurses, social workers, counselors,
      therapists, clinicians and allied health professionals comprising physician
      assistants, dieticians, physical therapists, occupational therapists. RESULTS
      Results showed that a majority of health care professionals in New Jersey possess
      basic knowledge related to FASD and the effects of alcohol on a child in utero.
      They also had significant awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and the 
      importance of reducing secondary disabilities. The study did however reveal areas
      for improvement in some professional groups. CONCLUSIONS FASD is the most
      important preventable cause of mental retardation. Health professionals attending
      workshops typically had a good basic understanding of FASD, though with some
      weaknesses specific to their discipline. Educational efforts in regard to FASD
      should be sensitive to the various health professionals engaged in preventing,
      diagnosing and treating FASD.

AB  - Preventing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) by encouraging pregnant women to abstain 
      from drinking alcohol competes with commercial alcohol marketing. Two
      FAS-prevention campaigns using a narrowcast approach among young women of
      childbearing age in two disadvantaged Southern California communities are
      compared. The design, implementation process, and degree to which campaigns
      reached the priority populations are the focus of this article. Formative
      research shows that young women in disadvantaged communities receive mixed
      messages about dangers of drinking during pregnancy. A social norms approach
      using positive role models was the most acceptable message strategy based on
      materials pretesting. Differences in campaign implementation and distribution
      strategies between communities were documented through program monitoring. Survey
      research indicated the more viable messaging and implementation strategies.
      Findings show that low-cost community campaigns are feasible; however, variations
      in messaging, distribution strategies, and saturation levels determine whether
      such campaigns succeed or fail to reach priority populations.

PG  - 119-29
AB  - Children with either fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) display deficits in attention and
      executive function (EF) and differential diagnosis of these two clinical groups
      may be difficult, especially when information about prenatal alcohol exposure is 
      unavailable. The current study compared EF performance of three groups: children 
      with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC); nonexposed children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); and typically developing
      controls (CON). Both clinical groups met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The EF
      tasks used were the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Controlled Oral Word 
      Association Test (COWAT), and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Results indicated
      different patterns of deficit; both clinical groups displayed deficits on the
      WCST and a relative weakness on letter versus category fluency. Only the ALC
      group displayed overall deficits on letter fluency and a relative weakness on
      TMT-B versus TMT-A. In addition, WCST performance was significantly lower than
      expected based on IQ in the ADHD group and significantly higher than expected in 
      the ALC group. These results, which indicate that, although EF deficits occurred 
      in both clinical groups, the degree and pattern of deficit differed between the
      ALC and ADHD groups, may improve differential diagnosis.

TI  - Impacts of alcohol use in pregnancy--the role of the GP.
PG  - 935-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a preventable cause of developmental 
      delay and growth failure. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the clinical features
      of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the role of the general
      practitioner in prevention and management. DISCUSSION: Early diagnosis of and
      intervention for problems associated with FAS reduce adverse long term outcomes. 
      Most health professionals have limited knowledge of FASD and lack confidence in
      the diagnosis and management of children with FASD. General practitioners have an
      important role in identifying women and children at risk of harm from alcohol and
      arranging referral for assessment and management when necessary. Educational
      materials for health professionals are currently under development.

TI  - Hearing in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).
PG  - e307-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol is the most prevalent human teratogen affected by early
      exposure of the fetus. Although not listed as a major part of the fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder (FASD), different texts list hearing loss as a characteristic
      of the FASD, based on several small studies. OBJECTIVE: To characterize hearing
      in children with FASD, diagnosed in the Motherisk Program in Toronto. DESIGN:
      Cross sectional cohort study. SETTING: Academic referral center. PATIENTS:
      Children 4-16 years of age that met criteria for FASD, with no other known risk
      factor for sensorineural hearing loss. A consecutive sample of 41 children (13
      girls, mean age 8.9 +/-3 years) was collected. INTERVENTION: Physical
      examination, audiometry and tympanometry. OUTCOME MEASURES: External and middle
      ear pathology on physical examination, pure tone average (PTA), speech reception 
      threshold (SRT), discrimination and tympanometry. Results were compared to
      reference values in the normal population. Hearing loss equal or greater than
      16dB hearing-level in each frequency tested was considered to be clinically
      significant. RESULTS: A total of 5 (11.2%) of children had hearing loss of at
      least 16dB hearing-level, mostly unilateral. SRT was within the normal range in
      40 (98%) of children with FASD and discrimination was normal in all children.
      None had auricular or external canal dysmorphology. 14.7% of the children had
      frequent episodes of acute otitis media. Middle ear effusion was detected in 8
      ears (9.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of mild sensorineural hearing loss in
      children diagnosed with FASD (16dB hearing-level or greater) was not higher than 
      expected in this age group. However, because children with FASD are academically 
      and behaviorally challenged, early detection of hearing loss and early
      intervention is warranted.

TI  - Knowledge and attitudes about fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders, and alcohol use during pregnancy by occupational therapists in the
      Midwest.
PG  - e203-20
AB  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) occurs in approximately 3 of 1,000 live births in
      the general population of the U.S. and is the leading known cause of mental
      retardation. The Midwest Regional Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Training Center
      (MRFASTC) surveyed 1,000 licensed occupational therapists (OT) of the American
      Occupational Therapists Association in a six-state Midwest region, including
      Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas to assess knowledge and 
      attitudes regarding FAS. Nearly 20% of the OTs responded. Of the respondents,
      nearly 94% regarded at least 1 drink per day as being 'heavy' in a pregnant
      woman. There was an increase in the number of respondents who thought it was
      acceptable to consume 1 drink or more with each advancing trimester of pregnancy.
      92% of the OTs indicated a willingness to counsel a mother of a child having FAS,
      but 96% indicated a poor to fair ability to select valid and reliable assessment 
      instruments for screening a child for FAS. Only 6% of the OT respondents
      indicated a good-excellent ability to conduct brief interventions on alcohol
      cessation for women. The data collectively indicate OTs possess similarities to
      other health care providers, including physicians and psychologists, in the
      misunderstanding or deficits of knowledge and skills associated with FAS and that
      they are largely unprepared to provide intervention for women 'at risk' for FAS, 
      or to recognize correctly FAS in children. There is a demonstrated need, and
      desire, by the practicing OTs for continued education related to alcohol abuse
      associated with FAS.

TI  - Fetal alcohol exposure, iron-deficiency anemia, and infant growth.
PG  - 559-67
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our goals were to determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure is
      associated with an increased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in infancy and
      to compare effects of fetal alcohol exposure and iron-deficiency anemia on infant
      growth. We also tested whether effects of fetal alcohol exposure on growth are
      mediated or moderated by iron-deficiency anemia. METHODS: A total of 96 infants
      born to mothers from the Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South 
      Africa, were recruited prenatally; 42 mothers drank heavily during pregnancy, and
      54 abstained or drank small amounts of alcohol. Growth was assessed at birth and 
      6.5 and 12 months, and iron-deficiency anemia was assessed at 6.5 or 12 months.
      RESULTS: Infants whose mothers binge drank during pregnancy (> or = 4 drinks per 
      occasion) were 3.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia 
      at 12 months than were infants whose mothers did not binge drink. Prenatal
      alcohol exposure was associated with reduced weight at birth, 6.5 months, and 12 
      months and with shorter length at 6.5 and 12 months. Iron-deficiency anemia was
      related to reduced 12-month weight and head circumference and to slower growth
      velocity between 6 and 12 months. The effects of prenatal alcohol on weight were 
      not mediated by iron-deficiency anemia; however, they were seen primarily in
      infants with iron-deficiency anemia. CONCLUSIONS: The association of maternal
      binge drinking with an increased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia may reflect 
      disruption of accumulation of fetal iron stores or postnatal deficiencies in iron
      uptake, absorption, or intake. Moreover, iron deficiency seems to exacerbate the 
      prenatal alcohol effects on growth.

TI  - Health-related effects of genetic variations of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes in
      African Americans.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Alcohol metabolism involves two key enzymes-alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and
      aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). There are several types of ADH and ALDH, each of
      which may exist in several variants (i.e., isoforms) that differ in their ability
      to break down alcohol and its toxic metabolite acetaldehyde. The isoforms are
      encoded by different gene variants (i.e., alleles) whose distribution among
      ethnic groups differs. One variant of ADH is ADH1B, which is encoded by several
      alleles. An allele called ADH1 B*3 is unique to people of African descent and
      certain Native American tribes. This allele is associated with more rapid
      breakdown of alcohol, leading to a transient accumulation of acetaldehyde.
      African Americans carrying this allele are less likely to have a family history
      of alcoholism and experience a less rewarding subjective response to alcohol.
      Moreover, children of mothers with this allele are less vulnerable to
      alcohol-related birth defects. The enzyme ALDH1 also is encoded by several
      alleles. Two of these alleles that are found in African Americans-ALDH1 A1 *2 and
      ALDH1A1 *3--may be associated with a reduced risk of alcoholism.

      it is associated with certain positive effects, excessive drinking and alcohol
      disorders can exert a negative effect on the marital development and on the
      development of children in the context of the family. This review considers
      evidence that alcohol influences and is influenced by marital/family processes,
      including transitions into marriage and parenthood, marital satisfaction, marital
      violence, parenting, and child development. The review discusses the importance
      of antisocial behavior and the need to examine women's drinking, and the joint
      impact of men's and women's drinking on marital/family processes. The review
      highlights the lack of studies in certain key areas, including the link between
      discordant drinking and violence and marital satisfaction, the role of alcohol in
      child neglect, and the potential role of marital conflict as a mediator or
      moderator of the relationship between alcohol and child functioning.

TI  - Use of focus groups in developing FAS/FASD prevention in Russia.
PG  - 881-94
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a severe outcome of alcohol use during pregnancy, and
      the rates may be higher in countries with greater use of alcohol. To obtain
      information from Russian physicians (N = 23), women (N = 23), and male partners
      (N = 5), focus groups were conducted with 51 participants in St. Petersburg,
      Russia. The main objective was to determine the participants' knowledge,
      attitudes, and behavior related to drinking during pregnancy. Data were analyzed 
      using ATLAS-ti 5.0. The results will be used to develop a survey of Russian
      professionals and women leading to FAS prevention programming. The study's
      limitations are described.

TI  - Research-based interventions for children and youth with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorder: revealing the gap.
PG  - 389-97; discussion 398-400
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use during pregnancy can result in a continuum of effects
      including growth deficits, dysmorphology and/or complex patterns of behavioural
      and cognitive difficulties that influence an individual's functioning throughout 
      their lifespan. We conducted a systematic review to identify research-based
      interventions for children and youth with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and
      areas for future study. METHODS: We identified the substantive literature by
      searching 40 peer-reviewed and 23 grey literature databases, as well as reference
      lists. We hand-searched eight relevant journals, and undertook a systematic
      search of Internet sites and review of reports and documents received from key
      stakeholders. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and quality, and
      extracted data. Given the small number of studies that met all inclusion
      criteria, both experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included.
      RESULTS: Ten intervention studies were identified, of which three were
      experimental or quasi-experimental, and four were non-experimental. Despite
      multiple attempts, three studies (two in foreign languages and one unpublished)
      could not be acquired. A meta-analysis could not be undertaken because the
      included studies examined different interventions or outcomes. Interventions
      targeted in the included studies were as follows: (i) psychostimulant medications
      (methyphenidate, pemoline and dextroamphetamine); and (ii) Cognitive Control
      Therapy. The identified studies were limited by very small sample sizes and weak 
      designs. CONCLUSION: There is limited scientific evidence upon which to draw
      recommendations regarding efficacious interventions for children and youth with a
      Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Clinicians, researchers, service providers,
      educators, policy makers, affected children and youth and their families, and
      others need to urgently collaborate to develop a comprehensive research agenda
      for this population.

TI  - A review of policies on alcohol use during pregnancy in Australia and other
      English-speaking countries, 2006.
PG  - 466-71
AB  - It is well accepted that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a risk
      factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, but research findings for exposure to
      low to moderate alcohol levels during pregnancy are equivocal, allowing a range
      of interpretations. The 2001 guideline from the National Health and Medical
      Research Council (NHMRC) for low-risk drinking for "women who are pregnant or
      might soon become pregnant" recommends fewer than seven standard drinks per week,
      and no more than two standard drinks on any one day. This position has polarised 
      health professional and consumer opinion in Australia. The NHMRC guidelines on
      alcohol are scheduled for review in 2007. We surveyed the alcohol and pregnancy
      policies and clinical practice guidelines of Australia and six other
      English-speaking countries to identify current policy. Documents were obtained
      through Internet searches and direct contact with the relevant organisations. The
      policies and guidelines varied both across and within countries, and the NHMRC
      guideline, while not universally supported in Australia, is in step with the
      policies of the United Kingdom and Canada. Research is needed to elucidate the
      true association between low to moderate alcohol consumption and fetal harm, the 
      impact of different policies on rates of maternal alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy, and any untoward outcomes of an abstinence message, to inform and
      underpin future policy development in Australia.

TI  - Abnormal cortical thickness and brain-behavior correlation patterns in
      individuals with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 136-44
AB  - Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in children with fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) have shown regional patterns of dysmorphology,
      most prominent in parietal and posterior temporal cortices. Various methods of
      image analysis have been employed in these studies, but abnormalities in cortical
      thickness have not yet been mapped over the entire cortical surface in
      individuals with FASD. Further, relationships between cognitive dysfunction and
      cortical thickness measures have not yet been explored. We applied cortical
      pattern matching algorithms and techniques for measuring cortical thickness in
      millimeters to the structural brain MRI images of 21 subjects with heavy prenatal
      alcohol exposure (8-22 years, mean age 12.6 years), and 21 normally developing
      control subjects (8-25 years, mean age 13.5 years). Dissociable cognitive
      measures, of verbal recall and visuospatial functioning, were correlated with
      cortical thickness, and group by test score interactions were evaluated for
      predicting cortical thickness. Significant cortical thickness excesses of up to
      1.2 mm were observed in the FASD subjects in large areas of bilateral temporal,
      bilateral inferior parietal, and right frontal regions. Significant group by test
      score interactions were found in right dorsal frontal regions for the verbal
      recall measure and in left occipital regions for the visuospatial measure. These 
      results are consistent with earlier analyses from our own and other research
      groups, but for the first time, we show that cortical thickness is also increased
      in right lateral frontal regions in children with prenatal alcohol exposure.
      Further, the significant interactions show for the first time that brain-behavior
      relationships are altered as a function of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.

TI  - Limits of usual biochemical alcohol markers in cord blood at term: a
      fetal/maternal population-based study.
PG  - 546-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: After maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, many neonates
      affected by less apparent forms of fetal alcohol syndrome disorder (FASD) do not 
      receive proper diagnosis or treatment. There is thus a need for laboratory
      markers for early detection of alcohol-exposed neonates. The aim of our study was
      to assess the efficiency of the usual alcohol biomarkers measured in cord blood
      to identify alcohol-exposed neonates immediately after birth. METHODS: A 1-year
      study was conducted in the labor wards of the maternity units of the Auvergne,
      Central France at the time of term delivery. The patients answered an anonymous
      self-completion survey concerning alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder
      Identification Test; AUDIT) during their pregnancy. Aspartate aminotransferase,
      alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase concentrations and the
      percentage of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were measured in maternal and
      cord blood. RESULTS: We collected 870 maternal-fetal sample pairs. Two cases
      (0.2%) of typical FASD were detected. We report a non-significant correlation
      between maternal and cord blood biomarkers. None of the cord blood biomarkers
      differed significantly between newborns of alcohol-exposed and unexposed mothers.
      CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the usual alcohol biomarkers are not effective
      in cord blood for identifying alcohol-exposed neonates.

      school-age children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). METHOD: A
      case-defined diagnostic approach for measuring and reporting the full spectrum of
      disabilities in children with prenatal alcohol exposure is presented.
      Demographic, environmental, language, and social communication (as reflected by
      narrative discourse) data are reported for a large cohort of children with FASD
      between the ages of 6;0 (years;months) and 12;0. RESULTS: Children with FASD are 
      a heterogeneous group with varying levels of compromise. The data demonstrate a
      substantial comorbidity between the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and
      adverse caregiving environments. The data further reveal that school-age children
      with FASD often exhibit clinically meaningful deficits in language and social
      communication. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: Children with FASD may be particularly
      vulnerable to language and social communication deficits as a result of prenatal 
      alcohol exposure and atypical or adverse social interactive experiences.
      Comprehensive assessment is recommended. Dynamic and functional assessment
      paradigms may document the language and social communicative deficits in children
      with FASD and other clinical populations with complex neurodevelopmental
      profiles.

TI  - Estimating the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Victoria using routinely
      collected administrative data.
PG  - 62-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in
      Victoria through the Victorian Birth Defects Register (VBDR). METHODS: A sample
      of live births from 1995-2002 was selected from the Victorian Perinatal Data
      Collection and VBDR based on reported microcephaly, FAS or maternal use of
      alcohol during pregnancy. Following ethics approval, medical records of mother
      and child were requested for 117 births. One hundred and nine of these were
      accessed and examined for factors related to FAS. Records were categorised as
      FAS, possible FAS, unable to categorise, or not FAS. RESULTS: From the VBDR the
      prevalence was calculated at 0.006 per 1,000 live births. Four additional
      possible cases of FAS increased this to 0.014 per 1,000 live births. Six cases
      were defined as 'unable to categorise' as alcohol use was unknown but other
      features of FAS were evident. Including these cases, plus five where some
      low-level alcohol use was reported, increased the prevalence to 0.03 per 1,000
      live births. Twenty-eight per cent of the audit population and 39% of the
      microcephalic cases had no information about maternal alcohol use recorded in the
      antenatal or babies' records. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The audit of medical
      records provided additional information regarding FAS prevalence in Victoria.
      This prevalence ranges from 0.01 to 0.03 per 1,000 live births. To accurately
      assess the extent of the problem, there needs to be improved reporting of alcohol
      use in pregnancy and a system in place to report cases diagnosed during and
      beyond the perinatal period to the VBDR.

TI  - Patterns and average volume of alcohol use among women of childbearing age.
PG  - 437-45
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Maternal alcohol use is a leading preventable cause of
      neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities in children. This study examines 
      the patterns and average volume of alcohol use among U.S. women of childbearing
      age in order to identify subgroups of high-risk women for selective intervention.
      METHODS: A sample of 188,290 women aged 18-44 years participated in the Centers
      for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC)'s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
      System (BRFSS) survey during the period of 2001-2003. Reported alcohol use
      patterns and average volume were examined for pregnant and nonpregnant women.
      Efforts were made to evaluate and characterize women who practiced various levels
      of binge drinking. RESULTS: The results showed that approximately 2% of pregnant 
      women and 13% of nonpregnant women in the United States engaged in binge drinking
      during the period of 2001-2003. Among the estimated average of 6.7 million women 
      of childbearing age overall who engaged in binge drinking during the period,
      approximately 28.5% women also reported consuming an average of 5 drinks or more 
      on typical drinking days, or about 21.4% women consumed at least 45 drinks on
      average in a month. Larger proportions of binge drinkers with high usual quantity
      of consumption were found among women of younger ages (18-24 years) or current
      smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Future prevention efforts should include strategies that
      combine health messages and encourage women of childbearing age, with particular 
      emphasis on women 18-24 years, to avoid alcohol and tobacco use, and take
      multivitamins and folic acid daily for better pregnancy outcomes. Other efforts
      must also include broad-based implementation of screening and brief intervention 
      for alcohol misuse in primary and women's health care settings.

TI  - Evaluation of psychopathological conditions in children with heavy prenatal
      alcohol exposure.
PG  - e733-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the prevalence of psychopathological conditions in
      children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (N = 39) and nonexposed, typically 
      developing peers (N = 30), matched with respect to age, gender, and socioeconomic
      status. METHODS: Caregivers were interviewed with either the Kiddie Schedule for 
      Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and
      Lifetime Version, or the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children,
      Version IV. Statistical resampling methods were used to create 95% confidence
      intervals for the difference between the proportions of children with
      psychopathological conditions in the exposed and control groups. RESULTS: Group
      differences were seen in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depressive
      disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and specific phobia
      outcome categories. The group difference in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder category was by far the largest effect observed. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that fetal alcohol exposure should be considered a possible
      factor in the pathogenesis of childhood psychiatric disorders. These data provide
      clinically relevant information about the mental health problems that children
      with fetal alcohol exposure are likely to face.

TI  - Determining client need in a multi-state fetal alcohol syndrome consortium: from 
      training to practice.
PG  - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multi-state consortium was developed in the US to conduct baseline 
      data collection and intervention research on fetal alcohol syndrome. Each state
      employed support specialists whose job it was to reduce or eliminate alcohol
      consumption in women who were at high risk for drinking alcohol during their
      pregnancy. The purpose of this paper is to report how support specialists in
      three primarily rural/frontier states were trained to assess client need and how 
      client need was actually assessed in the field. METHODS: A qualitative process
      evaluation was conducted using semi-structured interviews. Interviews were
      conducted with state staff involved in support specialist training and consortium
      activities and the support specialists themselves. Inductive analyses were
      conducted with interview data. RESULTS: Need determination varied by state and
      for one state within the state. How support specialists were trained to assess
      need and how need was assessed in the field was mostly congruent. CONCLUSION:
      Process evaluation is an effective method for providing practical and useful
      answers to questions that cannot be answered by outcome evaluation alone.

TI  - Ocular manifestations in fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 104-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the prevalence of ocular abnormalities in a group of
      Portuguese children with a complete fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). METHODS:
      Complete ophthalmologic examination in a sample of consecutive children with FAS.
      Ocular fundus photography was carried out on the cooperative FAS children and on 
      25 reference children. Ocular fundus anomalies were recorded by the observation
      of ocular fundus photography. The ratio between the distance of the center of the
      disc to the fovea and optic disc diameter (DM/DD) was determined. Small optic
      disc was defined as a DM/DD ratio above mean control group +1 SD. RESULTS: The
      authors studied 32 children with FAS (mean age: 9 +/- 5 years; 72% boys). The
      mean corrected visual acuity (VA) was 0.8 +/- 0.2. Refraction ranged from -23.00 
      to +6.50 spherical equivalent. Ocular findings included short horizontal
      palpebral fissure (81% of children), strabismus (28% of children), epicanthus
      (27% of eyes), blepharoptosis (16% of eyes), telecanthus (13% of children),
      nystagmus (1 child), and cataract (1 eye). Ocular fundus photography analysis
      showed retinal vessel tortuosity in 30% of the eyes and optic disc hypoplasia in 
      25%. The mean DM/DD for the control and FAS groups was 2.72 +/- 0.20 and 2.89 +/-
      0.25 (p=0.001). Forty percent of the eyes of FAS children had small optic discs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The most common ocular findings were anomalies of retinal fundus and
      minor changes in the outer region of the eyes. The authors noted better VA and
      less severity of disease than others, which might be due to a different selection
      of patients, different pattern of alcohol consumption, or genetic differences.

TI  - Issues in estimating the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome: examination of 2
      counties in New York State.
PG  - e384-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Two demographically similar counties included in the New York Fetal
      Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network had very different prevalence rates. This
      study examined the components of the surveillance in an attempt to discover the
      reasons for this discrepancy. METHODS: Erie County and Monroe County were the 2
      most populous counties included in the New York Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
      Surveillance Network. Erie County includes Buffalo, the second largest city in
      New York State, and Monroe County includes Rochester, the third largest city.
      Multiple sources of ascertainment included birth defect surveillance systems,
      genetic clinics, and early intervention programs. The case definition was based
      on the Institute of Medicine criteria of an abnormality in each of the following 
      3 areas: facial features, central nervous system, and growth. RESULTS: Children
      born in Erie County or Monroe County between 1995 and 1999 were included. The
      fetal alcohol syndrome prevalence rates in these 2 counties were 0.90 cases per
      1000 births and 0.21 cases per 1000 births, respectively. The 2 counties were
      demographically similar and had similar rates of binge drinking among women of
      childbearing age. There was less participation in the surveillance system by
      sources in Monroe County. Erie County had a very active clinician with a
      specialized fetal alcohol syndrome clinic. CONCLUSIONS: The participation of
      clinicians in one county, especially one with expertise in fetal alcohol
      syndrome, was the most likely explanation for the differences in prevalence rates
      between the counties.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: historical perspectives.
PG  - 168-71
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the most severe manifestation of the adverse
      effects of alcohol on foetal development, was first described in the French
      medical literature by Lemoine et al. in 1968 [Les Gfants des parents alcholiques:
      anomalies observes a propos de 127 cas (The children of alchoholic parents:
      anomalies observed in 127 cases). Quert in Medicine 8, 476-482]. Five years
      later, Jones et al., 1973. Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic
      alcholic mothers. Lancet 1, 1129-1267] were the first to delineate systematically
      the association between maternal alcohol abuse and a specific pattern of birth
      defects and to provide diagnostic criteria for this condition. Several diagnostic
      systems have since been developed with a view to capturing the wide spectrum of
      physical and behavioral anomalies resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. The
      purpose of the current paper is to outline the evolution of FAS as a medical
      diagnosis.

TI  - Preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth
      defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. DESIGN: A randomized
      controlled trial (2002-2005; data analyzed 2005-2006) of a brief motivational
      intervention to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) in
      preconceptional women by focusing on both risk drinking and ineffective
      contraception use. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 830 nonpregnant women, aged
      18-44 years, and currently at risk for an AEP were recruited in six diverse
      settings in Florida, Texas, and Virginia. Combined settings had higher
      proportions of women at risk for AEP (12.5% overall) than in the general
      population (2%). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive
      information plus a brief motivational intervention (n=416) or to receive
      information only (n=414). The brief motivational intervention consisted of four
      counseling sessions and one contraception consultation and services visit. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Women consuming more than five drinks on any day or more than
      eight drinks per week on average, were considered risk drinkers; women who had
      intercourse without effective contraception were considered at risk of pregnancy.
      Reversing either or both risk conditions resulted in reduced risk of an AEP.
      RESULTS: Across the follow-up period, the odds ratios (ORs) of being at reduced
      risk for AEP were twofold greater in the intervention group: 3 months, 2.31 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI]=1.69-3.20); 6 months, 2.15 (CI=1.52-3.06); 9 months,
      2.11 (CI=1.47-3.03). Between-groups differences by time phase were 18.0%, 17.0%, 
      and 14. 8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A brief motivational intervention can
      reduce the risk of an AEP.

TI  - Clinical delineation of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in Italian
      children: comparison and contrast with other racial/ethnic groups and
      implications for diagnosis and prevention.
PG  - 270-7
AB  - In Italy, little is known about the spectrum of adverse fetal effects related to 
      maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. In this paper, we report on the phenotype 
      of Italian children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These data were
      gathered as part of a field study assessing the prevalence of FASD in children in
      an in-school study in a rural area near Rome. The purposes of this paper are: (1)
      to completely characterize the clinical phenotype of a large cohort of Italian
      children with FASD; (2) to correlate and contrast the phenotype of this
      population with that observed in other populations and reported in the medical
      literature; (3) to discuss the drinking habits of Italian women, before, during
      and after pregnancy; and (4) to suggest mechanisms for intervention and
      prevention of FASD based on data gathered from this study.

TI  - Promoting alcohol abstinence among pregnant women: potential social change
      strategies.
PG  - 45-67
AB  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD) is one of the most preventable sources of 
      developmental abnormalities, and has a singular cause-alcohol consumption during 
      pregnancy. Estimates for the costs of treatment of a single case of FASD range
      often above one million dollars. The primary strategy for prevention currently
      centers on no alcohol consumption during pregnancy. However, a sizeable number of
      North American women currently drink during pregnancy. A literature review
      examined the behavior of maternal alcohol consumption in order to understand the 
      rationale associated with drinking. Generally, it appears that pregnant women
      differ by their alcohol consumption habits and their reasons to drink. In an
      attempt to eliminate FASD, we review a number of educational, legal, and
      community-based programs that have been used to promote abstinence and examine
      where they have been successful. Unfortunately, social marketing strategies have 
      received less attention. Several potential applications of social marketing
      directed to drinking-during- pregnancy campaigns are suggested, and possible
      contributions to the overall effort are explained.

TI  - Reduction in newborns with discharge coding of in utero alcohol effects in the
      United States, 1993 to 2002.
PG  - 1224-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether use of the International Classification of
      Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for fetal alcohol
      effects has declined during the past 10 years among hospitalized newborns in the 
      United States. DESIGN: Trends in use of the ICD-9-CM code 760.71, "alcohol
      affecting the fetus," among newborns from 1993 through 2002 were compared with
      trends in self-reported drinking during pregnancy and maternal diagnoses of
      alcohol abuse during childbirth. SETTING: Sampled short-term, nonfederal general 
      and specialty hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Infants born from 1993 to 2002 in the
      United States who were included in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
      databases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Documentation of ICD-9-CM code 760.71 among
      newborns, self-reported drinking during pregnancy, and diagnoses of maternal
      alcohol abuse during childbirth from 1993 through 2002. RESULTS: The prevalence
      of the ICD-9-CM code 760.71 for alcohol affecting the fetus, as documented in the
      discharge record of newborns, declined from 0.73 (95% confidence interval,
      0.56-0.92) per 1000 live births in 1993 to 0.17 (95% confidence interval,
      0.13-0.20) per 1000 live births in 2002. Rates declined concurrently with those
      of self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy and diagnoses of maternal
      alcohol abuse during childbirth. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the ICD-9-CM code for
      alcohol affecting the fetus among newborns declined 75% throughout 10 years.
      Results may be due to decreases in drinking during pregnancy, decreases in
      disclosure of alcohol use by the mother, or more selective use of the discharge
      code. National hospital discharge databases may allow cost-effective monitoring
      of public health interventions that address rare conditions of the fetus and
      newborn.

TI  - Native Americans and alcohol: past, present, and future.
PG  - 435-51
AB  - Native Americans have higher rates of alcohol use, frequency of use, and
      increased rates of fetal alcohol syndrome, compared with other ethnic groups (J. 
      Hisnanick, 1992; P. A. May, 1996; J. M. Wallace et al., 2003). High prevalence
      rates of alcohol misuse among Native Americans must be understood in light of
      their unique history, which has resulted in trauma and exposure to many risk
      factors for problem alcohol use. Many risk factors have been identified in the
      general population; however, only some of these risk factors have been examined
      among Native American populations. The unique history and world view of Native
      Americans mean that, often, risk factors operate differently from the way they do
      in other populations. The authors discuss interventions and promising treatments.

TI  - Neuroimaging and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - 239-45
AB  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure causes permanent structural alterations to the
      brain and can lead to numerous cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Consistent with
      many of the neuropsychological and behavioral deficits that have been reported,
      neuroimaging studies reveal a pattern of structural abnormalities associated with
      prenatal alcohol exposure. This chapter systematically reviews structural
      anomalies by brain region, identifying cognitive and behavioral correlates when
      relevant. The consensus shows that in addition to the overall reduction of brain 
      size, prominent brain shape abnormalities have been observed, with narrowing in
      the parietal region and reduced brain growth in portions of the frontal lobe.
      Commensurating with these anomalies, volumetric and tissue density findings cite 
      disproportionate reductions in the parietal lobe, cerebellar vermis, corpus
      callosum, and the caudate nucleus, suggesting that certain areas of the brain may
      be especially vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure. In sum, neuroimaging
      techniques have greatly advanced our understanding of brain-behavior
      relationships in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and hopefully will lead
      to improved diagnosis and treatment options for those affected by prenatal
      exposure to alcohol.

TI  - [Alcohol consumption, pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome: implications in
      public health and preventive strategies].
PG  - 391-406
AB  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health problem and
      is an established cause of serious birth defects and developmental delay
      collectively described as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is caused by
      congenital alcohol-induced damages and is a cause of mental retardation. It is
      characterised by facial abnormalities and growth deficiency. Infants affected by 
      the syndrome show intellectual impairment, and difficulties in learning, memory, 
      problem-solving, and attention as well as experiencing additional problems with
      mental health and social interactions. However, an absence of the characteristic 
      facial defects and growth deficiency may result in a failure to identify children
      with prenatal alcohol exposure, which can further present as alcohol-related
      neurodevelopment disorder (ARND) or alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).
      Estimates of prevalence of FAS in U.S.A. range between 0.3 to 2.2 per 1,000 live 
      births, but much higher rates occurring in some communities. Harmonisation of the
      methodology used for epidemiological studies, with research activities that
      establishes real baseline prevalence of FAS and identification of women who are
      at highest risk of bearing a FAS-affected child, are an essential prerequisite to
      prevention. In addition, it is essential to assess different FAS preventive
      approaches through carefully controlled studies. Universal, selected, and
      indicated preventive strategies have been identified, targeting different kind of
      populations. Since FAS and other adverse effects of drinking during pregnancy are
      theoretically completely preventable, it is vital to make more efforts to improve
      the application of the most appropriate interventions. Although in Italy alcohol 
      consumption has constantly increased, mainly amongst the young (including women
      of childbearing age), knowledge on FAS and alcohol-related effects is completely 
      lacking. Because of the high cost for care of individuals with this syndrome, it 
      is essential to apply appropriate interventions to prevent this problem.

TI  - Brief intervention for prenatal alcohol use: the role of drinking goal selection.
PG  - 419-24
AB  - The behavioral problems and cognitive deficits resulting from even small amounts 
      of prenatal alcohol exposure can be significant and enduring but completely
      preventable. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a prenatal
      drinking goal selected during a brief intervention for 115 pregnant women and
      their partners on subsequent consumption. Higher proportions of women having
      their first pregnancy chose abstinence as a goal over drinking reduction. Goal
      selection was highly predictive of subsequent drinking behavior. Interestingly,
      the participants who were abstinent at enrollment and who chose to remain
      abstinent had the highest rates of abstinence. In contrast, the women who chose
      cutting down on drinking were the least likely to drink less subsequently,
      despite recognizing more situations putting them at risk for drinking and
      identifying more alternatives to consumption. We conclude that goal choice in
      behavioral self-management of alcohol use by pregnant women is critical.

TI  - Comparison of the 4-digit diagnostic code and the Hoyme diagnostic guidelines for
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - 1532-45
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and
      the Hoyme fetal alcohol spectrum disorders diagnostic guidelines differ markedly.
      The performances of the 2 diagnostic systems were compared. METHODS: The fetal
      alcohol syndrome diagnostic criteria from the 4-Digit Code and Hoyme guidelines
      were applied to 952 patients who had received an interdisciplinary, fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders, diagnostic evaluation at the University of Washington with
      the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and 16 children with confirmed absence of prenatal
      alcohol exposure. RESULTS: The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome was 3.7% with
      the 4-Digit Code and 4.1% with the Hoyme guidelines. Although the prevalences
      were similar, the patients identified were not. Only 17 individuals met the fetal
      alcohol syndrome criteria for both systems. An extraordinary number of patients
      (35%) met the Hoyme criteria for the fetal alcohol syndrome facial phenotype, but
      only 39 of those 330 patients met the Hoyme criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome. 
      Even some children with no alcohol exposure (25%) had the Hoyme fetal alcohol
      syndrome face. The specificities of the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome face for the
      Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome diagnosis and prenatal alcohol exposure were low in 
      these populations. CONCLUSIONS: Without a specific facial phenotype, a valid
      diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome cannot be rendered for patients with prenatal
      alcohol exposure, because a causal link between their outcomes and exposure
      cannot be established, and a valid diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome cannot be 
      rendered for patients with unknown alcohol exposure, because the face cannot
      serve as a valid proxy measure for alcohol exposure. Diagnostic guidelines must
      confirm the specificity of their fetal alcohol syndrome facial criteria to
      validate their diagnostic criteria.

TI  - Magnetic resonance and spectroscopic imaging in prenatal alcohol-exposed
      children: preliminary findings in the caudate nucleus.
PG  - 597-606
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging
      (MRSI) offer unique, noninvasive methods of measuring, respectively, in vivo
      quantitative neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. The main purpose of the present
      study was to identify and compare the neuroanatomical and neurochemical
      abnormalities that are associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol in both fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS)-diagnosed children and those diagnosed with fetal alcohol 
      effects (FAE). MR data of three age-, gender- and race-balanced groups of
      children, FAS-diagnosed, FAE-diagnosed and non-exposed controls, were compared.
      Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, regardless of diagnosis, were found in the 
      caudate nucleus. Specifically, a significantly smaller caudate nucleus was found 
      for the FAS and FAE participants compared to the controls. In addition, the
      metabolite ratio of N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr), an indicator of
      neuronal function, in left caudate nucleus of both the FAS and FAE participants
      was elevated compared to the control group. Analysis of absolute concentrations
      revealed that the increase in the ratio of NAA/Cr was due to an increase in NAA
      alone. Although its exact function in the CNS is unknown, NAA is believed to be a
      neuronal marker due to its exclusive localization to neurons. Some also speculate
      a role for NAA in myelination. Elevated NAA in the prenatal alcohol-exposed
      participants could indicate a lack of normal program cell death, dendritic
      pruning and/or myelination during development. The present study demonstrates
      that prenatal alcohol-exposed children, with or without facial dysmorphology,
      have abnormal brain anatomy and chemistry.

TI  - Games that "work": using computer games to teach alcohol-affected children about 
      fire and street safety.
PG  - 518-30
AB  - Unintentional injuries are a leading cause of death and disability for children. 
      Those with developmental disabilities, including children affected by prenatal
      alcohol exposure, are at highest risk for injuries. Although teaching safety
      skills is recommended to prevent injury, cognitive limitations and behavioral
      problems characteristic of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder make
      teaching these skills challenging for parents and teachers. In the current study,
      32 children, ages 4-10, diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial
      FAS, learned fire and street safety through computer games that employed "virtual
      worlds" to teach recommended safety skills. Children were pretested on verbal
      knowledge of four safety elements for both fire and street safety conditions and 
      then randomly assigned to one condition. After playing the game until mastery,
      children were retested verbally and asked to "generalize" their newly acquired
      skills in a behavioral context. They were retested after 1 week follow-up.
      Children showed significantly better knowledge of the game to which they were
      exposed, immediately and at follow-up, and the majority (72%) was able to
      generalize all four steps within a behavioral setting. Results suggested that
      this is a highly effective method for teaching safety skills to high-risk
      children who have learning difficulties.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: a practical clinical approach to diagnosis.
PG  - 230-8
AB  - In utero exposure to alcohol can have numerous adverse effects on a developing
      fetus. These effects represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and
      neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities that have recently been termed fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Children at the most severe end of this
      spectrum and displaying the complete phenotype of characteristic facial
      anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central
      nervous system are defined as having fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). While FAS is
      the most readily clinically recognized form of FASD, other categories within the 
      continuum of adverse effects due to prenatal alcohol exposure are becoming better
      defined. These include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related
      birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). As
      more is learned regarding the exact manifestations of alcohol on brain
      development, these classifications may be expanded and/or refined. Because FASD
      represents a major public health concern, early recognition of at-risk children
      is important for initiating interventional strategies. Thus, the purpose of this 
      report is to educate practicing physicians about the recognizable phenotypes of
      FASD in order to accurately identify these children and implement the most
      appropriate management plans.

TI  - In utero alcohol exposure and prediction of alcohol disorders in early adulthood:
      a birth cohort study.
PG  - 1009-16
AB  - CONTEXT: Little is known about the contribution of fetal alcohol exposure to the 
      development of alcohol disorders in early adulthood. OBJECTIVE: To examine the
      independent effect of maternal alcohol use during early vs late periods in
      pregnancy on the time of onset of alcohol disorders in offspring. DESIGN:
      Follow-up study of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy and Its 
      Outcomes (MUSP), a population-based birth cohort study commenced in Brisbane,
      Australia, in 1981 and designed to examine the association of maternal alcohol
      exposure with the onset of alcohol disorders. Mothers and children were followed 
      up at birth, 6 months, and 5, 14, and 21 years after the initial interview.
      Maternal alcohol use was assessed before pregnancy, in early and late pregnancy, 
      and at the 5- and 14-year follow-up visits. Alcohol disorders in early adulthood 
      were assessed at age 21 years using the lifetime version of the Composite
      International Diagnostic Interview-computerized version. SETTING:
      Population-based birth cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A subsample of 2138
      participants for whom complete data were available at the 21-year follow-up. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: Onset of alcohol disorder from adolescence to 21 years of age.
      RESULTS: In utero alcohol exposure of 3 or more glasses was associated with
      alcohol disorders. The fully adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of
      developing early-onset alcohol disorders at age 21 years were 2.95 (1.62-5.36)
      for those exposed to maternal drinking in early pregnancy and 1.35 (0.69-2.63)
      for those exposed in late pregnancy. There was also a strong association between 
      alcohol exposure in early pregnancy and late-onset alcohol disorders (odds ratio,
      3.29 [95% confidence interval, 1.74-6.24]). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide
      support for a biological origin of adult alcohol disorders and suggest that the
      association is not explained solely by maternal drinking or smoking during
      childhood and adolescence or other intervening factors. Further research is
      needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the association.

TI  - Characteristics of fathers who have children with fetal alcohol syndrome or
      incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 337-40
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determine alcohol use, referrals to treatment, receiving treatment,
      and medical problems related to alcohol among fathers who have children with FAS 
      or incomplete FAS. METHODS: Fathers who had American Indian children with FAS
      (Study 1) or incomplete FAS (Study 2) were compared with fathers whose children
      did not have FAS. RESULTS: About half of case and control fathers had alcohol use
      and alcohol-related medical problems documented in their medical records. Case
      fathers were more likely to receive alcohol treatment and have injuries related
      to alcohol abuse. CONCLUSION: Significantly more fathers of children with FAS
      were referred for alcohol treatment, received alcohol treatment, experienced
      injuries, and had delirium tremens than control fathers. Fathers of children with
      incomplete FAS were significantly more likely to drink alcohol, to have received 
      alcohol treatment, and to have alcohol-related medical problems and injuries than
      control fathers.

TI  - The alcoholism generator.
PG  - 1466-9
AB  - Alcohol exposure largely affects 3 populations: fetuses, adolescents, and adults.
      These 3 developmental stages are inextricably intertwined such that elevated
      alcohol exposure at any time increases the probability of exposure at the others.
      This circular interdependency is called the alcoholism generator. Furthermore,
      exposure to large amounts of alcohol at these 3 times can cause cognitive
      dysfunction, largely through mechanisms of alcohol-induced perturbations in
      neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Breaking this cycle is key to reducing problem
      alcohol drinking and the associated sequelae.

PG  - 1271-5
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are among the leading preventable causes
      of developmental disorders in the United States; however, recognition and
      prevention of these conditions cannot be achieved without informed and educated
      health providers. This commentary addresses the importance of recognition and
      prevention of FASDs through the use of well-established standardized practices of
      diagnosis, screening, and brief alcohol reduction counseling. It is hoped that
      more knowledge on currently available procedures will encourage their use in the 
      provision of routine health care to all women of childbearing age.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome and its long-term effects.
PG  - 211-8
AB  - Ancient scripture and paintings together with several medical reports on the
      effect of alcohol on the newborn over the past 300 years finally led to the
      description of the fetal alcohol syndrome in the 1970s by French and American
      research groups. Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can result in the
      specific pattern of malformations and neurocognitive deficits characteristic of
      this syndrome. Diagnostic criteria and classifications have been developed and in
      the 1990s reports showed the long-term consequences for these children. In recent
      years several studies from different countries have shown that prenatal alcohol
      exposure will lead to life-long consequences on physical development,
      intellectual development, behavior, social development, occupation, independence,
      sexuality or sexual behavior and increased risk of suicidality. In this review of
      long-term observation studies we found that the prenatal exposure to alcohol have
      permanent and life-long damage, which impair both the social and occupational
      future of the person exposed with a need for life-long assistance in order for
      that person to function at an optimal level. Primary prevention and early
      intervention with general public health educational efforts seems to be the best 
      way forward.

TI  - Do women change their drinking behaviors while trying to conceive? An opportunity
      for preconception counseling.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading cause of preventable mental
      retardation and developmental disabilities, including fetal alcohol syndrome.
      Current medical guidelines recommend that no alcohol should be consumed over the 
      period of conception and throughout pregnancy. Although the majority of women
      reduce alcohol consumption when they realize they are pregnant, this recognition 
      may not occur until well into the first trimester, potentially impacting
      embryonic development. OBJECTIVES: To describe and assess changes in patterns of 
      women's alcohol use between the preconception, pre-pregnancy recognition and
      post-pregnancy recognition time periods. Secondly, to describe characteristics of
      women consuming any alcohol and those binge drinking during pre- and
      post-pregnancy recognition periods. METHODS: Computer assisted telephone
      interviews were conducted with 1042 women who had recently delivered a baby in
      urban Alberta, Canada. Differences in consumption patterns between time periods
      were analyzed using analysis of variance and Chi-square tests. Characteristics of
      those drinking both before and after pregnancy recognition were analyzed using
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Eighty percent of women reported alcohol
      consumption pre-conceptually, 50% pre-pregnancy recognition and 18%
      post-pregnancy recognition. Binge drinking was reported by 32%, 11% and 0% for
      preconception, pre-pregnancy recognition and post-pregnancy recognition periods, 
      respectively. Alcohol consumption patterns (i.e., the mean number of drinks per
      drinking day and week) did not differ significantly between preconception and
      pre-pregnancy recognition periods but did significantly drop after pregnancy
      recognition (p<0.001). Alcohol use during the period of pre-pregnancy recognition
      was higher among those not planning a pregnancy, not using assisted reproductive 
      technology, of higher income, without a history of miscarriage, who were
      Caucasian, and who used tobacco. Binge drinking was higher among women not
      planning a pregnancy, those who used tobacco, and those with low self-esteem.
      Women continuing to drink small amounts of alcohol after pregnancy recognition
      were more likely to be between the ages of 30-39 years, be Caucasian and use
      tobacco. CONCLUSION: Preconception and "well-women" counseling strategies would
      be improved by increasing the emphasis on the risks of alcohol use during periods
      when pregnancy can occur.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome disorders: experience on the field. The Lazio study
      preliminary report.
PG  - 53-7
AB  - In Italy, little is known about the problems related to alcohol drinking during
      pregnancy. In this paper, the Italian literature about this subject is briefly
      reviewed. This first Italian experience of a field study, aimed to the assessment
      of the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD) in an area in the Rome province (Lazio region) is reported. This
      in-field study was performed in the school years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 in
      cooperation with American researchers, most from University of New Mexico
      (Albuquerque), and Italian researchers from University "la Sapienza" of Rome.
      First grade children (n(o) = 1,086) of primary school were contacted to enter in 
      the in-school study for the detection of FAS and FASD and were examined by the
      experts team of clinicians, pediatrics, psychologists. Preliminary consideration 
      and the implications of this study for FASD prevention are discussed.

PG  - 46-52
AB  - Over thirty years of research has revealed that prenatal exposure to alcohol has 
      a devastating impact on the structure and function of the developing central
      nervous system. Imaging studies over the past ten years have improved our
      understanding of the structural alterations related to prenatal alcohol exposure 
      and provided researchers with potential hypotheses for brain-behavior
      relationships. Structural alterations associated with prenatal alcohol exposure
      have been found in overall brain size, shape, and symmetry, along with regional
      decreases in white and gray matter. In addition, abnormalities have been noted in
      specific structures such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum.
      This review demonstrates that specific areas of the brain may be more vulnerable 
      to prenatal exposure to alcohol.

AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a large and rapidly increasing public health
      problem worldwide. Aside the full-blown FAS, multiple terms are used to describe 
      the continuum of effects that result from prenatal exposure to alcohol, including
      the whole fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The revised Institute of
      Medicine (IOM) Diagnostic Classification System and the diagnostic criteria for
      FAS and FASD are reported, as well as the formation of the four-state FAS
      International Consortium and its aims, as the development of an information base 
      that systematizes data collection that helps to determine at-high-risk
      populations, and to implement and test a scientific-based prevention/intervention
      model for at risk women. The Consortium was further enlarged, with the inclusion 
      of some more states (including Italy), leading to the formation of the
      International Consortium for the Investigation of FASD. The objectives of the
      Consortium are reported, as well as its previous activities, the South Africa and
      Italy Projects (active case ascertainment initiatives), and its future
      activities.

TI  - Letter and category fluency in children with fetal alcohol syndrome from a
      community in South Africa.
PG  - 502-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether there were differential effects of
      substantial prenatal alcohol exposure on letter and category fluency in children.
      Given that children with prenatal alcohol exposure are often impaired in
      executive functioning and that letter fluency taxes executive processes more than
      category fluency, it was expected that children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
      would be more impaired in letter than in category fluency. A second objective of 
      the study was to examine the developmental trends in the two types of fluency in 
      children with prenatal alcohol exposure. It was hypothesized that between the
      ages of 6 and 9 years, these FAS children would show age-related changes in
      category fluency but not in letter fluency. METHOD: As part of a
      neuropsychological test battery designed for an international collaborative study
      of FAS in South Africa, tests of letter and category fluency were administered in
      Afrikaans. The participants were 62 children with FAS and 61 controls matched
      with respect to age, gender (58 boys and 65 girls), ethnicity, and socioeconomic 
      status. RESULTS: Results showed that the FAS group had relatively greater
      difficulty with letter fluency than with category fluency and that the FAS group 
      generated fewer words in both fluency conditions. Contrary to the expectation,
      however, alcohol-affected children demonstrated age-related linear trends in both
      letter and category fluency. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of verbal
      fluency involving a large sample of well-diagnosed children with FAS conducted in
      a nonwestern environment. The results are nonetheless consistent with those
      obtained in western countries in studies of children with various levels of
      prenatal alcohol exposure and various levels of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. 
      This study suggests that at least some aspects of the cognitive profile
      associated with prenatal alcohol exposure may be generalizable across cultural
      and ethnic boundaries.

TI  - A retrospective review of self-reported alcohol intake among women attending for 
      antenatal care in Far North Queensland.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are known 
      to occur among children delivered to women in Far North Queensland; to date, the 
      problem has not been quantified or related directly to maternal alcohol
      consumption during pregnancy. AIMS: To identify the characteristics of women who 
      consume alcohol during pregnancy, in order to identify 'high-risk' women to whom 
      educational intervention regarding fetal alcohol syndrome may be targeted.
      METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study using the case notes of all women
      attending the antenatal booking clinic in Cairns Base Hospital over the 3-month
      period from April to June 2005. Obstetric and demographic information and
      self-reported alcohol intake before and during pregnancy were noted and
      self-reported alcohol intake before and during pregnancy. RESULTS: Five hundred
      and forty-one women were included in this study. Of these women, 24.6% were found
      to consume alcohol during pregnancy and 57.7% were found to consume alcohol
      before pregnancy, indicating a reduction in alcohol consumed once women became
      aware of pregnancy. The most significant indicator for alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy was found to be alcohol consumption before pregnancy. Of women who
      consumed alcohol in pregnancy, 71.5% drank moderate amounts of alcohol before
      pregnancy and 28.7% drank heavily before pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Alcohol
      consumption during pregnancy is common in Far North Queensland. Methods currently
      used during antenatal booking visits to determine alcohol consumption before and 
      during pregnancy are unreliable. Strategies to identify women consuming alcohol
      before and during pregnancy and education programs are vitally important if the
      incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome and spectrum disorder is to be reduced.

TI  - Identifying the behavioural phenotype in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder:
      sensitivity, specificity and screening potential.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: In most cases of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), the
      pathognomonic facial features are absent making diagnosis challenging, if not
      impossible, particularly when no history of maternal drinking is available. Also 
      because FASD is often comorbid with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD), children with FASD are frequently improperly diagnosed and receive the
      wrong treatment. Since access to psychological testing is typically limited or
      non-existent in remote areas, other diagnostic methods are needed to provide
      necessary interventions. OBJECTIVES: To determine if a characteristic behavioural
      phenotype distinguishes children with FASD from typically developing children and
      children with ADHD and use this information to create a screening tool for FASD
      diagnosis. METHODS: Parents and caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist
      (CBCL), a well-established standardized tool for evaluating children's
      behavioural problems. Results from 30 children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or
      Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disability, 30 children with ADHD, and 30
      typically developing healthy children matched for age and socioeconomic status
      with FASD were analyzed. Based on our previous work, 12 CBCL items that
      significantly differentiated FASD and control groups were selected for further
      analyses. Stepwise discriminant function analysis identified behavioural
      characteristics most strongly differentiating groups and Receiver Operating
      Characteristics (ROC) curve analyses determined sensitivity and specificity of
      different item combinations. RESULTS: Seven items reflecting hyperactivity,
      inattention, lying and cheating, lack of guilt, and disobedience significantly
      differentiated children with FASD from controls. ROC analyses showed scores of 6 
      or higher on these items differentiated groups with a sensitivity of 86%,
      specificity of 82%. For FASD and ADHD, two combinations of items significantly
      differentiated groups with high sensitivity and specificity (i) no guilt,
      cruelty, and acts young (sensitivity = 70%; specificity = 80% (ii) acts young,
      cruelty, no guilt, lying or cheating, steals from home, and steals outside
      (sensitivity = 81%; specificity = 72%). These items were used to construct a
      potential FASD screening tool. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identifying the
      behavioural characteristics differentiating children with FASD from typically
      developing children or children with ADHD have the potential for development of
      an empirically derived tool for FASD tool to be used in remote areas where
      psychological services are not readily available. This technique may speed up
      diagnosis and intervention for children without ready access to formal
      assessments.

TI  - Alcohol use by pregnant women: partners, knowledge, and other predictors.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The impact of a couple's knowledge about healthy pregnancy habits
      involving alcohol and substance use was assessed in the context of other factors 
      previously identified to predict prenatal alcohol consumption in a sample of 254 
      pregnant women and their male partners. METHOD: Couples were asked to assess
      independently a series of statements (true or false) describing the consequences 
      of prenatal substance exposure, while also providing information about their own 
      drinking. RESULTS: Although the couples demonstrated good knowledge of healthy
      habits during pregnancy, they did not agree when the element of chance was
      considered. Median household income was more highly predictive of a pregnant
      woman's knowledge score than her partner's score. In turn, the subject's
      knowledge of healthy pregnancy habits as manifested in the assessment score had
      only a weak relationship with prenatal alcohol consumption. Previous alcohol use 
      by the pregnant woman was the strongest predictor of prenatal alcohol use.
      CONCLUSIONS: Because previous alcohol consumption use by the pregnant woman was
      the strongest predictor of prenatal alcohol use, the importance of its accurate
      identification is emphasized. Although pending further investigation, knowledge
      about healthy pregnancy behaviors may exert greater impact if it is shared by a
      pregnant woman and her partner.

TI  - Association of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and gestational alcohol
      exposure: an exploratory study.
PG  - 515-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To explore association between prevalence of ADHD and
      levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure, the authors reviewed the charts 
      of 2,231 youth referred for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Participants were
      categorized into four groups by different levels of risk for gestational alcohol 
      exposure. For each group, the prevalence rates of ADHD and other selected
      disorders were determined. RESULTS: The disorder ranking first in overall
      prevalence was ADHD (41%), followed by learning disorder (17%) and
      oppositional-defiant/conduct disorder (16%). Prevalence rates of ADHD across the 
      groups generally were high risk > some risk > unknown risk > no risk. CONCLUSION:
      The frequency distribution of ADHD cases was according to the levels of risk for 
      gestational alcohol exposure. These results add to a growing body of evidence
      supporting an association between ADHD and prenatal alcohol exposure. Findings
      need to be confirmed by definitive studies on ADHD and gestational alcohol
      exposure.

TI  - Prospective identification of pregnant women drinking four or more standard
      drinks (> or = 48 g) of alcohol per day.
PG  - 183-97
AB  - We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of
      pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more
      alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying
      self-reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health
      professionals at the Maipu Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood
      of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic
      between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined
      criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We
      interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial
      interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption,
      and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per
      day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on
      average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit
      questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 
      women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who
      were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day 
      drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p =
      0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age
      (p = 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or
      appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or
      having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In
      conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during
      pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile,
      clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus
      (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help
      screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in Finland: clinical delineation of 77 older
      children and adolescents.
PG  - 137-43
AB  - The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human comprise a spectrum of
      structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most
      accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We previously have
      proposed revisions to the 1996 Institute of Medicine Diagnostic Criteria for
      diagnoses in the FASD continuum [fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal
      alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol
      related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)], allowing for more reproducible and
      accurate FASD diagnosis in a clinical setting [Hoyme et al., 2005]. The NIAAA
      recently has coordinated and funded an international consortium of projects aimed
      at more complete characterization of the teratogenic spectrum of alcohol. One of 
      the projects sites is in Finland. The aims of this project are: (1) to completely
      clinically characterize the structural and learning/behavioral phenotypes of a
      large cohort of older children and adolescents with moderate to severe disability
      within the FASD continuum; (2) to correlate FASD dysmorphology and behavioral
      phenotypes with CNS structure and function (i.e., MRS, MRI correlations); (3) to 
      compare the phenotype of a genetically homogeneous population of Finnish children
      with FASD to that observed in other populations. We have recently completed
      dysmorphology examination and parent/guardian interviews of the 77 children in
      the Finnish cohort. The purpose of this report is to present historical and
      morphometric data on these patients, thereby more completely delineating the
      clinical spectrum of FASD in older children and adolescents, contrasting the
      phenotype with that described in other populations and examining whether a
      weighted dysmorphology score could be used as a clinical and research adjunct
      when fetal alcohol exposure is being suspected. All children were previously
      diagnosed with FASD by an experienced pediatric specialist in Finland, and all
      were exposed to significant maternal alcohol abuse prenatally. The sex ratio of
      the cohort was 0.38 (male: female) and ages ranged from 8 to 20 years, with a
      mean of 13 years. After application of the Revised IOM Diagnostic Criteria, 53%
      of the subjects were diagnosed as having FAS, 30% PFAS, 12% ARND, and 5% other
      diagnoses. Of note, although a family history of mental retardation or birth
      defects was rare, 43% of the children had one or more sibling who also carried a 
      diagnosis of FAS. Eighty-nine percent of the mothers smoked cigarettes during
      gestation; other teratogenic exposures were rare. Almost none had undergone
      genetics evaluation in the past. Almost all of the subjects had resided in
      multiple foster placements since early childhood and had been followed regularly 
      by pediatric specialists. Although 11% were born prematurely, 70% demonstrated
      prenatal growth deficiency, and 45% were microcephalic. Other than growth
      deficits and the cardinal facial features, the most common major and minor
      anomalies noted were: camptodactyly (55%), "hockey stick" or other altered palmar
      creases (51%), refractive errors (40%), strabismus (38%), dental crowding (43%), 
      nail hypoplasia (38%), GU anomalies (22%), and congenital heart defects (18%),
      "Railroad track" ears were not observed in this population.

TI  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
PG  - 101-34
AB  - Alcohol is a potent teratogen in humans, and prenatal alcohol exposure is a
      leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The
      term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) refers to a pattern of birth defects found in
      children of mothers who drank during pregnancy. FAS has four criteria: maternal
      drinking during pregnancy, a characteristic pattern of facial abnormalities,
      growth retardation, and brain damage (often manifested by intellectual
      difficulties or behavioral problems). As surveillance and research have
      progressed, it has become clear that FAS is but a rare example of a wide array of
      defects that can occur from exposure to alcohol in utero. At least 1 in 10 women 
      will continue to consume alcohol during pregnancy, putting their fetuses at risk 
      for the effects of alcohol exposure. Nurses are in a key position to provide care
      and conduct research that will contribute to the prevention of the adverse
      effects of prenatal alcohol exposure during the preconception and perinatal
      periods, as well as deal with the negative outcomes of exposure in the developing
      infant. Many areas have yet to be evaluated. Screening tools and interventions
      have been developed and tested, mostly in majority cultures. Culturally sensitive
      instruments must be generated and validated for high-risk groups such as Native
      Americans. Fetal alcohol biomarkers and genetic research are new and need
      considerably more work. Effective "no drinking during pregnancy" campaigns for
      high-risk groups must be created and tested. Nurses are well placed to conduct
      research that will describe the effects at social, behavioral, and biological
      levels; develop middle-range theories targeted at preventing the drinking
      behavior and optimizing care of affected children after birth; and generate and
      test effective interventions that enhance prevention strategies in the 21st
      century.

      and syndromes associated with alcohol abuse.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - Alcohol abuse is common among the population and results in significant diseases 
      that shorten life span. Ethanol may result in chronic brain changes such as
      atrophy but may also result in neurologic disease that may be acute or chronic
      and sometimes life threatening. Accompanying vitamin deficiencies may lead to
      Wernicke's encephalopathy and changes in serum osmosis may lead to several acute 
      demyelinating disorders. In addition, pregnant women who consume alcohol place
      their babies at high risk for the fetal alcohol syndrome. In this article we
      review these disorders and emphasize their imaging features.

TI  - Alcohol consumption among low-income pregnant Latinas.
PG  - 2022-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to changing cultural norms, Latinas of childbearing age residing 
      in the U.S. may be at increasing risk of drinking harmful levels of alcohol
      during pregnancy, and may also be unaware of the risks for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorders associated with this behavior. We assessed the prevalence of alcohol
      consumption in a sample of low-income pregnant Latinas and examined risk factors 
      for alcohol use in the periconceptional period. METHODS: As part of a larger
      intervention trial, a cross-sectional in-home interview study was conducted among
      a sample of 100 pregnant low-income Latinas receiving services from the Special
      Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in San
      Diego County, California. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of respondents indicated
      they were either life-time abstainers or had not consumed any alcohol in the
      periconceptional period. Forty-three percent reported some alcohol use in the
      three months prior to recognition of the current pregnancy, and 20% reported at
      least one binge episode of four or more standard drinks during that time frame.
      Five percent reported drinking seven or more drinks per week, and 8% continued
      drinking alcohol after recognition of pregnancy. Significant predictors of any
      alcohol use in the periconceptional period included English language/higher level
      of acculturation, younger maternal age, lower parity, higher level of education, 
      younger age at first drink, and having ever smoked. Women who were aware of
      alcohol warning messages and /or had more knowledge of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
      (FAS) were significantly more likely to have consumed alcohol in the
      periconceptional period. Frequency of periconceptional use of alcohol did not
      differ between women who planned or did not plan the pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The
      prevalence and pattern of early pregnancy alcohol consumption in this sample of
      Latinas is similar to patterns noted in other race/ethnic groups in the U.S.
      Level of knowledge about FAS and awareness of warning messages was not protective
      for early pregnancy alcohol consumption, suggesting that specific knowledge was
      insufficient to prevent exposure or that other factors reinforce maintenance of
      alcohol consumption in early pregnancy. Selective interventions in low-income
      Latinas are warranted, and should be focused on women of reproductive age who are
      binge or frequent drinkers and who are at risk of becoming pregnant.

AB  - Alcohol abuse in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranging from
      discreet developmental problems to fetal alcohol syndrome. That is why pregnant
      women and the women considering pregnancy should abstain from alcohol. Fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders occur even after drinking at early stages of pregnancy
      when women are not aware of being pregnant. According to one study 75% Czech
      women drank alcohol before pregnancy and one third of them continued during first
      three months of pregnancy. According to new epidemiological data 83.4% of Czech
      women aged between 18 and 40 drank alcohol during the year preceeding the
      pregnancy. The prevention in this area in the Czech Republic is clearly not
      satisfactory, and it is complicated by the alcohol advertising targeted at women,
      low taxation of alcohol and other factors.

      prospective series of 150 women].
PG  - 687-93
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of the prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure in relation
      with declared alcohol consumption (DAC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational
      prospective study based on the DAC of 150 women in post-partum or hospitalized
      for abnormal pregnancies. The main selection criterion was change in DAC before
      and during pregnancy, classified according to alcohol use and misuse limits.
      Excessive alcohol intake was defined as more than 4 glasses on occasion and/or
      more than 14 glasses a week. Age and professional position were also taken into
      account. Data were obtained using semi-directive interviews. RESULTS: 79% of
      these women drank before pregnancy. 33.2% of them had excessive intake.
      Consumption of more than 14 glasses a week concerned 10% of the population.
      Excessive consumptions on occasion significantly affected 33% of the population. 
      During pregnancy, 43% of these women continued drinking. Overall excessive
      intake, which is noxious for children, concerned 9.9% of the women. 5% declared a
      regular misuse above 14 glasses a week and 7% of them consumed more than 4
      glasses on occasion. The average age was 29.8 years. Most of the women (61%) had 
      a stable job. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms alcohol consumption by women, even
      during pregnancy. Consumptions of pregnant women is decreasing progressively. DAC
      is very useful to evaluate alcohol intake.

PG  - 1059-64
AB  - Alcohol use among women of childbearing age is prevalent in the United States,
      with approximately 1 in 5 nonpregnant women reporting binge drinking (5 or more
      drinks on any one occasion) and 1 in 25 pregnant women reporting binge drinking. 
      Alcohol use during pregnancy results in a spectrum of adverse outcomes known as
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of these
      disorders. Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by specific facial
      abnormalities and significant impairments in neurodevelopment and physical
      growth. Early identification of children with FAS has been shown to enhance their
      long-term outcomes. In an effort to improve clinical recognition of children with
      this condition, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was directed by 
      Congress in 2002 to lead the development of uniform diagnostic criteria for FAS
      and other prenatal alcohol-related conditions. The purpose of this commentary is 
      to provide clinicians a summary of the report released by CDC describing the
      current diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, advancements have been made in 
      screening and brief interventions for alcohol use disorders in women who have the
      potential to make significant strides in the prevention of FAS spectrum
      disorders. Knowledge of the diagnostic criteria for FAS can lead to increased
      identification of the syndrome in infants and children and the provision of
      appropriate medical and support services. Screening for and intervening with
      women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy can prevent FAS and other fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders.

TI  - Alcohol consumption and serum hormone levels during pregnancy.
PG  - 47-53
AB  - Factors that change sex hormone levels during pregnancy may have long-term health
      consequences for the offspring, including changes in breast cancer risk. A
      cross-sectional analysis of alcohol consumption and hormone levels in 339
      pregnant women sampled from the Child Health and Development Study cohort was
      undertaken. Alcohol intake was queried from 1959 to 1966, long before any hazards
      of drinking during pregnancy were publicized. Third trimester serum hormone
      levels including estradiol and testosterone were analyzed. Among 339 pregnant
      women, 196 reported some alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The drinkers were 
      divided into three groups with intake levels of 0.2-0.5, 0.6-2.0, and 2.1-12.5
      ounces of ethanol per week. The second group corresponds to a median intake of
      approximately 2 drinks per week, and the last group corresponds to a median
      intake of approximately 1 drink per day, which is considered "light" to
      "moderate" drinking. Maternal estradiol levels were not associated with alcohol
      intake during pregnancy. However, serum testosterone was significantly lower, by 
      12.2%, in the latter two groups of drinking pregnant women, [confidence interval 
      (CI)=-3.0 to 25.2] and 25.6% (CI=9.2-39.5), respectively. The alcohol intakes
      reported are far below those shown to cause fetal alcohol syndrome, or any of the
      fetal alcohol effects so far studied. Light alcohol intake during pregnancy is
      associated with lower maternal testosterone. The health implications are
      uncertain, but may include an increased breast density in the daughters of
      drinking mothers.

TI  - Guidelines for identifying and referring persons with fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) results from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy
      and carries lifelong consequences. Early recognition of FAS can result in better 
      outcomes for persons who receive a diagnosis. Although FAS was first identified
      in 1973, persons with this condition often do not receive a diagnosis. In 2002,
      Congress directed CDC to update and refine diagnostic and referral criteria for
      FAS, incorporating recent scientific and clinical evidence. In 2002, CDC convened
      a scientific working group (SWG) of persons with expertise in FAS research,
      diagnosis, and treatment to draft criteria for diagnosing FAS. This report
      summarizes the diagnostic guidelines drafted by the SWG, provides recommendations
      for when and how to refer a person suspected of having problems related to
      prenatal alcohol exposure, and assesses existing practices for creating
      supportive environments that might prevent long-term adverse consequences
      associated with FAS. The guidelines were created on the basis of a review of
      scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and the experiences of families affected
      by FAS regarding the physical and neuropsychologic features of FAS and the
      medical, educational, and social services needed by persons with FAS and their
      families. The guidelines are intended to facilitate early identification of
      persons affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol so they and their families can
      receive services that enable them to achieve healthy lives and reach their full
      potential. This report also includes recommendations to enhance identification of
      and intervention for women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Additional
      data are needed to develop diagnostic criteria for other related disorders (e.g.,
      alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder).

TI  - Moral maturity and delinquency after prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 545-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with cognitive, behavioral 
      and social deficits, including delinquency. Although delinquent populations and
      those with intellectual and behavioral deficits exhibit impaired moral judgment
      and reasoning, this area remains unexplored in alcohol-exposed individuals.
      METHOD: Moral maturity and delinquency were evaluated in 27 participants with
      prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC group) and 29 nonexposed controls (CON group)
      matched on age (range: 10-18), gender, handedness, socioeconomic status and
      ethnicity. Moral maturity was evaluated using the Sociomoral Reflection
      Measure-Short Form, and delinquency was evaluated with the Conduct Disorder (CD) 
      Questionnaire. Additional measures included social desirability and inhibition.
      RESULTS: The ALC group performed at a lower level of moral maturity than the CON 
      group. Whereas Verbal IQ primarily predicted this difference, a deficit on the
      moral value judgment having to do with relationships with others was specific to 
      prenatal alcohol exposure. Furthermore, delinquency was higher in the ALC group, 
      and specific sociomoral values were predictive of delinquent behavior. Finally,
      half of the children and adolescents with a history of prenatal alcohol exposure 
      but without fetal alcohol syndrome had probable CD. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
      this study indicate that interventions aimed at reducing delinquency in those
      with prenatal alcohol exposure are necessary, and targeting moral judgment for
      this purpose may be beneficial.

PG  - 1199-201
AB  - QUESTION: By the time women find out they are pregnant and see a family
      physician, they might have already consumed alcohol during the pregnancy and
      affected the development of their fetuses. How can family physicians better
      prevent exposure to alcohol during pregnancy? ANSWER: Women of childbearing age
      should be counseled about the risks associated with alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy before they become pregnant. Diagnosing children who have fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders can help identify birth mothers who are at risk of other
      alcohol-exposed pregnancies and who need support to change their behaviour.

TI  - Reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk in college women: initial outcomes of a
      clinical trial of a motivational intervention.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - A significant number of college women are at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy
      (AEP) owing to binge drinking paired with using contraception ineffectively. This
      article describes a randomized controlled trial of a one-session motivational
      interviewing-based intervention to reduce AEP risk among college women and
      presents 1-month outcomes demonstrating the early impact of this intervention.
      There were 228 female students from a mid-Atlantic urban university enrolled in
      the trial. Eligibility criteria were being in the age range of 18-24 years and
      being at risk for AEP. Risk for AEP was defined as having sexual intercourse with
      a man in the past 90 days while using contraception ineffectively (no use,
      incorrect use of an effective method, or use of an ineffective method only);
      drinking at risky levels was defined as engaging in at least one binge in the
      past 90 days or consuming an average of eight standard drinks per week. One-month
      outcome data were available for 212 of the 228 enrolled women (a follow-up rate
      of 93%), with complete data available for 105 women assigned to the control
      condition and 94 assigned to the intervention condition. At 1-month follow-up,
      15% of the control subjects and 25% of the intervention women reported no risk
      drinking, a significant difference favoring the intervention group. Significantly
      fewer control subjects (48%) used effective contraception at 1-month follow-up as
      compared with intervention women (64%), chi(2)(1) = 5.1, p < .03. Significantly
      more intervention women (74%) were no longer at risk for AEP at 1 month as
      compared with control subjects (54%), chi(2)(1) = 8.15, p < .005. Factors that
      were associated with continued AEP risk at 1-month follow-up were a higher number
      of standard drinks per day consumed in the month prior to baseline (odds ratio,
      1.1) and assignment to the control condition (odds ratio, 2.9). The risks of
      unintended pregnancy and AEP among drinking women in college merit greater
      prevention efforts. The results of this study show the promise of one preventive 
      intervention that warrants additional study.

TI  - Relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to cognitive processing speed and
      efficiency in childhood.
PG  - 1473-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to deficits in processing
      speed in both infancy and later in childhood. This study was designed to examine 
      prenatal alcohol-related deficits in both processing speed and processing
      efficiency in four domains of cognitive function. METHODS: Black children (n=337;
      age, 7.5 years), prospectively recruited to over-represent prenatal alcohol
      exposure at moderate-to-heavy levels, were assessed on four processing speed
      tasks, using a Sternberg paradigm. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to
      contrast overall processing speed, indicated by reaction time (RT) differences at
      the intercept, with processing efficiency, indicated by the slope of RT changes
      across increasing levels of task difficulty. Performance on these tasks within an
      effortful cognitive framework was compared with RT on a task involving relatively
      more automatic processing. Path analysis was used to examine the degree to which 
      the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on working memory was mediated by slower 
      RT. RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with slower processing
      speed on several of the Sternberg tasks, and the number comparison task showed a 
      specific deficit in processing efficiency. These effects on tasks involving
      effortful processing contrasted with the lack of performance differences on the
      more automatic RT measure. The relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to working
      memory was mediated, in part, by an associated reduction in processing speed.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm reports by other investigators linking prenatal
      alcohol exposure to slower processing speed and show that this RT deficit is
      found within the context of complex cognition but not where automatic processing 
      is involved. The reduction in RT accounts, in part, for the previously reported
      alcohol-related effects on working memory. The number comparison slope was the
      only specific component of information processing affected, confirming previous
      reports of a distinctive prenatal alcohol effect on number processing.

TI  - Evaluation of corpus callosum anisotropy in young adults with fetal alcohol
      syndrome according to diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - 1214-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and associated disorders resulting from 
      maternal alcohol use during gestation are among the most common developmental
      disorders. However, they are rarely diagnosed and not fully understood in terms
      of their behavioral and neurocognitive phenotype. Prenatal exposure leads to
      alterations in facial morphology, growth, and neurocognition. The nature and
      extent of teratogenic effects on the brain and the relationship between such
      effects and observed behaviors remain in debate because there are no established 
      markers for the neurological effects of exposure. In this study, we examined the 
      impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on white-matter integrity in the corpus
      callosum by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and herein describe the
      relationship between such effects and observed physical and behavioral outcomes. 
      METHODS: DTI was used to evaluate diffusion anisotropy in the genu and splenium
      of corpus callosum in 16 low-income, primarily African-American volunteers.
      Volunteers were recruited from a cohort of young adults who had received
      neuropsychological evaluations during adolescence. Nine had been prenatally
      exposed to alcohol and had characteristics of FAS, and seven were nonexposed
      controls. RESULTS: Significant difference in the means for diffusion fractional
      anisotropy (t = 2.26, df = 9, p <0.002) and apparent diffusion coefficient (t =
      2.14, df = 14, p < 0.008) were observed in the corpus callosum of alcohol-exposed
      youth compared with nonexposed youth. No significant differences were found in
      intracranial volume between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate
      that DTI can be used in evaluating the integrity of corpus callosum in
      alcohol-exposed individuals. If future studies support these findings, diffusion 
      anisotropy, represented by fractional anisotropy, has the potential to be used as
      a clinical marker in the diagnosis of FAS.

TI  - [Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among Japanese children of alcoholic
      mothers].
PG  - 219-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to examine fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
      (FASD) among Japanese children of alcoholic mothers. This is the first report
      concerning FASD in Japan. METHODS: The subjects were 30 alcoholic women who were 
      inpatients in the Kurihama Alcoholism Center and had given birth to children.
      They were subjected to a semi-structured interview by the author. Sixty healthy
      women who had not drunk during pregnancy were used as a control group, and they
      also underwent semi-structured interviews. The alcoholic women were divided into 
      two groups, 13 who drunk during pregnancies and 17 who did not drink. Twenty
      children experienced of prenatal alcohol exposure and 40 children did not. The
      three groups; i.e., 13 alcoholic mothers who had drunk during pregnancy and their
      20 children (ALD group), 17 alcoholic mothers who had not drunk during pregnancy 
      and their 40 children (ALND group) and 60 non-alcoholic control mothers and their
      80 children (Control group), were compared concerning the mothers' drinking
      problems and abnormal deliveries, children's birth weights, congenital
      abnormalities, abnormalities of the central nervous system and psychological
      problems. RESULTS: The mean age of onset of problem drinking of the mothers in
      the ALD group was significantly lower than that in the mothers of the ALND group,
      and some of the mothers in the ALD group showed alcohol dependence before their
      pregnancies. The mean birth weights of the children of the ALD group, ALND group 
      and Control group were 2816 g, 3128 g and 3142 g, respectively and the
      differences were significant. The children of the ALD group had significantly
      more abnormal birth episodes, developmental retardation and psychiatric symptoms 
      than those in the other two groups. Among 20 children in the ALD group, FASD was 
      suspected in 6 children (10% of the children of alcoholic mothers). Six children 
      had low birth weights, abnormal birth episodes, mental retardation and
      psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: One third of the Japanese children of alcoholic
      mothers had experiences of prenatal alcohol exposure and 10% of them had
      suspected FASD abnormalities.

TI  - Maternal risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome in the Western cape province of 
      South Africa: a population-based study.
PG  - 1190-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We defined risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a region 
      with the highest documented prevalence of FAS in the world. METHODS: We compared 
      mothers of 53 first-grade students with FAS (cases) with 116 randomly selected
      mothers of first-grade students without FAS (controls). RESULTS: Differences
      between case and control mothers in our study population existed regarding
      socioeconomic status, religiosity, education, gravidity, parity, and marital
      status. Mothers of children with FAS came from alcohol-abusing families in which 
      heavy drinking was almost universal; control mothers drank little to no alcohol. 
      Current and past alcohol use by case mothers was characterized by heavy binge
      drinking on weekends, with no reduction of use during pregnancy in 87% of the
      mothers. Twenty percent of control mothers drank during pregnancy, a rate that
      declined to 12.7% by the third trimester. The percentage who smoked during
      pregnancy was higher for case mothers than for control mothers (75.5% vs 30.3%), 
      but the number of cigarettes smoked was low among case mothers. The incidence of 
      FAS in offspring of relatively young women (28 years) was not explained by early 
      drinking onset or years of drinking (mean, 7.6 years among case mothers). In
      addition to traditional FAS risk factors, case mothers were smaller in height,
      weight, head circumference, and body mass index, all anthropomorphic measures
      that indicate poor nutrition and second-generation fetal alcohol exposure.
      CONCLUSIONS: Preventive interventions are needed to address maternal risk factors
      for FAS.

TI  - [A case of fetal alcohol effects with orofacial cleft].
PG  - 137-43
AB  - Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy may result in facial dysmorphism, growth
      retardation and central nervous system deficits. This has been found in infants
      ranging from fetal alcohol effects (FAE) to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), or
      alcohol related neurodevelopment disorders (ARND) and alcohol related birth
      defects (ARBD). In this study, we report a FAE case with orofacial cleft due to
      mother's alcohol use during her pregnancy. A 32-year-old Japanese woman, para2,
      gravida3. She was drinking alcohol while this pregnancy. At 39th week, a girl was
      delivered vaginally. Her birth weight is 3860gr. Apgar score is seven points at
      one minutes and eight points at 10 minutes. Orofacial cleft and sinus tachycardia
      were diagnosed postnatally. From a brain-computed tomography (CTscan), it showed 
      a normal finding. Karyotype was normal female phenotype (46, XX). It is important
      to note that the obstetrician had to advise the women not to have alcohol use
      during pregnancy in order to prevent her baby from fetal alcohol effects or toxic
      effect of alcohol on the fetus.

TI  - Impaired cerebellar learning in children with prenatal alcohol exposure: a
      comparative study of eyeblink conditioning in children with ADHD and dyslexia.
PG  - 389-98
AB  - Neuroanatomical and behavioral evidence indicate that the cerebellum is
      particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Recent
      research has shown impairments in eyeblink conditioning in rats following
      binge-like neonatal ethanol exposure. The neural substrates of eyeblink
      conditioning have been localized to the cerebellum and related brainstem
      mechanisms. The present study considered whether heavy prenatal alcohol exposure 
      would result in similar impairments in eyeblink conditioning in children. A
      related purpose was to determine if eyeblink conditioning could discriminate
      between children with prenatal alcohol exposure and children diagnosed with
      attention deficit hyperactive disorder or developmental dyslexia. Fifty-three
      age-matched children [10 prenatal alcohol exposure (FAE), 16 attention deficit
      hyperactive disordered (ADHD), 14 children with dyslexia (DYS), 13 normal
      controls] were assessed on eyeblink conditioning in the delay paradigm. Children 
      in the FAE and DYS groups failed to learn the conditioned response, producing
      longer latencies and poorly timed responses to the conditioning stimulus.
      Children with ADHD were impaired on measures of adaptively timed responses,
      although conditioned responses matched normal controls. The results suggest that 
      children prenatally exposed to alcohol have deficits in cerebellar processing
      similar to those with dyslexia, and that these functional deficits are related to
      disabilities in learning.

TI  - Brief intervention for prenatal alcohol use: a randomized trial.
PG  - 991-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of a brief intervention in the reduction of 
      prenatal alcohol consumption by women when a partner is included. METHODS:
      Randomized trial of a single session brief intervention given by the study nurse 
      or principal investigator for 304 pregnant women and their partners. The women
      had positive T-ACE (Tolerance, Annoyed, Cut down, Eye-opener, an alcohol
      screening test) results and were at risk for alcohol consumption while pregnant. 
      All completed initial diagnostic and postpartum interviews. RESULTS: Fewer than
      20% of participants (median 11.5 weeks of gestation) were abstinent at study
      enrollment, averaging more than 1.5 drinks per episode. Nearly 30% had 2 or more 
      drinks at a time while pregnant. Prenatal alcohol use declined in both the
      treatment and control groups after study enrollment, based on a 95% follow-up
      rate. Factors associated with increased prenatal alcohol use after randomization 
      included more years of education, extent of previous alcohol consumption, and
      temptation to drink in social situations. Brief interventions for prenatal
      alcohol reduced subsequent consumption most significantly for the women with the 
      highest consumption initially (regression coefficient, b = -0.163, standard error
      (b) = 0.063, P < .01). Moreover, the effects of the brief intervention were
      significantly enhanced when a partner participated (b = -0.932, standard error
      (b) = 0.468), P < .05). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with the highest levels of
      alcohol use reduced their drinking most after a brief intervention that included 
      their partners. Recommendations include consistent screening for prenatal alcohol
      use followed by diagnostic assessment when indicated, and if confirmed by other
      studies, a patient-partner brief intervention for the heaviest drinkers.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders prevention: an exploratory study of women's use 
      of, attitudes toward, and knowledge about alcohol.
PG  - 187-93
AB  - PURPOSE: The incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is increasing, 
      even though it is 100% preventable. This study examined use of, knowledge about, 
      and attitudes toward alcohol of women requesting emergency contraception (EC)
      and/or a pregnancy test, and evaluated whether a brief intervention would be
      effective in educating them about the risks of FASD. DATA SOURCES: Fifty women
      from two outpatient clinics participated. Information was collected on
      demographic and personal health habits, alcohol use, and knowledge of and
      attitudes toward alcohol. As a brief intervention to increase knowledge about
      FASD, participants read a short pamphlet about the risks of alcohol exposure in
      pregnancy and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Descriptive statistics,
      including means, standard deviations, and skewness, were calculated for all
      variables. Pearson correlations were computed to assess relationships between
      demographic/lifestyle variables and attitudes toward and knowledge about alcohol.
      Paired t-tests were used to analyze the relationship between pretest and
      post-test knowledge scores. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants were single
      (76%), college educated (94%), and received EC at the clinic visit (60%). The
      average age was 24 years. Slightly over half (52%) reported drinking beer at
      least once a week, with one to six cans on occasion. Younger women expressed more
      tolerant attitudes toward alcohol use (p= .02) and drank significantly more beer 
      on occasion (p= .015). Women who reported drinking alcohol when they last had sex
      were significantly (p= .017) less tolerant in their attitudes toward alcohol use.
      The intervention used in this study was effective in communicating knowledge
      about FASD to this population (p < .0001). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These
      findings suggest that young women may be engaging in behaviors that could put
      potential offspring at risk for exposure to alcohol. Clinicians are advised to
      take a thorough history to determine alcohol use in all women of childbearing age
      and to provide information regarding FASD prevention.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and ability, academic achievement, and school
      functioning in adolescence: a longitudinal follow-up.
PG  - 116-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with learning, behavioral,
      and academic problems even in children without the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the prenatal alcohol exposure and ability, academic
      achievement, and school functioning in adolescence. METHODS: In a longitudinal
      cohort, intelligence, academic performance, and school functioning were evaluated
      in 265 low socioeconomic status (SES) adolescents (M age = 15.1 years), 128
      prenatally exposed to alcohol, 53 controls, and 84 special education students by 
      using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd edition (WISC-III) and
      the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT). School records were abstracted
      for grade point averages (GPA), standardized achievement test scores, conduct,
      attendance, and special education placement. RESULTS: Alcohol-affected youth had 
      significantly lower IQs than those in the other three groups. CONCLUSION:
      Although academic achievement (WIAT scores) was most impaired in the special
      education group who showed lower performance over all as well as in reading and
      spelling, alcohol-affected youth showed significant deficits on mathematics
      subtests. There was no increased incidence of conduct problems in school records 
      related to alcohol exposure.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Canadian guidelines for diagnosis.
PG  - S1-S21
AB  - The diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is complex and guidelines
      are warranted. A subcommittee of the Public Health Agency of Canada's National
      Advisory Committee on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder reviewed, analysed and
      integrated current approaches to diagnosis to reach agreement on a standard in
      Canada. The purpose of this paper is to review and clarify the use of current
      diagnostic systems and make recommendations on their application for diagnosis of
      FASD-related disabilities in people of all ages. The guidelines are based on
      widespread consultation of expert practitioners and partners in the field. The
      guidelines have been organized into 7 categories: screening and referral; the
      physical examination and differential diagnosis; the neurobehavioural assessment;
      and treatment and follow-up; maternal alcohol history in pregnancy; diagnostic
      criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS and alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorder; and harmonization of Institute of Medicine and
      4-Digit Diagnostic Code approaches. The diagnosis requires a comprehensive
      history and physical and neurobehavioural assessments; a multidisciplinary
      approach is necessary. These are the first Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis 
      of FAS and its related disabilities, developed by broad-based consultation among 
      experts in diagnosis.

TI  - QT prolongation in the newborn and maternal alcoholism.
PG  - 565-6
AB  - I discuss a newborn whose mother is addicted to alcohol. On the third day of
      life, the newborn was found to have ventricular tachycardia. After spontaneous
      termination of the abnormal rhythm, the duration of the corrected QT interval was
      0.48 s. During the next days, the duration of the interval normalized, and has
      now remained stable for 5 years. I conclude that the so-called "alcohol
      withdrawal syndrome of the newborn" might cause postnatal prolongation of the QT 
      interval.

TI  - Alcohol consumption among women who are pregnant or who might become
      pregnant--United States, 2002.
PG  - 1178-81
AB  - Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with health problems that adversely
      affect the mother and fetus; no level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy has
      been determined safe. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is recognized as the foremost 
      preventable condition involving neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities. 
      Women who drink during pregnancy place themselves at risk for having a child with
      FAS or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To determine the alcohol
      consumption patterns among all women of childbearing age, including those who are
      pregnant or might become pregnant, CDC analyzed data for women aged 18-44 years
      from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. The
      results of that analysis indicated that approximately 10% of pregnant women used 
      alcohol, and approximately 2% engaged in binge drinking or frequent use of
      alcohol. The results further indicated that more than half of women who did not
      use birth control (and therefore might become pregnant) reported alcohol use and 
      12.4% reported binge drinking. Women who are pregnant or who might become
      pregnant should abstain from alcohol use.

TI  - Maternal age, alcohol abuse history, and quality of parenting as moderators of
      the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on 7.5-year intellectual function.
PG  - 1732-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: In contrast to the extensive literature documenting IQ deficits in
      patients with fetal alcohol syndrome, effects on IQ have not generally been
      reported for children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND).
      This study examined the role of maternal age, MAST, and quality of parenting in
      moderating the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the WISC-III IQ test in
      moderate-to-heavily exposed children. METHODS: A total of 337 inner-city African 
      American children whose mothers were recruited prenatally were administered the
      WISC-III at 7.5 years. Alcohol exposure was assesed with a timeline follow-back
      interview administered at every prenatal clinic visit. Moderating effects of the 
      three risk factors were examined by adding interaction terms to regression
      analyses and dichotomizing the moderators and performing separate regressions on 
      the two groups. RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol exposure was related to WISC-III
      Freedom from Distractibility but not to Full Scale IQ for the sample as a whole. 
      However, among children born to older mothers, an alcohol effect emerged on Full 
      Scale IQ and five of seven composite IQ scores. Similarly, adverse effects were
      seen among children of MAST-positive mothers and children whose parents provided 
      less optimal cognitive stimulation. Each additional ounce of absolute alcohol
      consumed per day during pregnancy was associated with a 2.9-point decrease in
      Full Scale IQ and a 5.6-point decrement on Freedom from Distractibility.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate IQ effects among children
      with ARND born to older and MAST-positive mothers, particularly in relation to
      first-trimester drinking. These findings suggest that there are subgroups of more
      vulnerable and severely affected children whose intellectual performance is
      compromised. A moderate- to heavy-drinking mother who has given birth to an
      unaffected child when she was younger needs to be warned that her risk of having 
      an adversely affected child increases as she grows older.

TI  - Clinical practice characteristics and preconception counseling strategies of
      health care providers who recommend alcohol abstinence during pregnancy.
PG  - 1724-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: National initiatives on fetal alcohol syndrome in Canada and the
      United States aimed at prevention, identification, and treatment of individuals
      who are affected by alcohol exposure in utero recommend that women abstain from
      consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Health care providers are key educators
      regarding appropriate alcohol use. The objective of this study was to describe
      characteristics of physicians who recommend alcohol abstinence during pregnancy
      with regard to knowledge of fetal alcohol syndrome and preconception counseling
      strategies. METHODS: A survey was mailed to Canadian physicians and midwives
      between 2001 and 2002. Participants consisted of a national random sample of 1090
      Canadian obstetricians and gynecologists, midwives, and family physicians who
      were current members of provincial and national professional organizations. The
      main outcome measure was questionnaire responses to knowledge, prevention, and
      diagnosis of issues related to alcohol use during pregnancy. RESULTS: Response
      rates ranged from 31.1% among family physicians to 63.5% among midwives. Overall,
      91.2% of providers recommended abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. These
      providers were significantly more likely to believe that there is sufficient
      information about alcohol use and that clients were interested in discussing
      alcohol (p < 0.05). They were also significantly more likely to discuss
      depression, personal alcohol use, partner's use of alcohol, and family history of
      alcohol misuse with women of childbearing age (p < 0.05). Once a patient became
      pregnant, fewer practice differences were noted, although those who recommended
      alcohol abstinence were significantly more likely to take clinical action when
      pregnant patients were consuming moderate amounts of alcohol (p < 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: It is encouraging that almost 90% of Canadian health care providers 
      recommend abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. However, differences in
      clinical practice exist between providers who recommend alcohol abstinence during
      pregnancy as compared with those who recommend a "glass in moderation."

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome prevention in Washington State: evidence of success.
PG  - 344-51
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a permanent birth defect syndrome caused by
      maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. It is characterised by growth
      deficiency, central nervous system damage/dysfunction, and a unique cluster of
      minor facial anomalies. To assess the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome
      prevention efforts, one must be able to estimate accurately the prevalence of
      fetal alcohol syndrome over time in population-based samples. With the
      establishment of the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and
      Prevention Network of clinics, the development of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
      Facial Photographic Analysis Software, the creation of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorders (FASD) 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the establishment of the Foster Care
      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Screening Program, and the collection of Pregnancy Risk
      Assessment Management System data on maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy,
      the tools, methods and infrastructure for assessing the effectiveness of fetal
      alcohol syndrome primary prevention efforts in Washington State are in place. A
      cross-sectional study was conducted to determine whether the prevalence of fetal 
      alcohol syndrome among children in a foster care population, born between 1993
      and 1998, decreased with the documented decrease in prevalence of maternal use of
      alcohol during pregnancy from 1993 and 1998 in Washington State. The prevalence
      of maternal drinking during pregnancy in Washington State declined significantly 
      (P < 0.001) from 1993 to 1998 as did the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome
      among foster children born 1993-98 (P < 0.03). These observations support the
      likelihood that fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts in Washington State are
      working successfully.

TI  - Implicit strategy affects learning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol
      exposure.
PG  - 1424-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Learning and memory deficits are commonly reported in children with
      heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Our recent work suggested that children with
      heavy prenatal alcohol exposure retained information as well as controls on a
      verbal learning test but not on a test of nonverbal learning and memory. To
      better understand the cause of this differential pattern of performance, the
      current study re-analyzed data from our previous study to determine if the
      presence of an implicit learning strategy may account, at least in part, for the 
      finding of spared retention. METHODS: The current study examined verbal learning 
      and memory abilities in 35 children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) 
      and 34 nonexposed controls (CON) matched for age (9-16 years), sex, ethnicity,
      handedness, and socioeconomic status. Groups were compared on two measures of
      verbal learning, one with an implicit strategy (California Verbal Learning
      Test-Children's Version; CVLT-C) and one without (Verbal Learning subtest of the 
      Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning; VL-WRAML). RESULTS: Children with
      FASD learned less information overall than children in the CON group. Both groups
      learned a greater percentage of information and reached a learning plateau
      earlier on the CVLT-C compared with the VL-WRAML. Groups also showed comparable
      rates of retention after a delay on the CVLT-C. In contrast, on the VL-WRAML,
      children with FASD showed poorer retention rates than children in the CON group. 
      Interestingly, children with FASD did not differ from children in the CON group
      on CVLT-C semantic clustering scores for learning trials 1 through 3, and greater
      utilization of semantic clustering was correlated with better learning and memory
      performance in both groups. This overall pattern of results was not related to
      overall intellectual level. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of spared retention of
      verbal information on the CVLT-C in our earlier studies may be related to test
      characteristics of the CVLT-C rather than a finding of spared verbal retention
      per se, given that spared retention was not found on a separate test of verbal
      learning and memory without an implicit learning strategy. These results suggest 
      that the use of an implicit strategy positively affected the ability of
      alcohol-exposed children to learn and retain new verbal information.

TI  - A pilot study of alcohol exposure and pharmacokinetics in women with or without
      children with fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 503-8
AB  - AIMS: To determine the alcohol exposure and pharmacokinetics of alcohol in a
      group of women who had given birth to children with FAS, compared with women who 
      had not given birth to FAS children. METHODS: 10 women who had given birth to FAS
      children (FAS mothers) and 20 Controls were studied to determine how they
      metabolize alcohol in a single limited-access quasi-experimental session of
      voluntary consumption of alcohol. They had free choice in the consumption of any 
      amount of their favourite beverage for approximately 2.5 h, but their drinking
      was terminated if the breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) exceeded 150 mg%.
      BrACs was measured during ethanol consumption and for several hours after, for
      estimation of alcohol exposure and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: FAS mothers
      consumed significantly larger amounts of alcohol, and achieved significantly
      higher peak BrAC levels than Controls. The rate of decline of alcohol from the
      circulation (beta-60) showed a 2-fold variation across subjects but there was no 
      significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not
      show any difference in alcohol pharmacokinetics in free-choice drinking by
      non-pregnant women, who either have given or have never given birth to FAS
      children. However, mothers of FAS children tend to consume more alcohol per
      session. Future studies in larger samples will be needed to confirm these
      findings and to examine drinking patterns and other factors that may increase the
      risk of FAS in children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy.

TI  - A review of foetal alcohol syndrome and the role of the oral health care worker.
PG  - 158-61
AB  - Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) consists of multi-system abnormalities and is
      caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic
      effect of alcohol on humans has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and 
      FAS is one of the most important human teratogenic conditions known today. Many
      investigators have catalogued, quantified and refined these hallmarks of FAS over
      the years and have established that the most consistent consequences of heavy
      maternal drinking during pregnancy are prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, 
      and brain and craniofacial abnormalities. Many practitioners are unable to
      recognise the often subtle features associated with FAS and fail to diagnose it. 
      The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology, pathophysiology,
      clinical presentation and discuss the relevance of FAS to clinical dental
      practice.

      alcohol misuse are significantly different for women than for men. Understanding 
      these differences is imperative if effective preventative and treatment
      interventions are to be undertaken. This article reviews the epidemiology of
      alcohol misuse by women, effects of alcohol misuse on women, fetuses, and
      relationships, and assessment and treatment strategies. We then suggest
      directions for future research in this field.

AB  - Alcohol-related pathologies lead to most serious expressions, both at clinical
      and social level. The diffused social acceptance of consumption and abuse
      behavior and the lack of alcohol education for professionals (physicians,
      psychologists, social workers etc.) make difficult to put in the right frame this
      issue. Just a multidimensional approach can make the problem understandable. The 
      history of alcohol consumption during the time gives us an exhaustive picture of 
      the negative consequences of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy is a problem still underestimated and represents a serious risk for the
      health of the newborns: children alcohol-exposed in uterus are at risk to develop
      many pathologies and even the fetal-alcohol syndrome (FAS) that leads to facial
      anomalies, growth deficiencies and neurological damages. Therefore interventions 
      coping with this kind of issues are needed in order to enhance people's health.

TI  - Educating women about the hidden dangers of alcohol.
PG  - 24-31
AB  - 1. There is mounting research evidence that alcohol use and abuse affects women
      much differently than men. 2. Research indicates that women absorb and metabolize
      alcohol differently than men, partly due to body composition differences and the 
      production of less gastric alcohol dehydrogenase by women. 3. Women of
      child-bearing age who engage in binge drinking are at increased risk of bearing
      children with fetal alcohol syndrome or alcohol-related neurological deficits. 4.
      Psychiatric nurses are often in the position to provide education and counseling 
      to women regarding the hidden dangers of alcohol use and abuse.

TI  - Increased sibling mortality in children with fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 179-86; discussion 187-8
AB  - We compared the rate of all-cause mortality in siblings of children diagnosed
      with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) with the siblings of matched controls. The
      siblings of children with FAS had increased mortality (11.4%) compared with
      matched controls (2.0%), a 530% increase in mortality. The age of death in case
      siblings deaths occurred later (between 1 day and 7 years) compared with the
      controls (1 day to 4 years) [odds ratio (OR)=2.4 (0.4-15.6)]. Siblings of
      children with FAS had increased risk of death due to infectious illness [OR=13.7 
      (1.2-361)] and sudden infant death syndrome compared with controls [OR=10.2
      (1.2-75.1)]. A diagnosis of FAS is an important risk marker for mortality in the 
      siblings of the proband even if they do not have FAS. Maternal alcoholism appears
      to be a useful risk marker for increased mortality risk in diagnosed cases and
      their siblings. This has important implications in the management of family
      members of children with FAS.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome in the United States corrections system.
PG  - 169-76; discussion 177-8
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which may
      increase the risk of confinement in the corrections system. In the United States 
      each state and four major cities' corrections systems were asked to complete a
      questionnaire on the prevalence of FAS and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental
      disorder (ARND) in the offender population, the availability of screening and
      diagnostic services to identify offenders with FAS and staff training needs
      related to FAS. The total population in the 54 entities was 3,080,904 inmates.
      Completed questionnaires were obtained from 42 entities (78%). The mean rate of
      reported substance abuse in offenders was 60.1%. Specialized programs for persons
      with mental retardation were reported for 44.4% of corrections facilities and
      25.9% of community corrections facilities. Programs for pregnant women were
      reported for 46.3% of corrections facilities and 29.6% of community facilities.
      One program (1.9%) reported having a screening program for FAS in the corrections
      system. Only four programs (7.4%) reported having access to diagnostic services
      for FAS in the corrections facilities. Of the 3,080,904 offenders, only one
      offender was reported to have a diagnosis of FAS. Reported staff training needs
      were very large. In conclusion, corrections systems have high unmet needs to
      screen, identify, and treat offenders with FAS and ARND. Staff training needs are
      substantial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drinking of alcohol by pregnant women provokes many fetal development
      disorders, first of all the function of central nervous system and can lead to
      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome - FAS. AIM: Aims of investigation were to determine beta -
      hexosaminidase (HEX) and gamma - glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) activity in the
      urine to monitoring consumption of alcohol by pregnant women in first trimester
      and to assess the effect of ethyl alcohol on fetus development. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: 22 pregnant women, who did not declare consumption of ethanol containing
      drinks. The level of creatinine, GGT and HEX in urine was analysed. RESULTS:
      Preliminary results of our study indicate that determination of GGT and HEX
      activities could be useful in monitoring of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

TI  - [Pregnancy and alcohol consumption].
PG  - 47-50
AB  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes a major risk of Fetal Alcohol
      Syndrome (FAS). This article defines the three syndromes linked to alcohol
      consumption during pregnancy: (1) FAS, with or without confirmed maternal alcohol
      exposure; (2) alcohol-related birth defect (ARBD) (3) and alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). The article also reviews data on alcohol use 
      in pregnant women and in women of child-bearing age. The literature indicates
      that between 6% and 45% pregnant women have an at-risk alcohol use, and suggests 
      that brief counseling interventions designed to prevent at-risk alcohol use are
      effective. Studies assessing alcohol use and brief intervention efficacy in
      pregnant women in Switzerland are needed.

TI  - Fetal, infant, and child mortality in a context of alcohol use.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - Alcohol is an important element in the causal chain of risk for fetal, infant,
      and childhood mortality. Mortality risk is influenced by interactions of alcohol 
      with other environmental and genetic factors and temporal periods of
      susceptibility. In this paper we discuss four time periods (preconceptual,
      gestational, infancy, and childhood) where alcohol use may create a context of
      risk. Alcohol use in one period increases the risk of alcohol use in subsequent
      periods. Gestational alcohol use can influence risk of mortality from abuse of
      mother/fetus, can cause other adverse outcomes, and can result in fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASDs). In infancy alcohol use can increase risk from
      impairment of arousal in adults who use alcohol. Infants with gestational
      exposure can be behaviorally difficult with sleep disturbance, irritability, and 
      colic. This can increase the risk of harm or death, especially during periods of 
      caretakers' alcohol use. Caretakers' alcohol use and smoking are strongly
      correlated. The all-cause mortality rate in people diagnosed with fetal alcohol
      syndrome (FAS) is over 5%. All-cause mortality in siblings of diagnosed cases of 
      FAS is increased 530% compared to siblings of matched controls. We recommend that
      a context of alcohol use be considered as a marker for multifactorial risk in all
      fetal, infant, and child deaths. A schema to collect data on alcohol use is
      provided to increase awareness of alcohol use as an environmental risk marker for
      mortality.

TI  - Cost of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
PG  - 42-50
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common identifiable teratogenic cause of mental
      retardation, neurological deficit, mental disorders, and developmental
      disabilities. Accurate estimates of the cost of care for persons with FAS are
      essential for appropriate funding of health care, developmental disabilities
      services, special education, and other service systems, as well as prioritizing
      funding of public health prevention efforts. The cost of care for individuals
      with FAS can be conceptualized as the annual cost of care for one person or a
      population, or as the lifetime cost of care for an individual. Annual cost
      estimates for the United States range from $75 million in 1984 to $4.0 billion in
      1998. Estimates of lifetime cost vary from $596,000 in 1980 to $1.4 million in
      1988. After adjustments for changes in inflation and population, 2002 estimates
      of total annual cost and lifetime cost are higher. FAS is increasingly being
      recognized as a large public health problem with high potential for the
      prevention of future cases and for the prevention of excess disability and
      premature mortality in persons who are affected. Each day, from 6-22 infants with
      FAS are born in the United States, and as many as 87-103 more are born with other
      impairments resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Updated and improved cost
      data on FAS should be a research priority.

TI  - Alcohol consumption and other maternal risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome
      among three distinct samples of women before, during, and after pregnancy: the
      risk is relative.
PG  - 10-20
AB  - Data were obtained from three samples of women of childbearing age. One sample of
      women is from prenatal clinics serving Plains Indian women. The second sample is 
      of women from the Plains whose children were referred to special diagnostic
      developmental clinics, as their children were believed to have developmental
      issues consistent with prenatal alcohol consumption. The third sample is of women
      from South Africa, each of whom has given birth to a child diagnosed with full
      fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Data across samples conform to expected trends on
      many variables. For example, the maternal age at time of pregnancy, a major risk 
      factor for FAS, ranged from a mean of 23.5 years for the prenatal clinic sample, 
      to 23.8 years for the developmental clinic sample, to 27.6 for the sample of
      women who have delivered children with FAS. Other variables of maternal risk for 
      FAS expected from the extant literature, such as high gravidity and parity, binge
      drinking, heavy intergenerational drinking in the mother's extended family and
      immediate social network, and length of drinking career, were compared across the
      three samples with variable results. However, normative measures of drinking
      problems are unreliable when reported across cultures. An unexpected finding from
      this three-sample comparison was the differential risk found when comparing U.S. 
      women to South African women. Women in the U.S. Plains Indian samples report a
      high consumption of alcohol in a binge pattern of drinking, yet there is less
      detectable damage to the fetus than among the South African women. Body mass
      index (BMI) and lifelong and current nutrition may have a substantial impact,
      along with the above factors, in relative risk for an FAS birth. The level of
      risk for producing a child with FAS is influenced by environmental and behavioral
      conditions that vary between populations and among individual women. Also,
      because many syndromes are genetically based, there is a need for full behavioral
      and genetic histories of the mother, family, and child being studied. Collecting 
      extensive behavioral information as well as genetic histories will provide the
      requisite information for making an accurate diagnosis of FAS.

TI  - Monitoring prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - Alcohol use during pregnancy is a leading, preventable cause of birth defects and
      developmental disabilities in the United States, with fetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS) being one of the most severe outcomes. Current survey statistics find that 
      approximately one in eight pregnant women (500,000 per year) report alcohol use, 
      with approximately 80,000 reporting binge drinking. While annual rates have
      fluctuated, trends analysis finds that there has been no significant change in
      rates of prenatal alcohol exposure over the past 10-year period. Development of
      effective programs to prevent FAS and to monitor the success of prevention
      efforts requires epidemiological data systems to inform these activities. This
      article describes alcohol use patterns among childbearing-age women and data
      sources that can be used in monitoring this behavior.

PG  - 133-9
AB  - Maternal prenatal alcohol use is one of the leading preventable causes of birth
      defects and developmental disabilities. On the severe end of the spectrum of
      conditions related to drinking during pregnancy is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). 
      Physicians and other health practitioners play a critical role in diagnosing FAS 
      and in screening women of childbearing age for alcohol use during pregnancy. The 
      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Team at CDC's National Center on Birth Defects 
      and Developmental Disabilities awarded funds to four medical school partners
      (Meharry and Morehouse Medical Colleges, St. Louis University, the University of 
      Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and the University of California at Los
      Angeles) to develop FAS regional training centers (RTCs). The RTCs are
      developing, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating educational curricula for
      medical and allied health students and practitioners that incorporate
      evidence-based diagnostic guidelines for FAS and other prenatal alcohol-related
      disorders.

TI  - Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health Disparities 2002: a call to arms.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a "Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health
      Disparities 2002: A Call to Arms," on December 5, 2002, in Bethesda, Maryland,
      USA. This workshop was part of the NIAAA/NIH comprehensive strategic plan to
      reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities. Eleven topics were
      addressed: (1). biomedical risk factors that may contribute to disparities in the
      toxic effects of alcohol; (2). alcohol and gene-environment interactions that
      affect the health of diverse groups; (3). alcohol pharmacogenetics in
      Mexican-Americans; (4). determinants of risk for alcoholism in minority
      populations; (5). consideration of population groups in linkage-disequilibrium
      studies to identify genes associated with alcohol dependence; (6). interaction
      between alcohol dependence and African-American ethnicity in disordered sleep,
      nocturnal cytokines, and immunity; (7). disparities of brain functional reserve
      capacity affecting brain morbidity related to substance abuse; (8). alcohol and
      pregnancy disparities; (9). role of alcohol in cancer risk disparities; (10).
      ethnic diversity in alcoholic cardiomyopathy; and (11). postmenopausal health
      disparities. On the basis of these presentations, seven conclusions emerged: (1).
      Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes exist in various populations. 
      (2). These enzymes play a role in the variation in health effect outcomes seen in
      different populations, owing to alcohol consumption. (3). Differences between and
      among population groups can be critically important for the design and
      interpretation of studies in genetics. These include differences in expression of
      phenotype, in locus heterogeneity, in risk alleles, and in population structure. 
      (4). Incidence rates for fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders are greater in African-Americans and Native-Americans than in
      Caucasians. Genetic polymorphisms, nutrition, and other factors may account for
      these differences. (5). The highest mortality rate for cirrhosis has been found
      in white Hispanic men. (6). Mexican-Americans have a low frequency of the
      protective alleles ADH1B(*)2 and ALDH2(*)2 and a relatively high frequency of
      CYP2E1 c2, which is associated with early onset alcoholism. (7). The incidence
      rate for cancer is greater for African-Americans than for Caucasians, and part of
      the higher risk may be attributed to heavier drinking.

TI  - Maternal periconceptional alcohol consumption and risk for conotruncal heart
      defects.
PG  - 875-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study we investigated whether the risk of delivering infants 
      with conotruncal heart defects was increased among mothers who consumed alcohol
      during the periconceptional period (i.e., 1 month before conception to 3 months
      after conception). METHODS: Data were obtained from a population-based
      case-control study of California births from 1987-1988. Information concerning
      alcohol consumption was obtained via telephone interviews with mothers of 207
      (87% of eligibles) case infants and 481 (76%) nonmalformed control infants.
      RESULTS: Bivariate results indicated that relative to nonconsumers, women who
      consumed alcohol less than once a week had a 1.3-fold increased risk of
      delivering infants with a conotruncal heart defect (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      1.0, 1.9), and women who consumed alcohol once a week or more had a 1.9-fold
      increased risk (95% CI 1.0, 3.4). The risks associated with consuming five or
      more drinks per drinking occasion were 1.6 (95% CI 0.8, 3.2) for less than once a
      week, and 2.4 for once a week or more (95% CI 0.6, 9.7). The results for the
      phenotypic subgroups were similar to those for all cases. Adjustment for
      potential covariates resulted in somewhat weaker, but still elevated, risks.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the risk of conotruncal heart defects in
      offspring was moderately elevated among women who consumed alcoholic beverages
      during the periconceptional period, and that risk was higher with increased
      frequency of drinking or increased number of drinks consumed per occasion. Most
      of the risk estimates were imprecise, and chance could not be ruled out as an
      explanation for the observed findings.

TI  - Alcohol use in pregnant low-income women.
PG  - 773-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study had two aims: (1) to examine the prevalence rates of
      prenatal alcohol consumption in a group of women participating in the Special
      Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in Southern 
      California, with special emphasis on Hispanic women, and (2) to identify
      variables associated with postconception drinking in low-income minority women.
      METHOD: The study employed a cross-sectional survey that assessed alcohol use
      rates, demographic variables, and alcohol risk status. Participants were 826
      pregnant women enrolled in the Public Health Foundation Enterprises (PHFE) WIC
      Program in Los Angeles and Orange counties, California. Pregnant women who
      enrolled self-administered a specially designed alcohol screener. RESULTS:
      Findings were that 24% of sample women were consuming alcohol post conception. Of
      that percentage, approximately two thirds drank prior to pregnancy recognition,
      and one third continued to drink after pregnancy was confirmed. Approximately 30%
      of white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic and English-speaking Hispanic women
      were found to drink post conception compared with 15.8% of Spanish-speaking
      Hispanic women. This finding supported recent research that suggests more
      acculturated Hispanic women tend to incorporate the drinking patterns of the
      larger U.S. population to a greater extent than less acculturated Hispanic women.
      Although a number of demographic variables differentiated women who were
      abstinent from those who were postconception drinkers, the best predictor of
      postconception alcohol consumption was the woman's high-risk drinking score as
      measured by the TWEAK (sensitivity = 70.1%, specificity = 88.5%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Results suggest the importance of screening low-income minority pregnant women in
      a community setting so that interventions can be initiated to prevent fetal
      alcohol syndrome and related conditions.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: diagnosis, epidemiology, and developmental outcomes.
PG  - 2-7
AB  - In Australia the issue of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has not been the subject
      of policy development or of extensive research. There is a lack of knowledge,
      both in the general community and by health professionals, of the nature of the
      risks associated with heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the factors 
      that increase this risk. This paper reviews the literature surrounding FAS with
      the aim of providing the reader an understanding of the diagnostic features and
      epidemiology of FAS and of the developmental sequelae associated with this
      syndrome.

AB  - A description of an ongoing program for the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome 
      (FAS) and other alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs) is provided. The prevention
      program focuses on women with increased risk factors. Paraprofessionals were
      added to selected professional case management teams in Montana in both rural and
      urban settings. The pilot program is linked with existing public health programs 
      that are in place to help decrease the mortality of infants in Montana. A

TI  - Body mass index in fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 689-96
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prenatal alcohol exposure is an important cause of growth
      impairment. In this study we examined the stability of the growth measurements,
      including height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) percentiles, from birth to
      age at the time of diagnosis for subjects who were referred for evaluation to
      determine if they had fetal alcohol syndrome. METHODS: We utilized subjects from 
      the North Dakota Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Registry. Each person referred for
      assessment was provided a standardized assessment completed by a medical
      geneticist. We also examined differences in the diagnostic schema from the
      Institute of Medicine. The population consisted of 315 subjects with paired
      weight measurements, 234 subjects with paired height measurements, and 322
      subjects with current BMI measurements. RESULTS: Increases in weight percentiles 
      and decreases in height percentiles were found. Children with FAS had
      consistently lower growth measurements. There was significant movement in and out
      of lower 5th and 10th percentiles by partial and no FAS children from birth to
      diagnosis. DISCUSSION: The requirement for growth impairment needs to be broad
      rather than narrow, if most subjects with a diagnosis of FAS and partial FAS/ARND
      are to be captured.

TI  - Recognition and management of fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 681-8
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common cause of developmental disability,
      neuropsychiatric impairment and birth defects. The disorder is identified by the 
      presence of growth impairment, central nervous system dysfunction, and a
      characteristic pattern of craniofacial features. The reported prevalence of the
      disorder varies widely and recent estimates approach 1% of live births.
      Expression of these features varies by age. People with FAS have high rates of
      comorbid conditions: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (40%), mental
      retardation (15-20%), learning disorders (25%), speech and language disorders
      (30%), sensory impairment (30%), cerebral palsy (4%), epilepsy (8-10%). Birth
      defects are common. In the United States, the annual birth cohort of persons with
      FAS could be as high as 39,000 cases annually. Cause-specific mortality is 6% for
      patients with FAS. The disorder is expensive to treat and most patients have
      lifelong impairment. The annual cost of care in the United States would approach 
      US$5.0 billion. Early recognition and entry into appropriate treatment programs
      appear to improve outcome. Prevention efforts should involve screening for
      alcohol use prior to pregnancy and at the first prenatal care visit.

TI  - Assessing the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome: understanding substance use among
      pregnant women.
PG  - 667-74
AB  - Fetal alcohol exposure is a common cause of birth defects and developmental
      disorders. As many as 1 in 100 children in the United States are believed to be
      affected by fetal alcohol exposure. Characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS) include abnormal facial features, growth impairment, problems with
      learning, memory, attention span, problem solving, speech, and hearing. FAS is
      100% preventable. Preliminary data from 1704 pregnant women in Minnesota were
      assessed: substance use during pregnancy, risk factors related to substance use
      during pregnancy, and how substance use among pregnant women varies across the
      state. Of the sample, 19.6% of the women were calculated to have drunk alcohol
      while pregnant. Nondrinkers were more likely to be married and unemployed than
      drinkers. The drinkers reported significantly higher levels of depressed mood and
      greater number of problems with alcohol than their abstaining counterparts.
      Abstainers reported a greater number of pregnancies and initiated their first
      prenatal visit earlier than the drinkers. Significant differences in prenatal
      substance use and related factors also emerged by geographic region in Minnesota.
      Findings are discussed in relation to prevention and policy efforts.

PG  - 643-9
AB  - The Four-State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Consortium on the Studies of the
      Prevention of FAS is an effort to bring together resources, both human and
      material, across the states of Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota
      to decrease the prevalence of births affected by prenatal alcohol exposure.
      Beginning in September 2000, the Consortium received 3 years of funding and
      operates through a cooperative agreement with funding from the Center for
      Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
      Services Administration (SAMHSA). Three primary objectives are addressed through 
      the Consortium structure. These include: to develop and evaluate the formation of
      the Consortium itself; to develop an information base that systematizes data
      collection that helps determine populations and areas considered high risk; and
      to implement and test a scientific-based prevention/intervention model for women 
      considered high risk of abusing alcohol during their childbearing years.

TI  - Fetus at risk: prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy estimated with 
      a simple screening method in Swedish antenatal clinics.
PG  - 1513-20
AB  - AIMS: Maternal alcohol consumption is a major health hazard for the fetus. Sweden
      has an extensive system of public antenatal care clinics, whose mission is to
      detect and prevent this type of health hazards. However, very few cases of
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy are detected. The aim of this study was to
      examine the prevalence of hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy in a consecutive series of Swedish pregnant females. DESIGN, SETTING,
      PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
      (AUDIT) was used to collect anonymous data from consecutive pregnant subjects
      admitted during 1 year to an antenatal clinic in Stockholm, and signing up for
      parental education offered routinely (n = 1327). Data were obtained from 1101
      subjects, typically in pregnancy week 30. A complete AUDIT form was filled out
      referring to alcohol use during the year prior to pregnancy. A separate form with
      the consumption items from AUDIT was filled out to report behaviour during
      pregnancy. FINDINGS: For the year preceding pregnancy, 17% of subjects reported
      AUDIT scores of 6 or higher, indicating hazardous or harmful alcohol use in
      women. Few individuals reported scores of 13 or higher (indicating abuse or
      dependence), but almost half the subjects (46%) reported binge drinking (six
      standard drinks on a single occasion) once/month or more often, and 6% reported
      binge drinking on every occasion of alcohol consumption. One-third of the
      subjects (30%) continued regular alcohol use during pregnancy, and 6% reported
      consumption two to four times/month. In a logistic regression model, AUDIT scores
      for the year prior to pregnancy and subject age, but not education level were
      significant predictors of continued alcohol use during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Alcohol use during pregnancy is more extensive than has been presumed in Sweden. 
      Simple, clinically useful screening methodology detects hazardous consumption
      during pregnancy in a manner which regular antenatal care does not. If this
      methodology can be shown to have similar sensitivity when administered under
      non-anonymous conditions, it should be made part of routine antenatal care.

TI  - Learning following prenatal alcohol exposure: performance on verbal and visual
      multitrial tasks.
PG  - 33-47
AB  - Verbal Learning deficits have been reported following prenatal alcohol exposure
      (PAE). This study examined verbal and visual multitrial learning in children with
      fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) and controls matched 
      on age and gender from the same community. In this study, the FAS/FAE group's
      immediate memory on the Verbal Learning and Visual Learning tasks from the Wide
      Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML) was significantly weaker than
      that of the control group. Although the FAS/FAE group also recalled significantly
      less information after a delay, they did retain an equivalent proportion of the
      visual and verbal information as compared to the control group. Thus, the overall
      pattern of performance on both verbal and visual measures was consistent with
      that observed in previous studies of Verbal Learning: despite weaker learning,
      the FAS/FAE group's relative retention of information was no different than that 
      of controls.

      special emphasis on the neurological manifestations].
PG  - 601-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The microdeletion 22q11.2 affects 1/4000 live births and
      constitutes the most frequent interstitial chromosomal alteration in humans. It
      is involved in a heterogeneous series of phenotypic expressions. AIMS: To
      determine the most important clinical characteristics in a series of patients
      with this genetic molecular disorder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a
      retrospective study of 16 patients who had been diagnosed, by means of FISH or
      PCR, as having microdeletion 22q11.2, and the following data were evaluated in a 
      protocolised manner: sex, age, family background, characteristics of the
      pregnancy, birth, neonatal and post-neonatal periods, clinical and semiological
      data, as well as the results from the complementary explorations carried out
      according to the predominant pathology. RESULTS: The age at which the diagnosis
      was made oscillated between newly born and 8 years, with a predominance of males 
      over females in a ratio of 3.2/1. In all, 81% of patients presented neurological 
      disorders. Brain malformations were seen in six, hypoplasia of the anguli oris
      muscle in five, congenital facial palsy in three which was associated with brain 
      malformations in one patient, retarded neurodevelopment in six cases and
      neurogenic arthrogryposis in one. Other findings such as congenital heart disease
      (75%), skeletal disorders (37%), peculiar phenotypes (31%), nephrourological
      disorders (19%) and hypoacusis (19%) constitute significant manifestations of the
      process. Some of the most noteworthy occasional events include retarded height
      and weight development, hypocalcemia and cleft palate. In one case involving a
      child whose mother suffered from chronic alcoholism, there were both phenotypic
      traits of this entity and of foetal alcohol syndrome at the same time. In four of
      the patients the FISH technique did not detect the deletion, which was confirmed 
      by a technique involving DNA amplification with PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of
      central and peripheral neurological alterations, together with cardiac, skeletal,
      renal and auditory disorders was confirmed, as was the existence of
      neurodevelopmental retardation and a peculiar phenotype. Both the frequency and
      the kind of disorder coincided with what has been described earlier. A number of 
      facts stand out owing to their novelty. These include the high incidence of
      asymmetric crying facies, the existence of data compatible with foetal alcohol
      syndrome in one of the patients with this clinical entity, and the association
      with neurogenic arthrogryposis in another, which are circumstances that suggest
      the possibility of a causal relation with the deletion 22q11.2. Using DNA
      amplification with PCR is seen to be of greater diagnostic efficacy than the FISH
      technique.

TI  - Autism families with a high incidence of alcoholism.
PG  - 403-15
AB  - To determine the significance of neuropsychiatric disorders in autism families,
      we analyzed 167 pedigrees ascertained through an autistic child; 39% had
      alcoholism in patterns consistent with transmission of a genetic trait. Children 
      from high alcoholism families were more likely to have the onset of their
      autistic behavior occur with a loss of language (52.5% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.04). This
      occurred primarily in families where the mother was alcoholic (80% vs. 40%, p =
      0.05), suggesting an association between maternal alcoholism and regressive onset
      autism. Children from high alcoholism families were less likely to be
      macrocephalic (14.7% vs. 40.6%, p = 0.0006). Children from high alcohol and low
      alcohol families did not differ in dysmorphology status, IQ, sex ratio or sib
      recurrence risk.

TI  - Characteristics of mothers who have children with fetal alcohol syndrome or some 
      characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 296-303
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care providers can more effectively prevent fetal alcohol
      syndrome and prenatal alcohol exposure if they know more about mothers who have
      children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or some characteristics of FAS.
      METHODS: We conducted two retrospective case-control studies of Northern Plains
      Indian children with FAS and some characteristics of FAS diagnosed from 1981 to
      1993 by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
      Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71. We compared mothers who had
      children with FAS or some characteristics of FAS with mothers who had children
      that did not have FAS. RESULTS: Compared with control mothers, 43 mothers who had
      children with FAS and 35 mothers who had children with some characteristics of
      FAS were older, had fewer prenatal visits, more pregnancies, more mental health
      problems, and more injuries (both total and alcohol-related). Although the
      prevalence of drinking was high in both case and control mothers, case mothers
      had more alcohol-related medical problems, drank heavily, in binges, and daily
      more often than control mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Women with injuries and mental
      health problems should be screened for substance use. Mothers of children with
      FAS or of some characteristics of FAS have numerous needs that must be addressed 
      to prevent future prenatal alcohol exposure.

TI  - Current screening instruments related to alcohol consumption in pregnancy and a
      proposed alternative method.
PG  - 437-46
AB  - Because alcohol is a known teratogenic substance that negatively affects the
      fetus, screening for alcohol use is included in maternal child texts for nurses. 
      They present no standard screening approach, however. In the general literature, 
      a multitude of screening instruments exist for the purpose of detecting maternal 
      alcohol dependence but few allow the nurse to detect fetal alcohol exposure in
      the absence of maternal alcohol dependence. After a comparative analysis of
      existing screening instruments, we concluded that the Timeline Followback method 
      has the most utility as a screening instrument to detect fetal exposure to
      alcohol. The purpose of this article is to present a critical review of current
      screening instruments related to alcohol consumption in pregnant women and to
      propose the use of the Timeline Followback method as the preferred approach.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome--South Africa, 2001.
PG  - 660-2
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy
      and is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental
      disabilities. The FAS phenotype is characterized by a combination of facial
      dysmorphic features, growth retardation, and central nervous system (CNS)
      abnormalities. State-based estimates of the prevalence of FAS in the United
      States vary from 0.3 to 1.5 per 1,000 live-born infants. Recently, the highest
      prevalence of FAS worldwide was reported among first-grade children in a
      wine-growing region in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Investigators
      for the National Institutes of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) reported a
      FAS prevalence of 40.5 to 46.4 per 1,000 children aged 5-9 years in one community
      in Western Cape. To determine whether FAS was associated exclusively with the
      wine-growing region in Western Cape or was more endemic in other areas of the
      country, CDC, in collaboration with the University of Witwatersrand and the
      Foundation for Alcohol Related Research in Johannesburg, South Africa, conducted 
      a prevalence study in Gauteng province and is developing ongoing surveillance and
      prevention activities. This report summarizes the findings of the study, which
      indicate a high prevalence of FAS among first-grade children in four
      nonwine-growing communities around Johannesburg. Because South Africa has limited
      resources and many competing health problems (e.g., human immunodeficiency
      virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted 
      diseases), integrating prenatal alcohol-exposure prevention activities with
      existing prevention programs should be explored.

TI  - Deviations in brain early serotonergic development as a result of fetal alcohol
      exposure.
PG  - 337-42
AB  - Serotonin (5-HT) has specific roles not only as a transmitter but also as a
      signal for differentiation. We recently found that alcohol drinking during
      pregnancy resulted in incomplete-neural-tube-fusion which hindered the
      development of midline cells such as 5-HT neurons in mice. We now report that, at
      the birth of 5-HT neurons (E11), the 5-HT immunoreative (5-HT-im) neurons are
      often found missing medial projecting fibers towards ventricle in the Alcohol
      treated group (ALC) as compared with pair-fed (PF) and Chow-fed groups (Chow) in 
      mice. At E13, there are fewer 5-HT-im neurons in either dorsal or median raphe of
      ALC as compared with PF or Chow; furthermore, neurite outgrowth and migration of 
      the 5-HT neurons are also compromised with alcohol exposure. We, thus,
      demonstrated that fetal alcohol exposure compromised 5-HT development as early as
      at the 5-HT neuron birth. Since 5-HT is a signal for development of many
      forebrain neurons, the deviation of 5-HT in early life may have consequences on
      brain development that extend beyond those seen in the 5-HT system.

TI  - Neurocognitive impairment in early adolescence following prenatal alcohol
      exposure of varying duration.
PG  - 117-28
AB  - The aims of the study were, first, to perform a comprehensive assessment of
      neurocognitive status in early adolescence of children exposed to alcohol
      prenatally; and, second, to examine whether duration of exposure continues to be 
      predictive of outcome at this age. Twenty-seven exposed 12-14-year-olds and 39
      non-exposed 13-14-year-olds underwent neuropsychological assessments (WISC-III,
      NEPSY subtests) of attention and executive functions, language, visuomotor
      functions, and memory. The group of non-exposed children was used to develop
      preliminary test norms for the 13-14-year-old exposed children whereas published 
      test norms could be used for the 12-year-olds. The results demonstrated
      neurocognitive impairment across all types of tasks. Impairment varied in degree 
      according to the duration of alcohol exposure. Children exposed throughout
      pregnancy, most of who had diagnoses of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) or Fetal
      Alcohol Effects (FAE), performed well below the average range. It was concluded
      that the neurocognitive effects of alcohol exposure tend to be widespread and
      generalized. Attention and executive functions do not seem to be selectively
      affected. Further, the relationship between duration of prenatal alcohol exposure
      and neurocognitive development continues to be significant in early adolescence.

TI  - Motivational intervention to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies--Florida, Texas, 
      and Virginia, 1997-2001.
PG  - 441-4
AB  - Prenatal alcohol use is a threat to healthy pregnancy outcomes for many U.S.
      women. During 1999, approximately 500,000 pregnant women reported having one or
      more drinks during the preceding month, and approximately 130,000 reported having
      seven or more alcohol drinks per week or engaging in binge drinking (i.e., five
      or more drinks in a day). These heavier drinking patterns have been associated
      with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental
      disorders (ARND). Lower levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., fewer than seven
      drinks per week) also have been associated with measurable effects on children's 
      development and behavior. Although the majority of women reduce their alcohol use
      substantially when they realize they are pregnant, a large proportion do not
      realize they are pregnant until well into the first trimester and, therefore,
      might continue to drink alcohol during this critical period of fetal development.
      To reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies, CDC initiated a multisite pilot study
      (phase I clinical trial) in 1997 to investigate the use of a dual intervention
      focused on both alcohol-use reduction and effective contraception among
      childbearing-aged women at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (Project
      CHOICES). This report describes the association between baseline drinking
      measures and the success women have achieved in reducing their risk for an
      alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The analysis compares the impact of the motivational
      intervention at 6-month follow-up on women drinking at high-, medium-, and
      low-risk drinking levels. The findings indicate that although 69% of the women in
      the study reduced their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, women with the
      lowest baseline drinking measures achieved the highest rates of outcome success, 
      primarily by choosing effective contraception and, secondarily, by reducing
      alcohol use. Women with higher baseline drinking measures chose both approaches
      equally but achieved lower success rates for reducing their risk for an
      alcohol-exposed pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial of the motivational
      intervention is under way to further investigate outcomes of the phase I study.

TI  - Prevalence of prenatal drinking assessed at an urban public hospital and a
      suburban private hospital.
PG  - 85-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) varies within
      the population, few data are available concerning variation in the prevalence of 
      prenatal drinking. METHODS: Postpartum women delivering singleton infants at two 
      Atlanta hospitals in 1993 or 1994 were interviewed. Those delivering infants who 
      were small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 638) were over-sampled relative to
      those delivering infants with birth weights that were appropriate for gestational
      age (AGA) (n = 247). The prevalence of prenatal drinking was estimated as a
      weighted average of reports from mothers of SGA and AGA infants. Estimates of the
      prevalence of FAS come from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program
      (MACDP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: The
      prevalence of first-trimester drinking was half that reported for the three
      previous months (private hospital: 72% vs. 35%; public hospital: 52% vs. 28%).
      Most women (85%) reported abstaining throughout the second trimester. Fewer than 
      10% of women delivering at the public hospital (7.5%), but one-quarter of those
      delivering at the private hospital, reported third-trimester drinking. Binge,
      moderate and heavy drinking in pregnancy were more common among women delivering 
      at the public hospital. Eight infants born at the public hospital during this
      period, but none of those born at the private hospital, were identified as
      possibly having FAS; four of the eight were identified as probably having FAS.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for health education programs. For
      example, obstetricians in private practice may wish to reaffirm their advice to
      abstain from drinking in the third trimester. They also suggest that prenatal
      abstinence programs be targeted at populations identified as most likely to
      engage in risky drinking.

      risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. METHODS: A multisite single-arm pilot
      study was conducted in 6 community settings in 3 large cities. A total of 2384
      women were screened for eligibility; 230 were eligible on the basis of their
      alcohol use and lack of contraception. Of the eligible women, 190 consented and
      were enrolled, and 143 (75.3%) completed the 6-month follow-up. The intervention 
      consisted of 4 manual-guided motivational counseling sessions delivered by mental
      health clinicians and 1 contraceptive counseling session delivered by a family
      planning clinician. Outcome measures include intervention completion rates,
      alcohol use (frequency, quantity, and bingeing), contraceptive use and
      effectiveness, and risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy. RESULTS: Among women who
      completed the 6-month follow-up, 68.5% were no longer at risk of having an
      alcohol-exposed pregnancy; 12.6% of women who completed the program reduced
      drinking only; 23.1% used effective contraception only; and 32.9% reported both. 
      Results were consistent across the 6 diverse high-risk settings. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study provides evidence that providing 4 sessions of motivational
      interviewing plus a contraception counseling session is feasible and strongly
      suggests that this intervention can decrease the risk of alcohol-exposed
      pregnancy in women in high-risk settings. Additional investigation in a
      randomized controlled trial is warranted.

TI  - [Analysis of temporal evolution in alcohol consumption during pregnancy in the
      Spanish autonomic communities].
PG  - 535-41
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is considered as the
      main preventable cause of congenital defects and mental deficiency. We analyzed
      whether the consumption of alcohol during gestation has changed in Spain.
      SUBJECTS AND METHOD: We analyzed the evolution over the last 24 years, as well as
      the geographical distribution according to Spanish regions, of maternal alcohol
      consumption during pregnancy. We used data from the ECEMC, a registry which
      includes 1,820,862 liveborns, of whom 30,836 were malformed. A similar number of 
      healthy controls was collected. We established 5 increasing levels of alcohol
      consumption, for sporadic and diary intakes, and 3 levels of maternal
      scholarship. RESULTS: Except for the lowest and highest intakes, alcohol
      consumption levels showed a decreasing trend over the time. These tendencies were
      similar in almost all Spanish regions. When comparing the intake between regions,
      the differences were statistically significant. There was a correlation between
      the maternal scholarship and the alcohol intake, showing that the higher the
      education the lower the amount of alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The awareness
      of the alcohol effects is related to the maternal cultural level. Maternal
      consumption of alcohol varies across Spanish regions, though its trends are
      similar.

TI  - [A study of maternal psychological state among women with fetal alcohol effects
      (FAE) infants].
PG  - 597-604
AB  - Frequent alcohol drinking during pregnancy may result in facial dysmorphism,
      growth retardation and central nervous system deficits in infants ranging from
      Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). However, few studies
      has been done to empirical research the psychosomatic approach among women with
      FAE. In this study, twelve women with FAE infants were selected and interviewed
      at two or three days after delivery with CMI, MAS, and ANS-S, in order to
      elucidate the number of problems with mental health of them. All of women with
      FAE infants drank alcohol during the pregnancy consumed 2 or 3 drinks per week
      (ethanol consumption less than 92.0 gms per week). The mean mother's age of FAE
      infants is 30.2 years (range 27-35) and that of healthy mother is 30.3 years
      (range 24-35). Eleven of 12 (91.7%) infants were identified having the smooth
      philtrum, 9 (75.0%) with thin upper lip, 3 (25%) with hypersensitivity, 3 (25%)
      with sleeping disturbance, 2 (16.7%) with growth retardation. Eighty-three
      percent of infant with FAE had an adequate body weight and height. In comparison 
      with the women without FAE, women with FAE infants were noted to have a
      significant difference of the score of CMI (p < 0.0001), MAS (p < 0.0001), ANS-S 
      (p < 0.02). Psychosomatic interview revealed that women with FAE infants have
      increased anxiety neurosis and stress state. Seventy-five percent of women with
      FAE infants had an anxiety compared with control group (18.8%). Our findings in
      this study are important because 12 women with FAE infants were not alcoholics
      and did not consider themselves to have alcohol problems. Therefore, obstetrician
      has to cut down women alcohol intake considerably during pregnancy for preventing
      adverse fetal effects. Alcohol consumption and psychometric works also need to be
      done for detecting at risk use of alcohol during the pregnancy.

TI  - The Toronto experience in diagnosing alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder:
      a unique profile of deficits and assets.
PG  - 215-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which involves the triad of features
      reflecting facial dysmorphology, growth retardation and intellectual impairments,
      encompasses a relatively small proportion of the children affected prenatally by 
      alcohol. Unfortunately, in the absence of facial dysmorphology, the diagnosis is 
      difficult in the majority of children, who are considered to have alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Because accepted clinical methods are not
      pathognomonic, a novel profile approach was used to examine neuropsychological
      abilities and disabilities to identify children with ARND who do not meet the
      diagnostic criteria of FAS. OBJECTIVE: To establish a set of criteria, to be
      validated in future studies, for characterizing the neuropsychological profile of
      children with ARND. By describing the procedures at this preliminary stage of our
      work, the goal is to draw attention to this neglected topic and to suggest a
      model that can be replicated and validated by others, and to provide the first
      systematic clinical report on diagnosing ARND in Canada. PROCEDURES: On the basis
      of the literature, parents' descriptions and the authors' own experience with
      ARND, a profile of neuropsychological characteristics, including both deficits
      and assets, that are associated with prenatal alcohol exposure was hypothesized. 
      A group of children was then evaluated, mostly adoptees or children in foster
      care, who were referred for learning and behavioural problems potentially
      associated with gestational exposure. Their results were submitted to a profile
      analysis by comparing their deficits and assets according to a list describing a 
      hypothetical ARND profile to determine whether each child fit or did not fit the 
      ARND profile. Groups were compared for background characteristics, FAS
      symptomatology, and results on specific neuropsychological and behavioural tests.
      Finally, the characteristics most strongly differentiating the two groups were
      identified. SETTING: Hospital-based outpatient program. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two
      children aged four to 18 years who were referred for a diagnostic assessment
      related to suspected or known prenatal alcohol exposure. OUTCOME MEASURES: Each
      child's assessment results were compared against a list of 21 deficits and six
      assets by two independent raters. Children with an average of more than 60%
      deficits and 50% assets were considered to have ARND, while the remainder were
      not. RESULTS: Twenty-eight children (54%) were assigned to the ARND group and 24 
      to the non-ARND group. The groups did not differ in physical features or home
      background characteristics, with the exception of higher parental intelligence
      quotient in the non-ARND group. The ARND group was more likely to have repeated a
      grade or received special education and scored lower on standardized measures of 
      intelligence, language and memory abilities. Frequency of behaviour or social
      problems were equivalent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A profile approach used to 
      identify children with ARND discriminates problems in neuropsychological but not 
      behavioural domains. Because elevated scores on behavioural tasks in both ARND
      and non-ARND groups were clinically significant, more research is needed to
      identify what behavioural problems are unique to children with ARND compared with
      other clinic-referred children.

TI  - National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect: defining 
      the national agenda for fetal alcohol syndrome and other prenatal alcohol-related
      effects.
PG  - 9-12
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to serious birth defects and developmental
      disabilities. A need exists to develop effective strategies for both children
      with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or other prenatal alcohol-related effects and
      for women at high risk for having an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Since the
      syndrome was identified approximately 30 years ago, advancements have been made
      in FAS diagnostics, surveillance, prevention, and intervention, but a substantial
      amount of work remains. Collaborations among partners in federal state, and local
      agencies, academia, clinical professions, school systems, and families are
      critical to developing and implementing successful efforts related to FAS and
      fetal alcohol effect (FAE). In 1999, Congress directed the Secretary of the U.S. 
      Department of Health and Human Services to convene the National Task Force on FAS
      and FAE (the Task Force). CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and
      Developmental Disabilities, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Team, coordinates
      the Task Force and manages its operation. Since the Task Force was chartered in
      2000, Task Force members, with input from multiple partners, have convened to
      deliberate and determine the Task Force mission, goals, and priority concerns to 
      be addressed. This report describes the structure, function, mission, and goals
      of the Task Force and provides their first recommendations. An explanation of how
      the Task Force recommendations were generated and the Task Forces next steps are 
      also reported.

TI  - Biochemical markers of alcohol use in pregnant women.
PG  - 9-19
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the serious health consequences of alcohol (ethanol) use,
      especially as they relate to pregnancy and the development of fetal alcohol
      syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE). The classic markers of alcohol
      exposure, including blood/breath alcohol, gamma-glutamyl transferase (gammaGT),
      mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hemoglobin-associated acetaldehyde (HAA) and
      carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), are valuable and their methods of
      analysis are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Since both FAS and FAE represent two of the
      leading preventable causes of mental retardation and birth defects,
      identification of alcohol use early in pregnancy is important to avoid adverse
      fetal outcomes. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of FAS and FAE is usually made after
      birth, when alcohol damage has become irreversible and permanent. The clinical
      laboratory can help prevent this damage and make a valuable contribution in
      assessing prenatal alcohol use. The clinical utility of blood/breath alcohol,
      gammaGT, MCV, HAA and CDT in alcohol use identification, especially in pregnancy,
      is substantial. Although none of the markers singularly has adequate sensitivity 
      and specificity for screening, their diagnostic utility increases when measured
      as a panel. This is especially true in detecting alcohol use in pregnancy where
      the presence of several positive markers was correlated with the presence of
      alcohol-related fetal effects.

TI  - Interhemispheric transfer in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 1863-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure has long been associated with alterations
      in brain structure and behavioral changes. The corpus callosum can be affected by
      heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, and agenesis (absence) of this structure occurs 
      more often in children with fetal alcohol syndrome than in the general population
      or in other developmentally delayed populations. Although the majority of
      children with fetal alcohol syndrome do not have agenesis of the corpus callosum,
      callosal area is reduced in this population, particularly in the anterior and
      posterior regions. However, the functional implication of these size reductions
      has not been examined. METHODS: The current study used a finger localization task
      to measure the transfer of information across the corpus callosum in children and
      adolescents with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and age- and
      sex-matched controls. In a subset of children, correlational analysis was also
      conducted between behavioral data and cross-sectional area of the corpus
      callosum. RESULTS: When compared with nonexposed controls, alcohol-exposed
      children made more errors on trials for which information had to cross the corpus
      callosum ("crossed" trials) than on trials for which it did not ("uncrossed"
      trials), and they also made more errors as the task increased in complexity.
      Additionally, correlations with magnetic resonance imaging data in a subset of
      children revealed that impairment in interhemispheric transfer was related to
      reductions in the size of the corpus callosum. These correlations were
      independent of effects expected from the relationship between corpus callosum
      size and general intellectual functioning alone. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
      suggest that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure display subtle
      deficits in the interhemispheric transfer of information in the somatosensory
      domain. Such deficits in interhemispheric transfer are likely to be related to
      the myriad of other behavioral and cognitive impairments observed in these
      children.

TI  - Mapping cortical gray matter asymmetry patterns in adolescents with heavy
      prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 1807-19
AB  - Here we report on detailed three-dimensional quantitative maps of brain surface
      and gray matter density asymmetry patterns during normal adolescent development
      and show how these anatomical features of the brain are disrupted as a result of 
      prenatal exposure to large quantities of alcohol. We studied two independent
      samples of normally developing children, adolescents, and young adults, totaling 
      83 subjects from two different research groups, and compared them to 21
      individuals with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Surface-based image analysis
      techniques allowed us to match cortical anatomy across subjects and between
      hemispheres based on manually delineated sulcal landmarks. Quantitative maps of
      brain surface asymmetry reveal prominent peri-Sylvian hemispheric differences in 
      which the superior temporal and inferior parietal cortices are shifted backward
      in the left relative to the right hemisphere in both normal and alcohol-exposed
      subjects. Cortical surface gray matter asymmetry, mapped here in adolescent
      populations, is most prominent in the posterior inferior temporal lobes (right
      greater than left), and this effect does not differ between groups of normally
      developing children, adolescents, or young adults. Alcohol-exposed individuals
      show a significant reduction in this asymmetry, whether studied with
      surface-based or more traditional volumetric region of interest analyses. This
      region of cortex, near the junction of Brodmann's areas 21, 22, and 37, primarily
      subserves language functions that are known to be impaired on average in the
      alcohol-exposed subjects. Our findings elucidate regional patterns of brain
      surface and gray matter asymmetry during normal development and may contribute to
      a more comprehensive understanding of the neural substrates of cognitive
      dysfunction after heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.

TI  - Alcohol dehydrogenase 2 genotypes, maternal alcohol use, and infant outcome.
PG  - 780-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether different alleles of the ADH2 gene (ADH2-1,
      ADH2-2 and ADH2-3) with differing levels of enzymatic activity can alter the risk
      of fetal alcohol effects. STUDY DESIGN: ADH2 genotypes were performed on 404
      pregnant high-risk women and 139 infants as part of a larger study of alcohol use
      in pregnancy. Mothers were interviewed about alcohol use during pregnancy, and
      their infants were examined for alcohol-related features without knowledge of the
      exposure status. RESULTS: The ADH2-1/3 genotype was more prevalent among black
      women (46%) than expected (33%); the rate among white women was low as expected
      (2%). More black women who reported high alcohol use during the pregnancy had the
      ADH2-1/3 genotype compared with those who reported no alcohol use (70% vs 44%).
      Sixty percent of the affected black infants had the ADH2-1/3 genotype compared
      with 29% of the unaffected infants (P <.045). The maternal genotype correlated
      with her chance of having an infant with alcohol-related physical features (odds 
      ratio = 2.49). This association remained significant after accounting for
      confounders, such as smoking and maternal weight gain. Alcohol exposure was not
      significantly associated with infant outcome in black infants after accounting
      for genotype, smoking, and maternal weight gain, but this association could only 
      be tested in 10 infants of mothers with high exposure. CONCLUSION: Women with the
      ADH2-1/3 genotype may be at greater risk for having an affected infant, which may
      be the result of greater ingestion of alcohol.

TI  - Measurement of maternal alcohol consumption in a pregnant population.
PG  - 211-4
AB  - Alcohol is a known teratogenic substance that operates under a dose-response
      mechanism. Before we conducted a larger study that examines the use of alcohol
      both before pregnancy and during pregnancy, it was important to pilot our method 
      for measuring a pregnant mother's alcohol use that would allow us to capture the 
      number of drinks consumed per day while addressing recall bias. The purpose of
      this study was 1) to pilot the Time Line Followback (TLFB) method developed by
      Sobell and Sobell (1992, Measuring Alcohol Use. Totowa, NJ: Humana Press) as a
      method for examining alcohol use during pregnancy and 2) to determine if the use 
      of a study protocol that included biological markers of alcohol use would affect 
      our ability to recruit subjects. Using a descriptive design, we tested our
      protocol for collecting alcohol use data with 10 mothers receiving prenatal care.
      We measured alcohol use using the TLFB method (Sobell and Sobell, 1992, Measuring
      Alcohol Use. Totowa, NJ: Humana Press, 1996). We also collected collected
      biological blood markers for heavy alcohol use. Of the 10 maternal subjects we
      recruited, 5 mothers (50%) reported alcohol use during pregnancy. We successfully
      recruited 10 out of 11 mothers approached and had a 100% retention rate for the
      second interview. The TLFB method is viable for measuring fetal alcohol exposure 
      over the pregnancy, and the collection of blood samples did not impact our
      ability to recruit or retain mothers.

TI  - Application of the fetal alcohol syndrome facial photographic screening tool in a
      foster care population.
PG  - 712-7
AB  - We determined the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a foster care
      population and evaluated the performance of the FAS Facial Photographic Screening
      Tool. All children enrolled in a Washington State Foster Care Passport Program
      were screened for three conditions: (1) the FAS facial phenotype from a
      photograph, (2) evidence of brain damage with prenatal alcohol exposure from
      their Health and Education passport, and/or (3) other syndromes identifiable from
      a facial photograph. Screen-positives received diagnostic evaluations at a FAS
      Diagnostic and Prevention Network clinic. The prevalence of FAS in this foster
      care population was 10 to 15/1000, or 10 to 15 times greater than in the general 
      population. The screening tool performed with 100% sensitivity, 99.8%
      specificity, 85.7% predictive value positive, and 100% predictive value negative.
      We conclude that the foster care population is a high-risk population for FAS.
      The screening tool performed with very high accuracy and could be used to track
      FAS prevalence over time in foster care to accurately assess the effectiveness of
      primary prevention efforts.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure predicts continued deficits in offspring size at 14
      years of age.
PG  - 1584-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth deficits are among the cardinal features for the diagnosis of 
      fetal alcohol syndrome. Growth deficits have also been noted among those who were
      exposed to alcohol prenatally but who do not have fetal alcohol syndrome. Few
      studies have observed subjects past early and middle childhood, however, to
      evaluate the longer-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth in
      adolescence. This is a report of the effects of alcohol exposure during gestation
      on the size of the offspring at 14 years of age. METHODS: Women were recruited in
      their fourth prenatal month. These women were interviewed in the fourth and
      seventh months of pregnancy and at delivery. The women and their children were
      seen when the offspring were 14 years of age. RESULTS: Growth deficits associated
      with prenatal alcohol exposure were identified among the offspring at 14 years of
      age. Weight, height, head circumference, and skinfold thickness continued to be
      significantly affected by prenatal alcohol exposure after controlling for other
      significant predictors of size. These effects exhibited a dose-response pattern, 
      and significant effects were found at levels below one drink per day. For
      example, first trimester alcohol exposure predicted weights of 152 lbs for the
      offspring of abstainers, 149 lbs for the offspring of light drinkers (>0 and <0.2
      drinks per day), 143 lbs for the offspring of moderate drinkers (>0.2 and <0.89
      drinks per day), and 136 lbs for the offspring of heavy drinkers (>0.89 drinks
      per day). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure continues to affect size at age 
      14 years in this cohort of children followed since their fourth month of
      gestation.

AB  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have numerous adverse health
      consequences for the developing fetus, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and
      alcohol-related effects, and therefore is a significant public health problem. A 
      variety of programs have been developed to prevent drinking during pregnancy and 
      the resulting health problems. Some of these efforts, such as public service
      announcements and beverage warning labels, are universal and strive to increase
      the public's knowledge about FAS. Selective prevention approaches target women of
      reproductive age who drink alcohol. Such approaches may involve screening all
      pregnant women for alcohol consumption and counseling those women who do drink.
      Indicated prevention approaches target high-risk women (e.g., women who have
      previously abused alcohol or have had a child with FAS or other alcohol-related
      effects) and typically offer repeated counseling over several years. Both
      selective and indicated prevention efforts can reduce maternal alcohol
      consumption and improve the outcome of the offspring.

TI  - Regional brain shape abnormalities persist into adolescence after heavy prenatal 
      alcohol exposure.
PG  - 856-65
AB  - We assessed regional brain shape abnormalities and spatial relationships between 
      brain shape and abnormalities observed in the underlying tissue in children and
      adolescents prenatally exposed to large quantities of alcohol. We used high
      resolution, 3-D, structural magnetic resonance imaging data and novel,
      whole-brain, surface-based image analysis procedures to study 21 subjects with
      heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (8-22 years, mean age 12.6 years) and 21 normally
      developing control subjects (8-25 years, mean age 13.5 years). Significant brain 
      size and shape abnormalities were observed in the alcohol-exposed subjects in
      inferior parietal/ perisylvian regions bilaterally, where their brains appeared
      to be narrower than those of the controls in the same general location where they
      also had increased gray matter density. Highly significant decreased brain
      surface extent or reduced brain growth was also observed in the ventral aspects
      of the frontal lobes most prominent in the left hemisphere. For the first time in
      this report we have mapped brain morphologic abnormalities to the cortical
      surface in subjects with prenatal alcohol exposure and have shown that the size
      and shape of the brain is altered in these individuals. The results imply that
      brain growth continues to be adversely affected long after the prenatal insult of
      alcohol exposure to the developing brain and the brain regions most implicated,
      frontal and inferior parietal/ perisylvian, may be consistent with behavioral
      deficits characteristic of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome--Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, and New York, 1995-1997.
PG  - 433-5
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy
      and is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental
      disabilities in the United States. FAS is diagnosed on the basis of a combination
      of growth deficiency (pre- or postnatal), central nervous system (CNS)
      dysfunction, facial dysmorphology, and maternal alcohol use during pregnancy.
      Estimates of the prevalence of FAS vary from 0.2 to 1.0 per 1,000 live-born
      infants. This variation is due, in part, to the small size of the populations
      studied, varying case definitions, and different surveillance methods. In
      addition, differences have been noted among racial/ethnic populations. To monitor
      the occurrence of FAS, CDC collaborated with five states (Alaska, Arizona,
      Colorado, New York, and Wisconsin*) to develop the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
      Surveillance Network (FASSNet). This report summarizes the results of an analysis
      of FASSNet data on children born during 1995-1997, which indicate that FAS rates 
      in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, and New York ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 per 1,000
      live-born infants and were highest for black and American Indian/Alaska Native
      populations. This study demonstrates that FASSNet is a useful tool that enables
      health care professionals to monitor the occurrence of FAS and to evaluate the
      impact of prevention, education, and intervention efforts.

TI  - Beverage choice among native american and african american urban women.
PG  - 218-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about beverage preference, especially among
      understudied urban minority populations. Also, most studies do not differentiate 
      between beer and malt liquor or among wine, wine coolers, and fortified wine.
      This article examines whether ethnicity or drinking frequency are associated with
      beverage choice, considering six types of alcoholic beverages: beer, wine,
      spirits, malt liquor, fortified wine, and wine coolers. METHODS: Data were
      analyzed from Native American (n = 70) and African American (n = 129) urban
      pregnant women who reported drinking in the 12 months before an index pregnancy. 
      A small comparison group of white women (n = 22) was included. Women were queried
      about their consumption of each of six beverage types during the 12 months before
      pregnancy. RESULTS: The alcoholic beverage most often used, adjusted for other
      beverages consumed, was beer, followed in order by spirits, wine coolers, malt
      liquor, wine, and fortified wine. The Native American women preferred beer, which
      accounted for one third of total intake. In contrast, malt liquor and spirits
      each accounted for approximately a quarter of intake among African Americans.
      Compared with other drinkers, women who drank daily were significantly more
      likely to choose the beer and wine products with a higher alcohol content. In
      general, these bivariate results were borne out by multivariate analyses that
      controlled for age, marital status, and education. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
      suggest that when accuracy is desired, alcohol studies focusing on urban African 
      American samples (and, to a lesser degree, Native American respondents) should
      consider not just beer, wine, and spirits consumption, but also stronger beer
      products, such as malt liquor; stronger wine products, such as fortified wine;
      and sweeter products, such as wine coolers.

TI  - Characteristics of mothers of children with fetal alcohol syndrome in the Western
      Cape Province of South Africa: a case control study.
PG  - 6-17
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and with 
      fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) births were examined as part of a larger
      epidemiologic study of FAS in a community in the Western Cape Province of South
      Africa. METHOD: Using retrospective case-control methodology, 31 mothers who had 
      given birth to FAS children 6 to 9 years previously were compared with 31 matched
      controls on a variety of demographic, socioeconomic, drinking, family and
      maternity variables. Descriptive analyses were utilized to determine major
      differential characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: In this community
      with a very high rate of FAS and rather uniform low socioeconomic status, the two
      groups were found to be comparable with respect to age, annual income, ethnic
      background, age of initiation of regular drinking, age at birth of the index
      child, gravidity and parity. However, mothers of FAS children reported initiating
      drinking at an earlier age, as well as reporting higher rates of heavy alcohol
      consumption in their extended family, current use of alcohol, drinking before and
      during pregnancy, and smoking of tobacco (percentage who smoke) during each
      trimester of the pregnancy. Mothers of FAS children had lower educational
      attainment and reported lower religiosity than control mothers. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study in South Africa draws upon the experience of mothers of 31 children with
      FAS to confirm many of the same high-risk variables identified in maternal risk
      studies in the United States and Europe. Some factors associated with less
      maternal alcohol abuse in this high-risk population were also identified, which
      may be helpful for implementing prevention in this region as well as in other
      developing countries.

TI  - [Clinical study and prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in medico-social
      institutions of the Reunion Island].
PG  - 14-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a major problem in the Reunion Island
      and the Public Health Authorities decided to determine its prevalence in their
      medico-social centers on 31 December 1996. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire 
      was established to identify affected patients in the 20 medico-social centers in 
      charge of 1320 children. Eighty-eight children were selected and 87 could be
      analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-four of 87 (76.3%) were FAS and 23 of 87 (23.7%) had
      closely alcohol-related diseases. The prevalence was between 7.1 and 14.1% and
      lower than expected from available data. CONCLUSION: The study allowed to precise
      the social and familial factors predisposing to alcohol addiction during
      pregnancy. A TV prevention message will be broadcasted after this study.

TI  - MRI findings in children with school problems who had been exposed prenatally to 
      alcohol.
PG  - 98-106
AB  - This study examined 17 children (nine males, eight females; mean age 13 years)
      with prenatal alcohol exposure of various durations. The aim of the study was to 
      detect specific brain morphological alterations by means of MRI and to see if
      findings correlated with particular cognitive deficits. Of the 17 children, five 
      had been exposed to heavy maternal consumption of alcohol (over 10 drinks/week)
      during the first trimester only; four had been exposed during the first and
      second trimester; and eight had been exposed throughout pregnancy. Five children 
      had alcohol related neurobehavioural disorder, seven were diagnosed as having
      foetal alcohol effects and five were diagnosed as having foetal alcohol syndrome.
      Hypoplasia of the vermis was observed in 10 children and malformed posterior
      vermis in one additional child. Five children had hypoplastic cerebellar
      hemispheres. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum was observed in two children.
      Small hippocampi were observed in three children and wide cortical sulci in six. 
      No specific structural anomaly correlated with a particular neuropsychological
      deficit. In this study, deviations in the development of the vermis was the most 
      sensitive morphological indicator of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It
      was seen in every diagnostic group including children who had been exposed during
      only the first trimester of pregnancy.

TI  - Corpus callosum shape and neuropsychological deficits in adult males with heavy
      fetal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 233-51
AB  - Persons with brain damage consequent to prenatal alcohol exposure have typically 
      been diagnosed with either fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects 
      (FAE), depending on facial features. There is great variability of behavioral
      deficits within these groups. We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with 
      neurocognitive and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over
      the variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline curves of
      the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions from T1-weighted
      MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15 with FAE, and 15 who were
      unexposed and clinically normal. From 5 h of neuropsychological testing we
      extracted 260 scores and ratings pertaining to attention, memory, executive
      function, fine and gross motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline
      shape was analyzed by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to
      behavior by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly more
      variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With the excess shape
      variation are associated two different profiles of behavioral deficit unrelated
      to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE distinction within the exposed subgroup. A
      relatively thick callosum is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive
      function; one that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two 
      combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed from the
      unexposed in this sample. Thus there is considerable information in callosal form
      for prognosis of neuropsychological deficits in this frequently encountered birth
      defect.

TI  - A case-control study of maternal alcohol consumption and intrauterine growth
      retardation.
PG  - 497-503
AB  - PURPOSE: Heavy maternal drinking during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome, 
      but whether more moderate alcohol consumption is associated with such adverse
      pregnancy outcomes as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) remains
      controversial. METHODS: Using data from a case-control study, we examined the
      association between maternal alcohol consumption and risk for IUGR among 701 case
      and 336 control infants born during 1993-1995 in Monroe County, New York.
      RESULTS: Our results provide no evidence of an independent association between
      moderate maternal alcohol consumption (<14 drinks per week) and risk for IUGR.
      The risk for IUGR among heavy drinkers (> or =14 drinks per week) around the time
      of conception was OR = 1.4 (95% CI 0.7-2.6) for IUGR < or = 5th percentile and OR
      = 1.4 (95% CI 0.7-2.8) for IUGR 5th-10th percentile. For heavy drinkers during
      the first trimester, the OR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.4-4.5) for IUGR < or = 5th
      percentile and OR = 1.3 (95% CI 0.4-4.8) for IUGR 5th-10th percentile.
      CONCLUSIONS: Since IUGR is a heterogeneous outcome with a possible multifactorial
      origin, further studies are needed to examine the combined effects of alcohol and
      other environmental and genetic factors on IUGR risk for subgroups of IUGR.

TI  - The subtle facial signs of prenatal exposure to alcohol: an anthropometric
      approach.
PG  - 215-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to demonstrate that an objective, multivariate case
      definition of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial fetal alcohol syndrome
      (PFAS) can be derived by means of craniofacial anthropometry. STUDY DESIGN:
      Craniofacial measurements (n = 21) were taken of 100 individuals who had been
      exposed to alcohol before birth (41 FAS, 59 PFAS) and 31 members of a control
      group. Multivariate discriminant analysis was used to identify craniofacial
      measurements that best differentiated the 3 groups (FAS, PFAS, and control).
      RESULTS: Both the FAS and PFAS groups had a unique craniofacial phenotype that
      could be accurately discriminated from that of the control group. Stepwise
      discriminant analysis identified 6 craniofacial measurements that could
      differentiate individuals with and without prenatal alcohol exposure with 96%
      accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 90% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with FAS
      and PFAS have a distinctive facial phenotype that can be characterized
      anthropometrically. The phenotypic case definition could be used as a screening
      tool to identify individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol who do not exhibit a
      "classic" FAS phenotype but exhibit a more subtle craniofacial dysmorphia.

TI  - Pre-pregnancy drinking: how drink size affects risk assessment.
PG  - 1199-209
AB  - AIMS: We considered the role of drink size in determining average daily
      consumption among groups at risk for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. DESIGN: In-person
      hour-long interviews gathered cross-sectional retrospective data about drinking
      before an index pregnancy. SETTING: Subjects were recruited at public clinics in 
      Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area. To reach those not necessarily
      seeking prenatal care, community outreach in the same urban areas was undertaken.
      PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and twenty-one pregnant women were interviewed: 102
      Native Americans, 185 African Americans, and 34 Caucasians. MEASUREMENTS: Volume 
      of drinking prior to pregnancy was assessed using the graduated frequency series,
      which asks respondents to specify their drinking in terms of standard drinks.
      Using vessel models and photographs, respondent-defined drink sizes were then
      determined, and volume was recalculated accordingly. FINDINGS: For most
      beverages, the difference in milliliters between self-selected drink size and a
      standard size drink was significant, with the mean self-selected drink sizes
      ranging from 49% above the standard size (for beer) to 307% above the standard
      size (for spirits). For women whose pre-pregnancy average daily volume (ADV) was 
      at the risk level of > or = 1 standard drink per day, ADV increased from four to 
      almost 10 standard drinks per day when self-defined drink sizes were instead
      considered. Similarly, for women having three or more standard drinks a day,
      their daily dose of ethanol increased from 57 g to 153 g of ethanol per day.
      CONCLUSIONS: If risk levels have been based on underestimates that assume women
      with alcohol-affected infants had standard drink sizes, then true risk levels may
      be higher than previously thought. Related, risk drinkers presenting at prenatal 
      clinics may be missed if screening protocols do not ask about drink size.

TI  - Infants exposed to alcohol prenatally: outcome at 3 and 7 months of age.
PG  - 127-34
AB  - To investigate early recognition of the consequences of alcohol exposure in
      utero, we studied 79 infants at the ages of 3 and 7 months. Twenty-nine of them
      were exposed to varying levels of maternal alcohol intake and 50 had no exposure 
      and formed a control group. Special attention was paid to fetal alcohol
      syndrome-related facial features, neurological development and behavioural
      performance of the infants. To monitor facial features, pictures were taken at 3 
      and 7 months of age. Significant differences in facial features were found
      between the alcohol-exposed and non-exposed children at 3 months only. An
      age-adequate neurological examination showed no significant difference at 3
      months but a significant difference at 7 months of age between the
      alcohol-exposed infants and the controls. Mothers reported more misbehaviour in
      the exposed than in the non-exposed group. These results indicate that it is
      possible to recognise alcohol-related defects within the 1st year of life thus
      allowing early intervention.

TI  - Mapping callosal morphology and cognitive correlates: effects of heavy prenatal
      alcohol exposure.
PG  - 235-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC) have been documented in
      fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), ranging from subtle decrements in its size to
      partial and even complete agenesis. Prenatal exposure to alcohol is also known to
      result in neurocognitive deficits. OBJECTIVE: To 1) investigate abnormalities in 
      size, shape, and location of the CC within the brain in individuals with FAS and 
      in those exposed to high amounts of alcohol prenatally but without FAS (PEA
      group); and 2) determine if there is a relationship between callosal
      dysmorphology and cognitive test performance. METHODS: MRI and novel
      surface-based image analytic methods were used. Twenty alcohol-exposed subjects
      (8 to 22 years) along with 21 normal controls (8 to 25 years) were studied with
      high-resolution MRI and measures of verbal learning and visuospatial abilities.
      RESULTS: In addition to callosal area reductions, most severe in the splenium,
      the CC is significantly displaced in patients exposed to alcohol prenatally. In
      the alcohol-exposed group, this structure lies more anterior and inferior in
      posterior regions with relatively normal localization of anterior regions. These 
      findings are significant in the FAS group, and a similar but less severe pattern 
      is observed in the PEA patients. The authors show that the amount of CC
      displacement is correlated with impairment in verbal learning ability and that CC
      displacement is a better predictor of verbal learning than regional CC area. The 
      brain-behavior relationship is only significant within the alcohol-exposed group,
      and the effect is not solely mediated by overall impaired verbal intellectual
      functioning. CONCLUSIONS: These results further emphasize the vulnerability of
      midline brain structures to prenatal alcohol exposure.

TI  - Maternal substance use during pregnancy and developmental outcome at age three.
PG  - 329-40
AB  - PURPOSE: The data from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) and
      its 3-year follow-up offer a unique opportunity to study the effects of substance
      (alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco) use during gestation on development at age
      three in a nationally representative sample. Using this data, the relationship of
      development (language, gross motor, fine motor, and adaptive behavior) and
      specific behaviors (eating problems, length of play, activity level, difficulty
      of management, level of happiness, fearfulness, ability to get along with peers, 
      tantrums, eating nonfood) and maternal drinking, marijuana use, and cigarette
      smoking was studied in a sample of live births who had been followed up at age
      three. METHODS: The data were analyzed using a cumulative logit model of ordinal 
      responses. RESULTS: Higher activity level, greater difficulty of management,
      tantrums, eating problems, and eating nonfood were related to maternal drinking
      during pregnancy. Increased fearfulness, poorer motor skills, and shorter length 
      of play were associated with maternal marijuana use during pregnancy. Less well
      developed language, higher activity level, greater difficulty of management,
      fearfulness, decreased ability to get along with peers, and increased tantrums
      were associated with maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy. The
      preponderance of significant effects involved the behaviors studied rather than
      the developmental indices. IMPLICATIONS: It may be that the effects of substance 
      use during pregnancy, especially more subtle ones, show up in behavior before
      they can be measured by developmental scales.

TI  - Alcohol and eye diseases: a review of epidemiologic studies.
PG  - 397-402
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic evidence for the associations of alcohol consumption
      with eye diseases was gathered. METHOD: A literature review was conducted.
      RESULTS: In addition to alcohol-induced ocular anomalies among children with
      fetal alcohol syndrome, epidemiologic studies in the past two decades have
      demonstrated that chronic alcoholism is associated with a significantly increased
      risk of cataract, keratitis, color vision deficiencies and corneal arcus.
      Moderate alcohol use, however, has been reported to be possibly protective
      against age-related macular degeneration, cataract and diabetic retinopathy.
      CONCLUSIONS: It is evident that through its biologic effects and effects on
      nutrient deficits alcohol plays a role in a variety of eye diseases. Information 
      on the patient's drinking history can be clinically valuable and should be
      collected on a routine basis.

TI  - Verbal and nonverbal fluency in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 239-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Executive function deficits, including verbal fluency, have been
      documented in children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure. Whereas
      nonverbal fluency impairments have been reported in adults with such exposure,
      these abilities have not been tested in children. Deficits in both verbal and
      nonverbal fluency were predicted and assessed in children and adolescents with
      histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. METHOD: There was a total of 28
      (54% female) subjects; children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with (n =
      10) and without (n = 8) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were compared to nonexposed 
      controls (n = 10) on the design and verbal fluency measures from the Delis-Kaplan
      Executive Function System. Both fluency measures consist of three conditions,
      including a new set-shifting task. All tests require the generation of multiple
      responses within both rule and time constraints. RESULTS: Data were analyzed
      using repeated measures analyses of variance and hierarchical regression
      analyses. Compared to controls, children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure
      with and without FAS displayed deficits in both fluency domains, but did not
      differ from each other. In addition, prenatal alcohol exposure was a significant 
      predictor of performance on the set-shifting design fluency task above and beyond
      performance on more traditional fluency tasks. IQ was not a significant predictor
      for the traditional or set-shifting fluency measures, whereas diagnostic group
      remained a significant predictor when IQ was included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study adds to the literature on the integrity of executive functions in
      children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, documenting fluency impairment in 
      both verbal and nonverbal domains. It is important to note that these impairments
      were demonstrated in higher functioning alcohol-exposed children, both with and
      without FAS, and that diagnostic group explained such deficiencies above and
      beyond general intellectual ability.

      (FAS) prevention.
PG  - 333-45
AB  - Despite public health campaigns and clinical interventions that encourage women
      to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy, some women continue to drink while
      pregnant. To provide a more in-depth understanding of how at-risk women
      regard--and emotionally react to--warnings about drinking alcohol during
      pregnancy, we conducted focus groups in 1997 with 11 pregnant and recent
      postpartum Native American and African American women in Los Angeles, California.
      The main objective of these groups was to uncover relevant aspects of women's
      beliefs and opinions about drinking during pregnancy that may not have been
      elicited by other research instruments. Results would then be used to shape a
      large survey of pregnant at-risk women. Analysis of the transcripts revealed
      three emergent themes, which had the greatest impact on our subsequent survey.
      These were women's exposure to and perceived believability of messages, their
      perception of risk associated with drinking, and the barriers to cutting down on 
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Questions added to our survey instrument
      because of these findings included whether women think that some alcohol
      beverages are safer to drink than others; how they value cutting back alcohol
      use; their views on the irreversibility of fetal alcohol syndrome; and what
      pressures they feel from peers and family to drink during pregnancy. Given the
      small sample size associated with focus groups, these results cannot be
      generalized to larger populations; however, these women's words revealed
      important underlying issues and barriers that should be considered in studying
      and intervening with larger representative samples.

PG  - 699-708
AB  - The association between deficits in emotion-related learning, conceptual set
      shifting, and behavioral problems was investigated in individuals with
      substantial prenatal alcohol exposure. Twenty subjects with confirmed prenatal
      alcohol exposure (10 of whom were diagnosed as having Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) and
      20 normal controls matched for age, gender, and ethnic background participated.
      The two groups were administered a battery of tests including two tests of
      emotion-related learning (visual discrimination reversal and extinction of
      reward-response associations), tests of conceptual set shifting and intellectual 
      ability, and behavioral measures. The alcohol-exposed group made fewer reversals 
      than the control group in visual discrimination reversal and exhibited more
      variability in extinction. These group differences remained significant after
      controlling for intellectual ability and conceptual set shifting. Variability in 
      extinction and two measures of set shifting, perseverative errors on the
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and omission errors on reversal learning, were found 
      to be robust predictors of parent-rated behavioral problems.

TI  - Altered emotional perception in alcoholics: deficits in affective prosody
      comprehension.
PG  - 362-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Affective prosody is a nonlinguistic aspect of language that conveys 
      emotion and attitude during discourse. It is a dominant function of the right
      hemisphere. Because skills associated with the right hemisphere have been found
      to be impaired in alcoholics, this study explored the possibility that affective 
      prosodic functioning may be sensitive to the effects of alcohol due to heavy
      persistent drinking or prenatal exposure. METHODS: Subjects were aged 25 to 58
      years. Twenty-nine men and three women who met DSM-IV criteria for an alcohol use
      disorder with a median of 39 days of sobriety, 11 men with a probable history of 
      fetal alcohol exposure (FAexp), and 41 age-matched control subjects of both sexes
      were tested by using the Aprosodia Battery. This instrument assesses affective
      prosodic comprehension (APC) across a range of verbal articulatory demands.
      RESULTS: The alcoholic group scored 2 SD below the control mean, and the FAexp
      group scored -5 SD regardless of whether they had ever been diagnosed with
      alcohol abuse. Despite their poor performance on APC, alcoholic and FAexp groups 
      performed similarly to the control group on vocabulary, abstract reasoning, and
      an index of cognitive impairment that used the Shipley Institute of Living Scale.
      Multiple regression analyses that used nine alcohol use variables to model APC
      resulted in four significant contributors to the effect. These regressors were
      related to early exposure to ethanol and chronicity of alcohol abuse.
      CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholics and FAexp subjects were significantly less accurate at
      APC compared with controls. These alcohol-exposed subjects appear to be deficient
      in the ability to understand emotional valence in the speech of others, which
      results in errors of judgment that may impair social interactions.

TI  - An alternative to standard drinks as a measure of alcohol consumption.
PG  - 67-78
AB  - Despite the field's longstanding concern with underreporting of alcohol
      consumption, traditional survey questions encourage error because respondents
      often must calculate their number of drinks based on standard drink sizes that
      often do not match their own drinking style. This study considered how often
      respondents' self-defined drink sizes matched a 'standard' drink size based on
      approximately 12 g of ethanol for six different beverages. We also studied
      whether respondents could accurately judge the size of their drinks. Subjects
      were recruited and interviewed at urban prenatal clinics, health clinics, and via
      snowball referrals and community outreach in Los Angeles and the San Francisco
      Bay Area. Because of the urgency of accurate measurement of consumption during
      pregnancy, urban pregnant women from the groups most at risk for Fetal Alcohol
      Syndrome, Native Americans (n = 102) and African Americans (185), were targeted. 
      A small comparison group of urban pregnant white women (n = 34) was included.
      One-hour in-person interviews were conducted. Self-defined drink sizes were
      determined for each beverage consumed, using models and photographs of vessels.
      Frequent drinkers and the majority of women who reported drinking higher alcohol 
      content beverages reported drinking larger-than-standard drink sizes. The median 
      size of a malt liquor drink among the daily drinkers was almost three times as
      large as the standard, their fortified wine drinks were four times the standard, 
      and their spirits drinks were six times the standard size. The majority of
      drinkers of each beverage were unable to accurately judge the size of their
      drinks, underestimating the number of fluid ounces by about 30%. Although the
      vessels methodology used here must be refined and tested further on other
      populations (e.g., men, nonpregnant women, and all ethnic groups), results
      suggest that determination of risk levels should be based on survey data that
      takes into consideration the beverage mix and the actual size of respondents'
      alcohol drinks.

TI  - Brain dysmorphology in individuals with severe prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 148-54
AB  - Our previous studies revealed abnormalities on structural MRI (sMRI) in small
      groups of children exposed to alcohol prenatally. Microcephaly,
      disproportionately reduced basal ganglia volume, and abnormalities of the
      cerebellar vermis and corpus callosum were demonstrated. The present study used
      sMRI to examine in detail the regional pattern of brain hypoplasia resulting from
      prenatal exposure to alcohol using a higher resolution imaging protocol and
      larger sample sizes than reported previously. Fourteen participants (mean 11.4
      years; eight females, six males) with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 12
      participants (mean 14.8 years; four females, eight males) with prenatal exposure 
      to alcohol (PEA) but without the facial features of FAS were compared to a group 
      of 41 control participants (mean 12.8 years, 20 females, 21 males). Findings of
      significant microcephaly and disproportionately reduced basal ganglia volumes in 
      the FAS group were confirmed. Novel findings were that in FAS participants, white
      matter volumes were more affected than gray matter volumes in the cerebrum, and
      parietal lobes were more affected than temporal and occipital lobes. Among
      subcortical structures, in contrast to the disproportionate effects on caudate
      nucleus, the hippocampus was relatively preserved in FAS participants.
      Differences between the PEA group and controls were generally non-significant;
      however, among a few of the structures most affected in FAS participants, there
      was some evidence for volume reduction in PEA participants as well, specifically 
      in basal ganglia and the parietal lobe. There were no group differences in
      cerebral volume asymmetries. Severe prenatal alcohol exposure appears to produce 
      a specific pattern of brain hypoplasia.

TI  - An analysis of the teratagenic effects that could possibly be due to alcohol
      consumption by pregnant mothers.
PG  - 425-31
AB  - It can be concluded that alcohol is definitely harmful to the developing fetus.
      The effect can manifest in various ways, the most extreme of which is a condition
      called Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). The diagnosis of maternal alcoholism leading
      onto cases of FAS is difficult due to absence of accurate diagnostic tests. The
      diagnosis of FAS in a child is easier by a proper examination. There is no
      specific treatment of FAS in a child. The only management is by institution of
      corrective and rehabilitative measures. The exact mechanism of the teratogenic
      action of alcohol is not known. It is probably due to the harmful effect of
      alcohol on the epiblast layer of the bilaminar germ disc. In the absence of
      adequate knowledge regarding FAS, not much can be done to remedy the deleterious 
      effects of alcohol. Hence, a word of advice to all pregnant women is to avoid
      drinking during pregnancy.

TI  - Measuring the facial phenotype of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure:
      correlations with brain dysfunction.
PG  - 147-59
AB  - The purpose of this report is to demonstrate how to measure the magnitude of
      expression of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) facial phenotype using the new
      4-Digit Diagnostic Code and the previously developed D-score and to demonstrate
      how these two measures of the FAS facial phenotype correlate with brain function 
      and structure; correlations that fail to be identified by the older gestalt
      method of facial measurement. The D-score and the facial component of the 4-Digit
      Diagnostic Code quantitatively measure the magnitude of expression of the FAS
      facial phenotype using three facial features (palpebral fissure length, philtrum 
      smoothness, and upper lip thinness). These facial measurement systems were
      developed by the Washington State FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN)
      of clinics and are used to screen and diagnose the facial component of FAS for
      all patients evaluated in the network of clinics (1500 to date). The 4-Digit
      Diagnostic Code is a comprehensive diagnostic system developed by the FAS DPN in 
      1997 to diagnose the full spectrum of outcomes among patients with prenatal
      alcohol exposure. The four digits reflect the magnitude of expression of the four
      key diagnostic features of FAS in the following order: (1) growth deficiency; (2)
      the FAS facial phenotype; (3) brain dysfunction; (4) gestational alcohol
      exposure. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code was developed to overcome the subjective,
      highly variable gestalt method of diagnosis that has been used as the standard to
      date, worldwide. Prior to the development of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the
      first 445 patients evaluated in the FAS DPN were diagnosed using the gestalt
      method. For research purposes, their gestalt diagnoses were transformed into
      4-Digit Diagnostic Codes, presenting a unique opportunity to directly compare the
      two diagnostic methods. When the facial phenotype was measured using the 4-Digit 
      Diagnostic Code or D-score, the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial
      phenotype was significantly correlated with structural, neurologic, and
      functional measures of brain damage, and the phenotype of those receiving a
      4-Digit Diagnosis of FAS showed little variability. When the gestalt method of
      diagnosis was used, the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype did
      not correlate with structural, neurologic and functional measures of brain
      damage, and the facial phenotype of those receiving a gestalt diagnosis of FAS
      was highly variable. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and D-score thus provide more
      precise and accurate measures of the FAS facial phenotype and reveal important
      correlations with brain structure and function, suggesting that intermediate
      expressions of the FAS facial phenotype may serve as important risk factors for
      brain damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure.

TI  - Gin Lane: did Hogarth know about fetal alcohol syndrome?
PG  - 131-4
AB  - Medical historians have searched for evidence that the characteristics of fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS) were recognized long before its modern description in
      1973. This search has often focused on the 'gin epidemic' in 18th century London,
      and especially William Hogarth's Gin Lane, which some authors allege reflects an 
      awareness of the facial characteristics of the syndrome. While the 'gin epidemic'
      undoubtedly resulted in the increased birth of weak and sickly children, claims
      about Hogarth's awareness of the stigmata of the FAS are unfounded. The birth of 
      weak and sickly children, and the high infant mortality rates associated with
      this period, long preceded the 'gin epidemic' and were primarily due to disease, 
      starvation, exposure, and deliberate infanticide.

AB  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, of
      which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most devastating. Recognizable by
      characteristic craniofacial abnormalities and growth deficiency, this condition
      includes severe alcohol-induced damage to the developing brain. FAS children
      experience deficits in intellectual functioning; difficulties in learning,
      memory, problem-solving, and attention; and difficulties with mental health and
      social interactions. An FAS diagnosis, however, fails to identify
      prenatal-alcohol-exposed children who lack the characteristic facial defects and 
      growth deficiency of FAS. Nonetheless, these often undiagnosed children may still
      experience serious fetal alcohol effects (FAE), including alcohol-induced mental 
      impairments (i.e., alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorder) or alcohol-related 
      abnormalities of the skeleton and certain organ systems (i.e., alcohol-related
      birth defects). Neuroimaging techniques can assist researchers in identifying FAE
      through precise pictures of brain abnormalities in persons prenatally exposed to 
      alcohol. By understanding the mechanisms underlying FAE and the behavioral
      manifestations of the resulting structural brain damage, researchers can
      ultimately develop effective FAS prevention strategies that identify and assist
      high-risk women at varying levels of pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study determined the characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome
      in a South African community, and methodology was designed for the
      multidisciplinary study of fetal alcohol syndrome in developing societies.
      METHODS: An active case ascertainment, 2-tier methodology was used among 992
      first-grade pupils. A case-control design, using measures of growth, development,
      dysmorphology, and maternal risk, delineated characteristics of children with
      fetal alcohol syndrome. RESULTS: A high rate of fetal alcohol syndrome was found 
      in the schools--40.5 to 46.4 per 1000 children aged 5 to 9 years--and
      age-specific community rates (ages 6-7) were 39.2 to 42.9. These rates are 18 to 
      141 times greater than in the United States. Rural residents had significantly
      more fetal alcohol syndrome. After control for ethnic variation, children with
      fetal alcohol syndrome had traits similar to those elsewhere: poor growth and
      development, congruent dysmorphology, and lower intellectual functioning.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study documented the highest fetal alcohol syndrome rate to
      date in an overall community population. Fetal alcohol syndrome initiatives that 
      incorporate innovative sampling and active case ascertainment methods can be used
      to obtain timely and accurate data among developing populations.

TI  - Clinical and electroretinographic findings in fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 200-4
AB  - PURPOSE: Fetal exposure to alcohol is a serious public health problem and is
      associated with anomalies of the eye ground, as well as neurodevelopmental delay,
      growth delay, and characteristic facial features. Our purpose is to report the
      incidence of abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) results in children with fetal
      alcohol syndrome and raise awareness of the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome
      in ophthalmology. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on the records of
      11 children with the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. The results of the
      ophthalmologic examination, magnetic resonance imaging, visual acuity test, and
      ERG are reported. RESULTS: The magnetic resonance imaging results were abnormal
      in all subjects tested. The ophthalmology examination showed optic nerve
      hypoplasia in 91% of the subjects. Visual acuity was reduced in all but one
      subject. The ERG results were abnormal, showing reduced b-wave amplitude,
      increased a- and b-wave implicit time, reduced Rmax, and increased log (k). The
      scotopic ERG was more severely affected than the photopic ERG. CONCLUSIONS:
      Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to changes in retinal function as evidenced by
      an abnormal ERG response. The ERG can therefore be a tool with which to identify 
      suspected alcohol embryopathy.

TI  - Reducing complications from alcohol use during pregnancy through screening.
PG  - 225-7, 240
AB  - Prenatal providers are reluctant to discuss alcohol use in the clinical setting, 
      even though heavy alcohol use is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and
      fetal alcohol effects (FAE), sometimes known as alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorder. Fourteen percent to 20% of pregnant women report
      drinking some alcohol during pregnancy. Approximately 0.2% to 1% meet the
      criteria for heavy drinking. Reducing drinking during pregnancy has the potential
      to reduce the risk for FAS and FAE. Routine screening for alcohol use during
      pregnancy followed by referrals for those considered to be at risk is
      recommended. Women are often more receptive to intervention during pregnancy, as 
      they focus on positive health behaviors. A number of brief screening tools
      designed for use on a routine basis are reviewed. Physicians who learn to
      comfortably discuss alcohol use during pregnancy can help substantially reduce
      the impact of these disorders.

TI  - Early identification of risk for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 607-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and less severe outcomes are typically
      diagnosed later in childhood, although earlier diagnosis of the effects of
      exposure would allow intervention in infancy and prevention of associated
      secondary disabilities. Identification is particularly difficult in such
      high-risk groups as low-birthweight infants. The goal of this study was to
      develop methods for early identification of at-risk infants. METHOD: Three
      methods (microcephaly, heavy episodic drinking [> 5 drinks/occasion] in pregnancy
      and a cumulative risk index) identified neonates at risk for those developmental 
      consequences of prenatal exposure that can be measured at 6 and 12 months (i.e., 
      standard scores on Bayley Scales of Infant Development and growth measures). The 
      usefulness of these methods was assessed by comparing those infants selected to
      an unexposed contrast group, while controlling for potentially confounding
      factors (e.g., race, socioeconomic status and birthweight). RESULTS: At 6 months,
      when 70 infants were tested, trends were found for lower language facet scores
      and lower scores on the Behavioral Regulation Scale; at 12 months, when 134 were 
      tested, alcohol-exposed infants had significantly lower cognitive facet scores (p
      < .02) and were more likely to be classified as either mildly or significantly
      developmentally delayed (p < .02). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to identify
      infants at risk for alcohol-related developmental delays using information
      available in the neonatal period, although it is not usually done. Of the three
      methods tested, a cumulative risk index based on maternal characteristics was
      found to be most predictive.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is one of the leading preventable causes of birth
      defects, mental retardation, and neurodevelopmental disorders. In 1973, a cluster
      of birth defects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure was recognized as a
      clinical entity called fetal alcohol syndrome. More recently, alcohol exposure in
      utero has been linked to a variety of other neurodevelopmental problems, and the 
      terms alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth
      defects have been proposed to identify infants so affected. This statement is an 
      update of a previous statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics and reflects
      the current thinking about alcohol exposure in utero and the revised nosology.

TI  - Twelve-year follow-up of children exposed to alcohol in utero.
PG  - 406-11
AB  - Eighty-two women who were consuming alcohol while pregnant attended a special
      clinic at the University Central Hospital, Helsinki with the aim of reducing
      heavy drinking during pregnancy. The children born to these women were followed
      up regularly. During their preschool years the children were assessed to have
      fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental
      disorder, pre- and/or postnatal growth retardation, or they were assessed to have
      normal cognitive and somatic growth. Of the original children, 70 of 82 could be 
      traced at the age of 12 years. Through semistructured interview and contact with 
      the health and social care authorities, information was gathered about schooling,
      family structure, whether help had been sought for behavioural difficulties and
      major adverse events in the family. The longer the intrauterine alcohol exposure 
      and the more severe the diagnosis related to prenatal alcohol exposure, the more 
      often the children required special education, were temporarily or permanently
      taken into care, and had behavioural problems. There is a considerable need for
      prolonged multidisciplinary follow-up and support of all children whose mothers
      have not been able to reduce drinking in early pregnancy, whether or not
      cognitive disturbances are evident in early childhood.

PG  - 365-9
AB  - About 20% of pregnant women will drink alcohol, even though no universally safe
      level of prenatal alcohol consumption has been established. This study of 123
      alcohol screen-positive pregnant women receiving a brief intervention in the 16th
      week of gestation examines the relationship of drinking goals, reasons for the
      goals, recognition of situations increasing risk of drinking, and subsequent
      antepartum consumption. While women who named abstinence as their antepartum
      drinking goal were more likely not to be consuming alcohol at the time of study
      enrollment (chi(2) = 16.80, df = 1, p =.001), current drinkers who named
      abstinence as their goal did reduce subsequent prenatal alcohol use (chi(2) =
      10.04, df = 1, p =.002). All current drinkers who indicated fetal alcohol
      syndrome as a reason not to drink reduced their subsequent alcohol consumption
      (chi(2) = 11.04, df = 1, p =.001). Future efforts may include the partners and
      support systems of pregnant women in education or intervention programs to reduce
      prenatal alcohol consumption to enhance their effectiveness.

TI  - A survey of obstetrician-gynecologists on their patients' alcohol use during
      pregnancy.
PG  - 756-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine knowledge, attitudes, current clinical practices, and
      educational needs of obstetrician-gynecologists regarding patients' alcohol use
      during pregnancy. METHODS: A 20-item, self-administered questionnaire on
      patients' prenatal alcohol use was sent to 1000 active ACOG fellows. Responses
      were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. RESULTS: 
      Of the 60% of the obstetrician-gynecologists who responded to the survey, 97%
      reported asking their pregnant patients about alcohol use. When a patient reports
      alcohol use, most respondents reported that they always discuss adverse effects
      and always advise abstinence. One fifth of the respondents (20%) reported
      abstinence to be the safest way to avoid all four of the adverse pregnancy
      outcomes cited (ie, spontaneous abortion, central nervous system impairment,
      birth defects, and fetal alcohol syndrome); 13% were unsure about levels
      associated with all of the adverse outcomes; and 4% reported that consumption of 
      eight or more drinks per week did not pose a risk for any of the four adverse
      outcomes. The two resources that respondents said they needed most to improve
      alcohol-use assessment were information on thresholds for adverse reproductive
      outcomes (83%) and referral resources for patients with alcohol problems (63%).
      CONCLUSION: Efforts should be made to provide practicing
      obstetrician-gynecologists with updates on the adverse effects of alcohol use by 
      pregnant women and with effective methods for screening and counseling women who 
      report alcohol use during pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare two prenatal alcohol use screening instruments with a
      physiologic measure of prenatal alcohol use. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of 
      the Prenatal Alcohol Use Interview (PAUI) and the ACOG Antepartum Record with
      CDTect. SETTING: An inner-city, high-volume, prenatal clinic. PARTICIPANTS:
      Fifty-six women selected and enrolled at their first prenatal visits. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: An assessment of relative sensitivity and specificity of two
      prenatal alcohol use screening instruments. RESULTS: Women identified as Drinkers
      by the CDTect were more likely to be identified as Drinkers by the PAUI (59%)
      than by the ACOG Antepartum Record (19%). Also, the PAUI had a lower false
      negative rate (41%) than the ACOG record (80%). That is, the PAUI was less likely
      to identify as Quitters women the CDTect identified as Drinkers than was the ACOG
      record. CONCLUSION: The PAUI is a more sensitive screen than the ACOG record and 
      should be the instrument preferred for screening prenatal alcohol use.

TI  - Exposure to alcohol in utero: Influence on cognitive function and learning in a
      northern elementary school population.
PG  - 93-100
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence of fetal alcohol exposure; to compare
      physical, behavioural and learning patterns of children with significant alcohol 
      exposure in utero with those of a group of children exposed to minimal alcohol;
      to assess the usefulness of a fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/fetal alcohol effect
      (FAE) score; and to provide feedback to parents, schools and communities. DESIGN:
      Parent questionnaire, complete physical examinations of children, psychometric
      tests of the children using elements of the Pediatric Early Elementary
      Examination (PEEX) and the Pediatric Examination of Educational Readiness (PEER),
      ADD-H comprehensive teachers rating scale (ACTeRS) score, the newly developed
      FAS/FAE Score, and the Brigance Comprehensive Inventory of Basic Skills to assess
      language and mathematical achievement. Testers were blinded to the results of the
      assessments and questionnaires. SETTING: Grades 1 to 3 at Sir Alexander MacKenzie
      School in Inuvik, Northwest Territories. RESULTS: Twenty-four per cent of mothers
      reported frequent or binge drinking, and 76% of mothers reported abstinence or
      moderate alcohol intake. There were significant ethnic differences; none of the
      Caucasian mothers reported frequent or binge drinking during pregnancy compared
      with 40% of Inuvialuit and 33% of Indian mothers. Children with exposure to
      frequent or binge drinking in utero had smaller palpebral fissures (2.3+/-0.1 cm 
      versus 2.5+/-0.3 cm, P<0.01), smaller palpebral fissure to intercanthal distance 
      ratios (0.77+/-0.05 versus 0.86+/-0.10, P<0.01) and smaller head circumferences
      (52.1+/-1.6 cm versus 53.6+/-1.6 cm, P<0.01) than those exposed to moderate
      drinking or abstinence. Children exposed to frequent or binge drinking in utero
      also demonstrated poorer coordination (P<0.005) and cortical function (P<0.01),
      attention problems, hyperactivity (ACTeRS), and poorer scholastic achievement in 
      language (P<0.001) and mathematics (P<0.01) than their minimally exposed
      counterparts. In children in grades 2 and 3, a significant negative correlation
      was found between FAS/FAE scores and language (r=-0.55, P<0.001) and mathematical
      achievement (r=-0.28, P=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of drinking during
      pregnancy in the northern population studied was high, and exposure in utero was 
      associated with physical abnormalities, difficulties with coordination and
      cortical function, and significant delays in language and mathematical
      achievement. The FAS/FAE score may be useful in predicting success or failure in 
      language development.

TI  - Was the fetal alcohol syndrome recognized by the Greeks and Romans?
PG  - 868-72
AB  - Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers/scientists are frequently quoted as
      expressing an awareness of potential harm associated with drinking during
      pregnancy. However, the statements attributed to these authors were not made by
      them. Instead, they are interpretations, presented in the form of verbatim
      statements, of their views relating to procreation. Although they did have
      something to say about the role of alcohol in procreation, it was the effects of 
      drinking on the male body at the time of conception, and especially alcohol's
      effects on male body temperature, that concerned them. A cold body at the time of
      conception was believed to enhance the likelihood of conceiving a female, which
      to the Greeks and Romans was a 'deformity'.

TI  - Effects of gestational alcohol exposure on the fatty acid composition of
      umbilical cord serum in humans.
PG  - 300S-6S
AB  - This study examined the effects of maternal periconceptional alcohol intake on
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations in human neonates. The area
      percentage of each fatty acid in cord blood serum from 12 infants born to control
      women (who consumed <2 mL absolute ethanol/d) was compared with that of 9 infants
      born to women whose periconceptional alcohol intake averaged > or = 30mL absolute
      ethanol/d. Periconceptional alcohol use was associated with a 30% increase in the
      proportion of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) in cord blood (3.0% of total lipid
      in control infants compared with 3.9% in alcohol-exposed infants; P < 0.01). The 
      rise in the proportion of 22:6n-3 was responsible for increases in the ratio of
      n-3 to n-6 fatty acids and the ratio of long-chain n-3 to n-6 fatty acids (P <
      0.055). Examination of the lipid-class fatty acid profile indicated that serum
      lipid alterations were localized to the cholesterol esters; 22:6n-3 in the
      cholesterol esters of alcohol-exposed infants increased 54% (P < 0.011) and
      arachidonic acid increased 55% (P < 0. 005). The relative fatty acyl composition 
      of maternal serum showed a significant increase in 18:0 fatty acids in the
      alcohol-exposed group (25%, P < 0.005) but there were no changes in the other
      fatty acids. The increase in the proportion of 22:6n-3 was unexpected but is
      consistent with the hypothesis that this essential lipid may be conserved
      selectively. These results imply that the lifelong neurobehavioral and sensory
      dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorders may be due in part to PUFA dysregulation.

TI  - Optic nerve morphology may reveal adverse events during prenatal and perinatal
      life--digital image analysis.
PG  - S63-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate optic nerve morphology in children with various conditions
      caused by adverse events during prenatal and/or perinatal life and to investigate
      whether optic nerve morphology can reveal brain lesions associated with these
      conditions, as well as provide insight into the etiology and timing of the
      prenatal and perinatal damage. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A digital image analysis
      technique was used to analyze fundus photographs. One hundred healthy Swedish
      individuals of various ages from childhood to adolescence constituted a reference
      group. The following patient groups were chosen to represent various clinical
      conditions affecting the newborn or fetus at different stages of development:
      children born preterm (N = 39), children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS [N =
      16]), children with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL [N = 17]), and children
      with septo-optic dysplasia (SOD [N = 6]). RESULTS: Preterm children without known
      brain lesions demonstrated normal optic disk morphology but abnormal retinal
      vascular pattern; children born preterm with an acquired brain lesion late in
      gestation (PVL) demonstrated normal disk size with enlarged cups in addition to
      the abnormal vascular pattern. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (FAS) had 
      a subnormal optic disk area with increased tortuosity of both arteries and veins,
      whereas children born at term with an early acquired brain lesion (SOD) had a
      markedly reduced optic disk area with isolated tortuosity of the retinal veins.
      CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of optic nerve morphology, by digital image analysis,
      demonstrated that differences in ocular fundus morphology were correlated with
      differences in etiology and timing of the adverse event occurring in prenatal and
      perinatal life. In addition, digital image analysis may be a helpful tool for
      understanding variations in optic nerve and retinal vessel morphology and their
      relationship with central nervous pathology.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 678-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) describes the systemic and ocular
      anomalies resulting from the teratogenic effect of maternal alcohol abuse during 
      pregnancy. It is a leading cause of preventable birth defects in the U.S. CASE
      REPORTS: Two case reports illustrate the characteristic findings in FAS. These
      include growth retardation, cognitive impairment, and facial dysmorphism. Ocular 
      signs are prevalent, including small palpebral fissure, microcornea, strabismus, 
      myopia, astigmatism, and optic nerve hypoplasia. DISCUSSION: Fetal alcohol
      exposure can lead to a wide spectrum of systemic defects and vision deficits. The
      increasing frequency of drinking among pregnant women in recent years should call
      more public attention to this detrimental yet preventable syndrome. CONCLUSION:
      The high frequency of ocular manifestations aids in making a diagnosis of FAS,
      which can be challenging. Eye-care professionals can play an important role in
      patient management and the educational process.

TI  - Alcohol use prior to pregnancy recognition.
PG  - 101-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frequent alcohol use during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy can result
      in spontaneous abortion and dysmorphologic changes in the developing organ
      systems of the embryo, including the heart, kidneys, and brain. However, few
      population-based studies are available that describe the prevalence of frequent
      drinking (6 or more drinks per week) among women prior to and during early
      pregnancy (the periconceptional period), and the sociodemographic and behavioral 
      factors that characterize these women. Such knowledge is fundamental to the
      design of targeted interventions for the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS) and other prenatal alcohol-related disorders. METHODS: This cross-sectional
      study used survey data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics as 
      part of the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS). Weighted
      prevalence estimates were calculated using SUDAAN, and multivariate analyses were
      used to determine risk factors for frequent drinking. RESULTS: Forty-five percent
      of all women surveyed reported consuming alcohol during the 3 months before
      finding out they were pregnant, and 5% reported consuming 6 or more drinks per
      week. Sixty percent of women who reported alcohol consumption also reported that 
      they did not learn they were pregnant until after the fourth week of gestation.
      Risk factors for frequent drinking during the periconceptional period included 1 
      or more of the following: being unmarried, being a smoker, being white
      non-Hispanic, being 25 years of age or older, or being college educated.
      CONCLUSIONS: Half of all pregnant women in this study drank alcohol during the 3 
      months preceding pregnancy recognition, with 1 in 20 drinking at moderate to
      heavy levels. The majority did not know they were pregnant until after the fourth
      week of pregnancy, and many did not know until after the 6th week. Alcohol is a
      teratogen capable of producing a number of adverse reproductive and infant
      outcomes. Public health measures needed to reduce these potentially harmful
      exposures include alcohol assessment, education, and counseling for women of
      childbearing age, with referral sources for problem drinking, and family planning
      services for pregnancy postponement until problem drinking is resolved.

TI  - Individual differences in auditory and visual attention among fetal
      alcohol-affected adults.
PG  - 1395-402
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficits in attention are commonly identified among patients who have
      been prenatally exposed to alcohol, and they often affect the ability of the
      patients to function appropriately in society. METHODS: Eleven adult patients
      with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) were compared
      with nine adult subjects with no history of prenatal alcohol exposure, using four
      tests of visually and auditorially mediated attention. RESULTS: In relation to
      the comparison group, patients with FAS/FAE exhibited substantial deficits in
      both auditory and visual attention; the auditory deficits were greater. We
      observed two predominant patterns of deficits among patients with FAS/FAE, one
      involving both auditory and visual attention problems and the other involving
      less severe auditory problems and even fewer visual problems. Most subjects with 
      FAS or FAE had some manifestations of attention problems in at least one of the
      tests of attention used in this study. We present a new graphical representation 
      of individual auditory Continuous Performance Test data across a 6-min period,
      which, compared with conventional scores, more clearly reveals the markedly
      disrupted and variable attention patterns displayed by some individuals with FAS 
      or FAE. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that detailed analysis of the pattern
      of individual performance for each subject is an important aspect of Continuous
      Performance Test assessment. Our findings further suggest that intellectual
      performance (intelligence quotient score) alone is not sufficient to account for 
      the patterns of disrupted attention for individuals with FAS/FAE. Assessment of
      individuals with FAS or FAE should include measurement of attentional functioning
      in both the visual and auditory modalities.

TI  - Implicit and explicit memory functioning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol 
      exposure.
PG  - 462-71
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with widespread and devastating
      neurodevelopmental deficits. Numerous reports have suggested memory deficits in
      both humans and animals exposed prenatally to alcohol. However, the nature of
      these memory deficits remains to be characterized. Recently children with fetal
      alcohol syndrome were shown to have learning and memory deficits on a verbal
      learning and memory measure that involved free recall and recognition memory. The
      current study seeks to further characterize memory functioning in children with
      heavy prenatal alcohol exposure by evaluating priming performance. The choice of 
      task is also relevant given previous studies of memory performance in patient
      groups with and without involvement of the basal ganglia, a group of structures
      known to be affected in fetal alcohol syndrome. Three groups were evaluated for
      lexical priming, free recall, recognition memory, and verbal fluency: (1)
      children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure; (2) children with Down syndrome;
      and (3) nonexposed controls. The children with Down syndrome showed significantly
      less priming than alcohol-exposed children, who did not differ from controls. In 
      addition, the alcohol-exposed children were impaired on the free recall task but 
      not on the recognition memory task, whereas the children with Down syndrome
      performed significantly worse than the alcohol-exposed group on both tasks.
      Finally, on the verbal fluency task, children with heavy prenatal alcohol
      exposure were impaired on both category and letter fluency, but the degree of
      impairment was greater for letter fluency. These results further characterize the
      memory deficits in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure suggesting that 
      in spite of learning and memory deficits, they are able to benefit from priming
      of verbal information.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in dermatology: an overview and an evaluation.
PG  - 341-5
AB  - Certain skin disorders are affected by alcohol abuse. Maternal alcohol abuse
      during pregnancy also gives rise to a typical malformation pattern in the child
      with a varying degree of severity (grade I-III). The diagnosis of fetal alcohol
      syndrome (FAS) is based on the detailed history of the maternal alcohol
      consumption in combination with the clinical, morphological, intellectual and
      psychosocial development of the child. The behavior of the child is also of
      diagnostic value. The grade of severity of the FAS can be determined during the
      first three years of life on the basis of a scoring system. In addition to
      medical care and surgical treatment of associated disorders, early support for
      the mental development of the child is of immense importance. Furthermore, the
      medical, social and psychological care of the mother must be considered. In the
      field of dermatology, knowledge about the pathomechanism of FAS is also important
      for its prevention in unborn children. Women of childbearing age presenting with 
      dermatological signs of possible alcohol abuse, should alert the dermatologist to
      the possible risk to the child of FAS. Familiarity with FAS and the ability to
      recognise its clinical features are important for the adequate treatment and
      support of the affected child and for the mother suffering from alcohol disease, 
      in cooperation with other treating doctors.

TI  - [Motherhood and fatherhood after liver transplantation].
PG  - 715-20
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Liver transplantation for terminal liver failure
      enables patients to look forward to many years of good quality life. As a result,
      more and more of the often still relatively young transplant recipients inquire
      about the possible risks to a child procreated after transplantation. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: During 9.5 years (between September 1988 and April 1998) 1000 liver 
      transplantations were performed on 911 patients (374 females, 537 males) at our
      hospital. The potential for parenthood existed for 163 women (aged between 16 an 
      46 years) and 520 men. 14 children were born of 14 women, six pregnancies ended
      in spontaneous abortion or miscarriage and three other women are now pregnant.
      Seven men reported paternity of eight children after transplantation. All data
      were collected prospectively. RESULTS: Six of the 14 births (42.9%) proceeded
      normally, but up to three complications developed in the other eight (57.1%). Six
      women (35.7%) developed hypertension during the pregnancy. There was no case of
      transplant dysfunction or toxaemia of pregnancy. Half the births were by
      caesarean section. Premature births occurred in two women (14.3%); four children 
      were underweight (< 2500 g) at birth (28.6%). The seven men, at a mean age of 44 
      (7-75) months after transplantation, fathered eight children, at present aged
      between 11 months and 6 years, all of whom have developed normally. The 13
      children of the post-transplantation mothers are also without malformation or
      abnormal development. One child's development is retarded due to a fetal alcohol 
      syndrome resulting from the mother's post-transplantation alcohol abuse during
      pregnancy. All the patients are well at present and live with their children.
      CONCLUSIONS: Both men and women can procreate at a relatively low risk to the
      off-spring. But for this to happen, an informed decision for parenthood must be
      made by the prospective parent together with her/his partner and the doctor in
      charge, she/he must be in good physical condition with stable transplant
      function, and there must be frequent interdisciplinary monitoring during any
      post-transplantation pregnancy.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol use and offspring size at 10 years of age.
PG  - 863-9
AB  - The Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project is a longitudinal
      study of the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol and other substances. Women 
      were selected from a prenatal clinic and interviewed at the 4th and 7th months of
      pregnancy. Their offspring were examined at delivery, at 8 and 18 months, and at 
      3, 6, and 10 years. This report examined 610 offspring, at age 10, who were
      exposed prenatally to alcohol. Most alcohol use in this low-income cohort was
      light to moderate, although the entire spectrum of alcohol use is represented.
      The weight, length, head circumference, and skinfold thickness of the offspring
      were measured. At each assessment phase, we found a significant association
      between size and prenatal exposure to alcohol. At age 10, the children who were
      prenatally exposed to alcohol continued to be significantly smaller in weight,
      height, head circumference, and skinfold thickness. These results indicate that
      prenatal alcohol exposure has a long-term impact on offspring growth.

TI  - Validation of a self-administered questionnaire to screen for prenatal alcohol
      use in Northern Plains Indian women.
PG  - 240-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study among American Indian prenatal patients was conducted to
      validate a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) designed to (1) identify women
      who had consumed alcohol during pregnancy, (2) identify women who may be at risk 
      of drinking during pregnancy, and (3) determine the quantity and frequency of
      alcohol and other substance use just before and during pregnancy. METHODS: The
      validation involved three components: (1) review of the SAQ responses by a public
      health nurse; (2) structured patient interview with the research nurse; and (3)
      medical record abstraction postpartum. RESULTS: Compared to extensive interview
      and medical record data, the SAQ is sensitive (76.6%) and specific (92.8%) in
      detecting pregnant women who had consumed alcohol during pregnancy. CONCLUSION:
      The SAQ is a useful screening tool for alcohol use in this population.

TI  - Findings of a pilot study of motivational interviewing with pregnant drinkers.
PG  - 285-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cost-effective interventions are needed for counseling pregnant
      drinkers, in order to reduce risk of fetal alcohol effects. METHOD: 42 pregnant
      women who reported alcohol consumption participated in this pilot study of
      motivational interviewing. Following a comprehensive alcohol use assessment, the 
      participants were randomly assigned to receive either written information about
      the risks related to drinking during pregnancy or a one-hour motivational
      interview. The motivational interview was an empathic, client-centered, but
      directive session focusing on the health of the participants' unborn babies.
      RESULTS: At the end of a 2-month follow-up period, the 34 women (81%) who
      remained in the study showed a significant reduction in alcohol consumption and
      peak intoxication levels. Women who had reported the highest blood alcohol
      concentration (BAC) levels during early pregnancy showed a significantly greater 
      reduction in their estimated BACs at follow-up (during later pregnancy) if
      assigned to the treatment rather than the control condition. CONCLUSIONS:
      Motivational interviewing shows promise as a specific intervention for initiating
      a reduction in drinking among pregnant women who are at greatest risk. Simpler
      assessment and advice may suffice for women with lower initial consumption
      levels.

      review.]
PG  - 130-144
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can have devastating consequences for the unborn child.
      The physical malformations and growth retardation characteristic of the fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS) only represent the tip of the teratological iceberg. The
      functional impairments that are not obvious to the eye have the most detrimental 
      consequences for the individual. The cognitive and behavioral problems seen in
      alcoholexposed children are caused by alterations in brain function and/or
      structure. The extent of damage to the brain is time and dose related. Fetal
      alcohol syndrome and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) have been
      estimated to affect as many as 9.1 children per 1,000 according to a prospective 
      study in Seattle, USA. Long-term outcome reveals an excess of social and mental
      problems. The incidence of FAS and ARND in Icelandic children is unknown. Various
      research outcomes and implications for therapy are discussed.

TI  - What do physicians know and say about fetal alcohol syndrome: a survey of
      obstetricians, pediatricians, and family medicine physicians.
PG  - 1951-4
AB  - Pediatricians, obstetricians, and family practice physicians in Michigan were
      surveyed by mail for their knowledge and opinions about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
      (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE). Physicians said that about 67% of their
      patients raised questions about drinking during pregnancy but only 2%
      specifically referred to FAS or FAE. Most physicians were uncertain about whether
      their colleagues were sufficiently aware of FAS, whether FAS could be diagnosed
      at birth, or if physicians were acquainted with the syndrome's major criteria.
      However, most believed FAS was not being overdiagnosed and believed that making a
      diagnosis of FAS at birth could lead to improved treatment of an affected child. 
      Physicians also believed that physician counseling was a more effective way of
      reducing the incidence of FAS/FAE than warning labels. Forty-one percent of the
      physicians placed the threshold for FAS at one to three drinks per day and 38%
      placed the threshold at one or fewer drinks a day. Thirty-five percent placed the
      estimated incidence of FAS at 1 to 2 per 1000 in the United States. We conclude
      that physicians are in relative agreement about the effects of drinking during
      pregnancy and the value of physician counseling but are misguided as to what
      constitutes a true risk level of drinking as far as the etiology of FAS is
      concerned.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: maternal and neonatal characteristics.
PG  - 263-9
AB  - Alcohol is the most common identifiable teratogenic cause of mental retardation
      in North America. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a major public health problem, 
      which is frequently under diagnosed by physicians. OBJECTIVE: To identify and
      quantify the maternal risk factors and neonatal characteristics of children with 
      FAS. DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study using birth certificate data of
      North Dakota children diagnosed with FAS. Five controls were selected for each
      patient. Controls were selected from the computerized birth registry and matched 
      by gender, year and month of birth. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: A list of all the
      children diagnosed with FAS from the North Dakota FAS Registry was sent to the
      State Health Department. We were able to locate the birth certificates for 132
      (56%) of the 228 cases on the registry. RESULTS: Of the 132 FAS cases, 106
      (80.3%) were Native Americans and 24 (18.2%) were Caucasians. In this sample 51
      (38.6%) of the cases were male and 81 (61.4%) were female. Statistically
      significant maternal characteristics at p < 0.01 were: older mother's age, lower 
      education level, fewer months of prenatal care, fewer prenatal visits, lower
      gestational age at time of delivery and less prenatal weight gain. Significant
      neonatal differences at p < 0.01 were lower birth weight and Apgar scores and
      higher incidence of congenital malformations. CONCLUSION: FAS is a completely
      preventable developmental disability. Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can
      result in lifelong physical and mental impairments on the fetus. All pregnant
      women should be screened for alcohol use during prenatal visits. Women with
      positive screens or at high risk should be identified early by the primary care
      physician and referred for treatment and counseling.

TI  - Identification of children with fetal alcohol syndrome and opportunity for
      referral of their mothers for primary prevention--Washington, 1993-1997.
PG  - 861-4
AB  - Heavy maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy can cause permanent birth defects,
      including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Although these alcohol-related defects
      are entirely preventable, the factors associated with maternal use of alcohol
      during pregnancy are complex and often resistant to change. In addition, not all 
      women who drink heavily will produce children with FAS. Although targeting
      primary prevention efforts to all women at risk for drinking during pregnancy is 
      ideal, limited resources require targeting women at the highest risk for
      producing children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. One such population is 
      women who have already given birth to an alcohol-affected child. This high-risk
      population is not easily identified because not all children with FAS have their 
      condition diagnosed, and these birth mothers are often separated from their
      children during the first few years of the child's life, often before a diagnosis
      of FAS has been considered. However, once identified, these women are receptive
      to intervention. To identify a population of women at highest risk for a future
      alcohol-exposed pregnancy through diagnosing a previously affected birth child,
      researchers at the University of Washington developed the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome 
      Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN). This report summarizes the results
      of this program and documents the feasibility of identifying persons who may have
      FAS so their condition can be diagnosed and their birth mothers can be identified
      and referred to prevention services.

TI  - Medical risks for women who drink alcohol.
PG  - 627-39
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize for clinicians recent epidemiologic evidence regarding
      medical risks of alcohol use for women. METHODS: MEDLINE and PsychINFO, 1990
      through 1996, were searched using key words "women" or "woman," and "alcohol."
      MEDLINE was also searched for other specific topics and authors from 1980 through
      1996. Data were extracted and reviewed regarding levels of alcohol consumption
      associated with mortality, cardiovascular disease, alcohol-related liver disease,
      injury, osteoporosis, neurologic symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, fetal alcohol
      syndrome, spontaneous abortion, infertility, menstrual symptoms, breast cancer,
      and gynecologic malignancies. Gender-specific data from cohort studies of general
      population or large clinical samples are primarily reviewed. MAIN RESULTS: Women 
      develop many alcohol-related medical problems at lower levels of consumption than
      men, probably reflecting women's lower total body water, gender differences in
      alcohol metabolism, and effects of alcohol on postmenopausal estrogen levels.
      Mortality and breast cancer are increased in women who report drinking more than 
      two drinks daily. Higher levels of alcohol consumption by women are associated
      with increased menstrual symptoms, hypertension, and stroke. Women who drink
      heavily also appear to have increased infertility and spontaneous abortion.
      Adverse fetal effects occur after variable amounts of alcohol consumption, making
      any alcohol use during pregnancy potentially harmful. CONCLUSIONS: In general,
      advising nonpregnant women who drink alcohol to have fewer than two drinks daily 
      is strongly supported by the epidemiologic literature, although specific
      recommendations for a particular woman should depend on her medical history and
      risk factors.

TI  - How do physicians define "light," "moderate," and "heavy" drinking?
PG  - 979-84
AB  - Although widely used, terms associated with consumption of alcohol--such as
      "light," "moderate," and "heavy"--are unstandardized. Physicians conveying health
      messages using these terms therefore may impart confusing information to their
      patients or to other physicians. As an initial attempt to assess if informal
      standardization exists for these terms, the present study surveyed physicians for
      their definitions of such terms. Physicians operationally defined "light"
      drinking as 1.2 drinks/day, "moderate" drinking as 2.2 drinks/day, and "heavy"
      drinking as 3.5 drinks/day. Abusive drinking was defined as 5.4 drinks/day. There
      was considerable agreement for these operational definitions, indicating there is
      indeed an informal consensus among physicians as to what they mean by these
      terms. Gender and age did not influence these definitions, but self-reported
      drinking on the part of physicians was a factor. We also asked physicians for
      their opinions regarding the effects of "light," "moderate," and "heavy" drinking
      on health in general and specifically on health-related implications for pregnant
      women, and whether they felt their patients shared these beliefs.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and family history of alcoholism in the etiology of
      adolescent alcohol problems.
PG  - 533-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative importance of prenatal alcohol exposure and
      family history of alcoholism for the prediction of adolescent alcohol problems.
      METHOD: In 1974-75, a population-based, longitudinal prospective study of alcohol
      and pregnancy began with self-report of alcohol use by pregnant women. In a
      14-year follow-up, 439 parents provided information on the family history of
      alcohol problems for these adolescent offspring. The 14-year-old adolescents
      provided information on the frequency and quantity of their own alcohol
      consumption within the past month, on the consequences of their drinking over the
      past 3 years, and on their age at first intoxication. Additional covariates were 
      assessed prenatally and at follow-up. RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol exposure was more
      predictive of adolescent alcohol use and its negative consequences than was
      family history of alcohol problems. Prenatal exposure retained a significant
      predictive effect even after adjustment for family history and other prenatal and
      environmental covariates. By contrast, the nominally significant correlation of
      family history with adolescent drinking is weaker after adjustment for prenatal
      alcohol exposure and disappears entirely after adjustment for other relevant
      covariates. We observed no evidence for an interactive effect of fetal exposure
      and family history in predicting adolescent alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal
      alcohol exposure is a risk factor for adolescent alcohol involvement and
      alcohol-related problems and may account for variance in prediction of problems
      otherwise attributed to family history of alcoholism. Studies of alcoholism
      etiology and family history need to include consideration of even modest levels
      of fetal alcohol exposure.

TI  - Differences in detection of alcohol use in a prenatal population (on a Northern
      Plains Indian Reservation) using various methods of ascertainment.
PG  - 235-40
AB  - Although Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) rates have been reported to be higher in
      American Indian populations, no screening tool has been validated for alcohol use
      in American Indian women. The objectives of this study were to compare the
      detection of prenatal alcohol use by a self-administered questionnaire to
      detection by clinical interview; and to ascertain whether the screening tool
      would increase detection of pregnant women who are abusing alcohol. The hospital 
      records of the women were reviewed for any history of alcohol-related illnesses
      or injuries to compare with results obtained from the questionnaire. Seventy
      women attending their first prenatal clinic visit on a reservation were screened 
      for alcohol use. There was a wide range in detection of prenatal alcohol use
      (20%-71% of the sample detected) depending on the method used. There was a large 
      variation in sensitivities (7%-93%) of the individual questions in identifying
      patients detected as "high risk" by the clinicians. The T-ACE screening questions
      significantly increased detection of alcohol use compared to detection by the
      clinicians (p = 0.04 Fisher's exact test). Due to the large variation between
      different methods of detection, it is recommended that screening tools that
      increase detection of alcohol use should be combined with methods of higher
      specificity such as using questions about quantity and frequency of alcohol
      intake, medical chart review and clinical interview. We also found that various
      interpretations of the screening questions by the patients highlighted the need
      to tailor the wording of individual questions to the particular patient
      population.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: the 'American Paradox'.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - Nearly all cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) identified in prospective
      epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States of America. The 
      very high incidence rate for FAS in the USA and the relatively low rate in other 
      countries does not correspond to measures of alcohol consumption. By analogy with
      the 'French paradox', we have termed the high rate of FAS in the USA coupled with
      its relatively low level of alcohol consumption, the 'American paradox'.

TI  - Neuropsychological comparison of alcohol-exposed children with or without
      physical features of fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 146-53
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with behavioral and cognitive
      deficits. However, the majority of children born to alcohol-abusing women do not 
      meet the formal criteria for FAS and it is not known if the cognitive abilities
      of these children differ from those of children with FAS. Using a set of
      neuropsychological tests, 3 groups were compared: (a) children with FAS, (b)
      children without FAS who were born to alcohol-abusing women (the PEA group), and 
      (c) normal controls. The results indicated that, relative to controls, both the
      FAS and the PEA groups were impaired on tests of language, verbal learning and
      memory, academic skills, fine-motor speed, and visual-motor integration. These
      data suggest that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a consistent
      pattern of neuropsychological deficits and the degree of these deficits may be
      independent of the presence of physical features associated with FAS.

TI  - Birth weight and congenital anomalies following poisonous mushroom intoxication
      during pregnancy.
PG  - 861-6
AB  - A series of 22 women who suffered from mushroom poisoning while pregnant have
      been identified among adults receiving treatment between 1960 and 1993 in a
      specialist clinic in Budapest, Hungary. In most cases, the poisonings were
      attributed to Amanita phalloides, verna, and related species. Of these, 20 went
      to term, and data were collected on gestational age, birth weight, and both major
      and minor congenital anomalies. Mean birth weight (but not gestational age) was
      lower than in the control series, suggesting that maternal poisoning may have led
      to intrauterine growth retardation. Two children were identified with major
      abnormalities (one of whom had fetal alcohol syndrome related to alcohol abuse by
      the mother). The prevalences of both major and minor anomalies were similar to
      the prevalence in the matched control group and to the rate in a more recent
      control series examined according to the same protocols. However, the statistical
      power to detect teratogenic effects is limited, especially as only five of the
      mothers suffered the poisoning episode during the first trimester.

TI  - Surveillance for fetal alcohol syndrome using multiple sources -- Atlanta,
      Georgia, 1981-1989.
PG  - 1118-20
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by heavy alcohol consumption during
      pregnancy and is characterized by specific anomalies of the face; prenatal and
      postnatal growth deficits; and a variety of central nervous system (CNS)
      abnormalities, including mental retardation. Children with either full or partial
      FAS often incur severe and costly secondary disabilities. Despite the importance 
      of surveillance for establishing the magnitude of FAS and in monitoring trends in
      the occurrence of this disease, population-based surveillance for FAS has been
      difficult because the syndrome can be diagnosed only by clinical observation and 
      often is not recognized until after the child reaches school age. Although most
      FAS surveillance has been based on diagnoses among newborns, most (89%) cases
      (full FAS and partial FAS) are diagnosed after the age of 6 years. To develop a
      more accurate estimate of the prevalence of FAS in a defined population, in 1997 
      CDC linked data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) 
      and the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program
      (MADDSP) for children born in Atlanta during 1981-1989 (the most recent birth
      year for which data were available for 3-10-year-olds). This report presents a
      multiple-source method for FAS surveillance that is more complete than previous
      methods and that enables comparison of rates between states.

TI  - Low-to-moderate gestational alcohol use and intrauterine growth retardation, low 
      birthweight, and preterm delivery.
PG  - 498-508
AB  - PURPOSE: Heavy drinking during pregnancy is an established risk factor for fetal 
      alcohol syndrome and other adverse perinatal outcomes. However, there is still
      debate as to the effects of low-to-moderate drinking during pregnancy. METHODS:
      This prospective investigation was based on 2714 singleton live births at
      Yale-New Haven Hospital during 1988-1992. Alcohol drinking during pregnancy was
      evaluated with respect to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preterm
      delivery, and low birthweight. RESULTS: Mild drinking, defined as > 0.10-0.25 oz 
      of absolute alcohol per day, during the first month of pregnancy was associated
      with a protective effect on IUGR (OR, 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI),
      0.20-0.76). Overall, drinking during month 1 of pregnancy suggested a curvilinear
      effect on growth retardation, with consumption of > 1.00 oz of absolute alcohol
      per day showing increased risk. Drinking during month 7 was associated with a
      uniform increase in the odds of preterm delivery; the ORs were 2.88 (95% CI,
      1.64-5.05) for light drinking and 2.96 (95% CI, 1.32-6.67) for mild-to-moderate
      alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the risk estimates for IUGR and 
      preterm delivery may indicate etiological differences that warrant further
      investigation of these outcomes and critical periods of exposure. Low birthweight
      is not a useful neonatal outcome for this exposure because it is a heterogeneous 
      mix of preterm delivery and IUGR. Despite the observed protective effects of mild
      drinking on IUGR, the increased risk of preterm delivery with alcohol use
      supports a policy of abstinence during pregnancy.

TI  - Alcohol dependence: a critical look at the effects of alcohol metabolism.
PG  - 201-13
AB  - This paper explores the metabolic consequences of alcohol misuse and identifies
      the pathophysiological reasons why alcohol, no matter what quantity is taken
      regularly, is not beneficial for the normal functioning of most body systems.
      Although moderate ethanol consumption may reduce stress and the risk of coronary 
      heart disease, ethanol also exerts a direct toxicological effect because it
      interferes with hepatic metabolism and immune functions. Liver transplantation
      may be necessary for end-stage liver disease in alcoholics. A causal effect
      between alcohol intake and several cancers has been reported. Both environmental 
      and genetic factors are involved in the susceptibility to alcoholism. An
      explanation of alcohol dependence as a family disease is introduced to shed light
      on the magnitude of its collateral effects on the family and on the community as 
      a whole. The adverse effects of alcohol on pregnant women and the fetus are also 
      discussed. To provide awareness of the effectiveness of community efforts, we
      examined the possible intervention strategies and the role of community care in
      this regard.

TI  - Variation in induction of human placental CYP2E1: possible role in susceptibility
      to fetal alcohol syndrome?
PG  - 396-400
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in less than 10% of women who drink heavily during 
      pregnancy. One potential mechanism for this intersubject variation is differences
      in placental alcohol metabolism. Alcohol dehydrogenase is present at low
      concentrations in the placenta and is not inducible. CYP2E1 has not been found in
      human placentas at early gestation time points or in random term placentas.
      Hepatic CYP2E1 is induced by alcohol and other environmental agents, but
      induction varies among heavy drinkers and may be genetically controlled. To test 
      whether CYP2E1 is induced in placenta by heavy drinking during pregnancy, we
      performed a Western blot analysis on placental microsomes from women (n = 8)
      whose periconceptional average daily absolute alcohol intake was greater than 1
      ounce. Using anti-human CYP2E1, bands consistent with CYP2E1 were identified in
      six samples, although considerable variation among individuals was observed.
      Among drinking mothers, offspring head size was smaller among those with
      placental CYP2E1 (p = 0.04). The association between the presence of the protein 
      and smaller birth weight and birth length was equivocal (p = 0.09). Our data are 
      consistent with placental CYP2E1 being inducible by drinking, but with induction 
      being variable among heavy drinking women. We speculate intersubject variation in
      induction may have a genetic basis and may play a role in susceptibility to
      alcohol related defects.

TI  - Alcohol consumption among pregnant and childbearing-aged women--United States,
      1991 and 1995.
PG  - 346-50
AB  - Moderate to heavy alcohol use by women during pregnancy has been associated with 
      many severe adverse effects in their children, including fetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS)--with facial dysmorphology, growth retardation, and central nervous system 
      deficits--and other neurodevelopmental effects. Early prenatal alcohol exposure
      can occur unintentionally (i.e., before a woman knows she is pregnant); in
      addition, women who drink at high levels before pregnancy are at increased risk
      for drinking during pregnancy. Ongoing surveillance for alcohol consumption among
      pregnant and childbearing-aged women is important for monitoring the impact of
      efforts to prevent this risk behavior. This report analyzes and compares data
      from the 1995 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and previously
      reported 1991 BRFSS data for women aged 18-44 years, and presents the prevalence 
      of alcohol consumption among pregnant women and overall and state-specific
      prevalence rates among women of childbearing age. The findings indicate a
      substantial increase in alcohol use among pregnant women from 1991 to 1995.

TI  - A comparison of children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and attention
      deficit, hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 150-61
AB  - Behavioral deficits are often noted in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
      and other individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure, including mental
      retardation, learning problems, social problems, and deficits in attention.
      Because attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been diagnosed so
      frequently in children with FAS and other alcohol related birth defects, there
      has been speculation that alcohol is an etiological factor in ADHD. To examine
      the relationship between behavior characteristics of children with fetal alcohol 
      exposure and those seen in children with a diagnosis of ADHD, 149 low
      socioeconomic status (SES), African-American children (mean age = 7.63 years)
      were given a battery of neuropsychological and behavioral tests. One hundred and 
      twenty-two were a sub-sample from a longitudinal study of prenatal alcohol
      exposure, whereas twenty-seven were identified in an ADHD Clinic. Children were
      given two sets of tests: (1) "traditional model" of conventional behavioral and
      psychiatric measures of ADHD and externalizing behavior; and (2) measures of
      neurocognitive functioning reflecting a four-factor model of the neurological
      basis of the components of attention (Mirsky AF, in Integrated Theory and
      Practice in Clinical Neuropsychology, Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,
      1989). Results indicated that children with the physical characteristics
      associated with prenatal alcohol exposure and those with a diagnosis of ADHD had 
      equivalent intellectual abilities with both clinical groups performing more
      poorly than contrast children from the same SES and ethnic groups. However, there
      were clear distinctions on behavioral and neurocognitive measures between the two
      clinical groups with those with ADHD performing more poorly on conventional tests
      sensitive to attentional problems and conduct disorder. When these two groups
      were compared on measures designed to measure the model of the four factors of
      attention by Mirsky, they were noted to have distinct patterns of deficits. These
      results suggested that the alcohol-affected children did not have the same
      neurocognitive and behavioral characteristics as children with a primary
      diagnosis of ADHD.

TI  - Was the fetal alcohol syndrome recognized in the ancient Near East?
PG  - 3-7
AB  - One of the most frequently cited examples of ancient prescience concerning the
      potential dangers of drinking during pregnancy is the story of Samson in the
      Biblical Book of Judges. The present article examines the relevant passages from 
      this and other related Biblical texts for indications that the ancient Hebrews
      were indeed aware of alcohol's potential to harm the fetus. This examination was 
      then broadened to include a survey of later Talmudic literature relating to
      drinking during pregnancy, and literature from Sumerian, Hittite, and Egyptian
      cultures contemporary with those found in the Bible. No evidence was found for
      concern in the ancient Near East about any possible harm.

TI  - Alcohol consumption among Oklahoma women: before and during pregnancy. The PRAMS 
      Working Group. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
PG  - 10-7
AB  - The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) utilizes a
      population-based survey of Oklahoma women with a recent live birth to examine the
      rates of alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. Nearly one-half of
      Oklahoma women report using alcohol during the three months before pregnancy and 
      one in thirteen women consume alcohol during the three months prior to delivery. 
      Moderate to heavy alcohol use before pregnancy was associated with additional
      perinatal risk factors including unintended pregnancy, inadequate prenatal care, 
      smoking, and physical abuse. Health providers play an important role in the
      prevention of alcohol related birth impairments such as fetal alcohol syndrome
      through early detection of problem drinking, patient education and appropriate
      referrals. However, one in four Oklahoma mothers report their health care
      provider did not talk to them about the harmful effects alcohol can have on their
      baby.

TI  - Growth hormone status in six children with fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 1456-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol exposure may cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS),
      which is associated with pre- and postnatal retardation. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Spontaneous 24-h growth hormone (GH) secretion was measured in six prepubertal
      short children with FAS (two boys and four girls) aged 4-14 years. The response
      to a GH stimulation test, and levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and 
      IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were also measured. Comparisons were made between
      the children with FAS and healthy children of both normal and short stature, as
      well as children born small for gestational age (SGA). RESULTS: There were no
      differences in the mean area under the curve above the baseline or the maximum
      level of GH during a 24-h period (GHmax) between the children with FAS and the
      reference groups. However, the estimated rate of spontaneous 24-h GH secretion in
      children with FAS was similar to that of children born SGA, but lower than in
      children of normal stature (p = 0.02). The plasma concentrations of IGF-I and
      IGFBP-3 were in the lower parts of the normal range. CONCLUSION: We conclude that
      GH secretion in short children with FAS is similar to that in short children born
      SGA; that is, in the lower range of normal children.

TI  - Impairments of number processing induced by prenatal alcohol exposure.
PG  - 1187-96
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a variety of cognitive deficits, notably in
      mathematics and higher order processes such as abstraction. An exploratory
      battery was developed to examine specific types of number processing impairments 
      in 29 adolescent and adult patients with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal
      Alcohol Effects (FAE) relative to controls matched for age, gender, and
      educational level. The battery included 11 tests: number reading and writing,
      exact calculation (addition, multiplication, subtraction), approximate
      calculation (selecting a plausible result for an operation), number comparison,
      proximity judgment, and cognitive estimation. The results indicated particular
      difficulties in calculation and estimation tests, with intact number reading and 
      writing ability. The greatest impairment was found in the cognitive estimation
      test, which is sensitive to frontal lobe lesions. The patterns of deficit
      described may reflect either the diffuseness of brain damage incurred from
      prenatal alcohol exposure, or a cumulative deficit in comprehension which may be 
      important for the acquisition of higher-order mathematical abilities.

TI  - Barriers to screening and counseling pregnant women for alcohol use.
PG  - 43-7
AB  - The consequences of fetal alcohol exposure are far-reaching and preventable.
      Health care providers are uniquely positioned to promote alcohol-free pregnancy, 
      yet an array of factors inhibit routine screening, counseling, and referral. This
      descriptive, qualitative study explored experiences and perceived barriers
      related to prenatal screening for alcohol use. The study included eight focus
      groups (71 participants) and 41 key informant interviews with health care
      professionals representing a mix of disciplines. Nearly 40% of the providers were
      physicians who regularly encounter women in their practices. While most providers
      ask about alcohol use, few probe in depth or follow up. The findings should alert
      program planners and medical educators to strengthen their preventive medical and
      public health practices.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: the nurse practitioner perspective.
PG  - 343-9; quiz 350-2
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause of mental retardation in the United
      States. The tragedy is that while FAS is irreversible, it is 100% preventable.
      FAS is caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol is a
      teratogen and acts in different ways to produce physical and central nervous
      system malformations and defects in the developing embryo and fetus. FAS is
      characterized by a history of maternal alcohol ingestion, central nervous system 
      dysfunction, growth deficiencies, and specific physical anomalies. Adolescents
      and adults with FAS have behavioral problems that differentiate them from other
      mentally disabled individuals. Nurse practitioners can have an impact on the
      prevalence of FAS by educating clients about FAS and its relationship to alcohol 
      consumption. NPs need to carefully identify high-risk women and their partners
      before a pregnancy occurs and assist with interventions to stop active alcoholism
      or alcohol use during pregnancy. NPs have the capability to decrease the severity
      of alcohol's effects during pregnancy through education, counseling, and
      intervention. NPs have the skills to work with case-finding and early
      identification of infants and children who display signs and symptoms of FAS.
      With such case-finding, early identification, and prompt referral to the
      appropriate diagnostic and/or supportive community agencies, individuals with FAS
      can receive timely intervention to minimize the effects of FAS. Adults with
      behavioral problems can be assessed for FAS and referred for appropriate
      assistance as well. Finally, NPs can facilitate public awareness of FAS through
      educational efforts with individuals, families, and communities.

TI  - Maternal alcohol use and risk of orofacial cleft birth defects.
PG  - 27-33
AB  - Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is a known cause of birth defects
      associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome, but its role in more common,
      isolated, craniofacial birth defects is not well understood. A population-based, 
      case-control study of orofacial clefts was conducted in Iowa using births during 
      1987-1991. Cases were identified by the Iowa Birth Defects Registry and
      classified as having a cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) or cleft
      palate only (CP) and whether the cleft was isolated or occurred with other birth 
      defects. Controls were selected from normal Iowa births. Maternal alcohol use
      during pregnancy was classified according to self-reported drinks consumed per
      month. Results are based on 302 controls and the following numbers in each case
      group: 118 isolated CLP, 56 isolated CP, 51 CLP with multiple defects, and 62 CP 
      with multiple defects. Compared to women who did not drink alcohol during
      pregnancy, the relative odds of isolated CLP rose with increasing level of
      maternal drinking as follows: 1-3 drinks per months, 1.5; 4-10 drinks per month, 
      3.1; more than 10 drinks per month, 4.7 (chi-square test for trend, P = 0.003).
      Adjustment for maternal smoking, vitamin use, education, and household income did
      not substantially alter these results. No significant association was found
      between alcohol use and isolated cleft palate or clefts in children with multiple
      birth defects. Alcohol use during pregnancy may be a cause of isolated cleft lip 
      with or without cleft palate.

PG  - 389-92
AB  - Controversy exists whether carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) is valuable
      as a screening tool for fetal alcohol syndrome. We evaluated serum CDT in 60
      non-alcohol-abusing women at different stages of normal pregnancy. CDT was weakly
      related to week of pregnancy and to human placental lactogen. CDT did not
      correlate with iron oestradiol or progesterone. By contrast, good correlations
      were found between transferrin and week of pregnancy or either sex hormone. Using
      multiple linear regression analysis, only transferrin and week of pregnancy were 
      important predictors of CDT. The diagnostic accuracy of CDT for detecting alcohol
      abuse may be limited in pregnant women and should be carefully assessed in
      relation to alcohol consumption.

TI  - Individual differences in perceived riskiness of drinking in pregnancy:
      antecedents and consequences.
PG  - 360-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether differences in perceived riskiness of
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to self-reported alcohol
      consumption among a community sample of pregnant women. Further, this study
      examined the impact of prior experiences on risk perceptions, focusing on
      previous pregnancy experiences and on previous alcohol-related problems. METHOD: 
      The hypothesized relationships among variables were tested simultaneously in a
      structural equation model. Subjects included 159 pregnant women, all of whom
      drank regularly before pregnancy recognition, who were recruited from prenatal
      clinics and through newspaper advertisements. RESULTS: Perceived riskiness of
      drinking during pregnancy was lower among women who had previously given birth to
      a healthy child and among women with greater numbers of previous alcohol
      problems. Prior adverse pregnancy experience did not predict perceived risk.
      Perceived risk negatively predicted actual alcohol consumption during pregnancy, 
      suggesting that previous healthy pregnancy experiences and alcohol problems
      increase drinking in pregnancy indirectly, through perceived risk. A direct
      positive effect from previous alcohol problems to drinking in pregnancy also was 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that risk perceptions play a role in
      drinking behavior among pregnant women and help to illuminate the relationship
      between parity and alcohol consumption. Interventions designed to reduce drinking
      among pregnant women, which have generally relied on providing information, may
      be improved by considering the impact of previous experiences and addressing
      erroneous beliefs.

AB  - As the debate over health care reform intensified a few years ago, Americans
      questioned their delivery system and pointed to Canada, Great Britain, and other

      these models and concluded: the United States, and Michigan in particular, will
      have difficulty improving the health status of its citizens and controlling
      health care expenditures unless we more effectively deal with a uniquely American
      phenomenon--the medicalization of social problems.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome--an ophthalmological and socioeducational prospective
      study.
PG  - 845-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: The eye is a sensitive indicator of adverse effects of prenatal
      alcohol exposure. Anomalies of the eyes and their adnexa are known to be
      associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), although long-term effects of
      these malformations are unknown. DESIGN: A prospective ophthalmologic follow-up
      (median, 11 years; range, 4 to 19 years) was performed in 25 children with FAS.
      Their social situation and educational status were also investigated. RESULTS:
      All but one of the children had ophthalmologic abnormalities. Fundus anomalies
      were observed in 23 children, of whom 19 had optic nerve hypoplasia. Thirteen
      children had concomitant strabismus. Microphthalmos, buphthalmos, phthisis,
      microcornea, coloboma of the iris and uvea, blepharoptosis, cataract, persistent 
      hyperplastic primary vitreous, and nystagmus were observed in single cases. The
      dysmorphology of the eyes remained unchanged during the follow-up period. In 2
      children with severe mental retardation and, initially, very poor vision, the
      severe visual handicap persisted. Seventeen children had an initial visual
      activity > or = 20/70, which remained unchanged in 10 children and improved in 7 
      children, despite the presence of optic nerve hypoplasia in 14 of the children.
      Ten mothers died, 8 of them because of alcohol-related diseases, and only 4 of
      the mothers were able to take care of their children. Sixteen children went to
      schools for the mentally retarded, and only 3 children had a normal school
      education without extra teaching assistance. CONCLUSIONS: In children with FAS,
      the major sequela, ie, brain, damage, remains despite extensive medical,
      educational, and social support. The presence of ophthalmic signs, which
      persisted but did not deteriorate during the follow-up period, strengthens the
      diagnosis of FAS, and the high frequency of ocular involvement indicates the
      importance of a complete ophthalmologic evaluation in children with FAS.

      of alcohol and the activities of nurses].
PG  - 287-304
AB  - Alcohol which, at first, is part of great ceremonies, parties, get-togethers, is 
      now becoming an important issue, for the number of women who consume alcoholic
      beverages has increased, and consequently the number of pregnant women,
      considering that not only the mother's body but also the one of the child that is
      being formed, are under metabolic changes, and inevitably will be a target for
      acquired alcohol alterations (intake). During the human development, it is
      important to take into consideration the pregnancy stage and depending on it, the
      individual becomes susceptible to teratogenic agents. This paper aims at
      providing some contribution related to this social issue bringing knowledge on
      the action of alcohol on the fetus alterations, from the slightest (irritability,
      lack of attention, mobility deficiency) until Fetal Alcoholic Syndrome (F.A.S.)
      and also tries to analyse the extent of people knowledge on the consequences of
      alcohol effects over pregnant women bodies and the possible changes that may
      occur with the fetus. In order to make this study possible, interviews have been 
      made by the use of forms with a population sample of about 100 people living in
      the northern, western, southern and interior low land regions. We have also
      visited some public and private institutions (23) on those regions, interviewing 
      nurses in paediatric wards, aiming at identifying the difficulties found related 
      to the diagnosis and management towards F.A.S.

TI  - Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and psychomotor development at preschool age.
PG  - 1654-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of moderate prenatal alcohol
      exposure on psychomotor development of preschool-age children in a longitudinal
      study. METHODS: Pregnant women were interviewed about their alcohol consumption
      at their first visit to the maternity hospital in Roubaix, France. Alcohol
      consumption before pregnancy and during the first trimester was assessed with a
      structured questionnaire. The psychomotor development of 155 children of these
      women was assessed with the McCarthy scales of children's abilities when the
      children were about 4 1/2 years old. RESULTS: Consumption of 1.5 oz of absolute
      alcohol (approximately three drinks) or more per day during pregnancy was
      significantly related to a decrease of 7 points in the mean score on the general 
      cognitive index of the McCarthy scales, after gender, birth order, maternal
      education, score for family stimulation, family status, maternal employment,
      child's age at examination, and examiner were controlled for. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study showed that moderate to heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy, at
      levels well below those associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, has effects on
      children's psychomotor development.

TI  - Surveillance for fetal alcohol syndrome in Colorado.
PG  - 690-7
AB  - The authors performed surveillance for fetal alcohol syndrome with an existing
      birth defects registry. Fetal alcohol syndrome cases were identified from
      multiple sources using passive surveillance and from two selected medical sites
      using enhanced surveillance. Between May 1992 and March 1994, a total of 173
      cases were identified, and the medical records of the cases were reviewed to
      determine whether the cases met a surveillance case definition for fetal alcohol 
      syndrome. Of these cases, 37 (21 percent) met either definite (28) or probable
      (9) criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome, 76 met possible criteria (44 percent),
      and 60 (35 percent) were defined as not fetal alcohol syndrome. Enhanced
      surveillance had the highest sensitivity for definite or probable cases, 31 of 37
      (84 percent), followed by hospital discharge data, 14 of 37 (38 percent). The
      authors also compared birth certificate information for 22 definite or probable
      cases in children born between 1989 and 1992 to birth certificate information for
      all Colorado births for that period. The proportion of mothers of children with
      fetal alcohol syndrome was statistically significantly greater (as determined by 
      exact binomial 95 percent confidence limits) than the proportion of all mothers
      for the following characteristics: black race (0.23 versus 0.05), unmarried (0.55
      versus 0.22), not employed during pregnancy (0.86 versus 0.43), and started
      prenatal care in the third trimester (0.18 versus 0.04). Surveillance for fetal
      alcohol syndrome can be accomplished with an existing registry system in
      combination with additional case finding and verification activities. Through
      followup investigation of reported cases, data can be gathered on the mothers of

TI  - Is moderate alcohol intake in pregnancy associated with the craniofacial features
      related to the fetal alcohol syndrome?
PG  - 156-61
AB  - Social drinking in pregnancy is common in many countries despite the fact that
      alcohol in high doses has teratogenic properties. The public health implications 
      would be appreciable if even moderate alcohol consumption were associated with
      embryonal or fetal maldevelopment. A presumably sensitive marker of an alcohol
      effect was used in this study, namely the fetal craniofacial features included in
      the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The study was based upon self-reported alcohol intake
      and photographs taken at birth or at 18 months of children born to mothers with a
      low or moderate alcohol intake during pregnancy. These women were selected during
      pregnancy by a two-stage sampling from all in well defined regions. Data were
      available concerning 323 pregnant women and some 200 to 220 children. A short
      palpebral fissure, a short nose to upper-lip distance and a broad root of the
      nose were expected to be associated with alcohol intake in early pregnancy, but
      such an association was only seen between binge drinking and a short palpebral
      fissure. No associations proved statistically significant at the 18-month
      examination and any association could merely be secondary to the known
      association between alcohol and birth weight.

TI  - [Fetal alcohol syndrome: neurobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure].
PG  - 697-708
AB  - Alcohol has been established as a teratogenic agent that in prenatal exposure can
      cause a variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes depending on dose, timing, and
      conditions of exposure. Although alcohol, like many other teratogenes, can cause 
      alterations in morphology, growth, and neurobehavioral outcomes, this report
      focuses primarily on the latter effects. As with other teratogens causing
      neurobehavioral aberrations, the neurobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol are 
      produced at lower exposure levels than the morphologic or growth effects, and
      except in extreme cases, they are more devastating to the offspring.
      Neurobehavioral effects are difficult to measure, however, because their
      manifestations change with the age of the offspring, and because, at the current 
      state of art, their measurement involves outcomes that can be exacerbated or
      ameliorated by postnatal experience. This report describes results of the studies
      on the long-term developmental and behavioral consequences of prenatal alcohol
      exposure.

PG  - 437-43
AB  - The incidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is now estimated at 0.97 cases per 1,000 
      live births in the general obstetric population and 4.3% among "heavy" drinkers. 
      The general incidence is more than 20 times higher in the United States (1.95 per
      1,000) compared to Europe and other countries (0.08 per 1,000). Within the United
      States, the incidence at sites characterized by low socioeconomic status, and
      African American or Native American background are about 10 times higher (2.29
      cases per 1,000) compared to sites with a predominant middle/upper SES and
      Caucasian background (0.26 per 1,000). Based on racial background, the number of 
      pregnant women in the U.S. giving birth to FAS children is 2,043 per year; if
      based on socioeconomic status, the number is slightly higher 2,366. Although race
      and SES are confounded in the U.S. studies, an examination of U.S. and European
      studies suggests that the major factor associated with FAS is low SES rather than
      racial background.

TI  - Use of international classification of diseases coding to identify fetal alcohol 
      syndrome--Indian Health Service facilities, 1981-1992.
PG  - 253-5, 261
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of the leading causes of preventable birth
      defects and developmental disabilities in the United States (1). Since 1979,
      surveillance systems for estimating and tracking FAS have categorized cases using
      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
      (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71 (2). This code comprises noxious influences affecting the
      fetus or newborn through placenta or breast milk, specifically alcohol, and
      includes FAS. Because the code is not specific for FAS and may reflect maternal
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy or other adverse effects of alcohol on the
      fetus, CDC assessed the usefulness of this code in ascertaining FAS cases by
      reviewing medical records for 1981-1993 from the Aberdeen Area Indian Health
      Service (IHS) and IHS contract facilities in eight of the 19 tribal or American
      Indian communities in the area. This report summarizes the findings of the
      analysis.

TI  - Physician awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome: a survey of pediatricians and
      general practitioners.
PG  - 1071-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the knowledge, clinical experience and perceived needs
      for resource materials of Saskatchewan physicians in regard to fetal alcohol
      syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related birth defects. DESIGN: Mailed survey. SETTING:
      Saskatchewan. PARTICIPANTS: All 48 pediatricians and half (394) of the family
      physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) practising in Saskatchewan
      received a questionnaire. The numbers of physicians who completed it were 24 and 
      249 respectively. RESULTS: The pediatricians were more likely than the other
      physicians to be aware of FAS and to have diagnosed at least one case of FAS.
      Among the FPs and GPs, the year of graduation from medical school was a
      significant factor in their knowledge of FAS and their diagnostic practices.
      Those who graduated before 1974, the year FAS was first described in the medical 
      literature, were less likely than the more recent graduates to be aware of FAS
      and to ask their patients about alcohol use during pregnancy but were more likely
      to feel comfortable discussing alcohol-related issues in families. All of the
      groups reported a need for more information about FAS and for resources on
      alcohol-related issues in general. CONCLUSIONS: Saskatchewan physicians are aware
      of FAS but have expressed a need for more information about FAS, particularly for
      parents, as well as physician training materials and information about where to
      refer patients with FAS and parents with alcohol-related problems.

TI  - Use of capture-recapture analyses in fetal alcohol syndrome surveillance in
      Alaska.
PG  - 335-41
AB  - Capture-recapture methods were used to estimate the prevalence of fetal alcohol
      syndrome among Alaska Natives born during the period 1982-1989. Potential cases
      were identified through an Indian Health Service (IHS) patient case file, a
      pediatric practice case file, and Medicaid claims from private physicians. A
      total of 74 Alaska Native children aged 3-10 years were identified with a
      notation of fetal alcohol syndrome by a physician in a medical record. Because
      not all of these cases had supporting documentation regarding the syndrome, they 
      were classified as possible cases. Of these possible cases, 50 met all five
      criteria for chart verification of the syndrome: physician notation of fetal
      alcohol syndrome, growth deficiency, facial features of the syndrome, central
      nervous system impairment, and a maternal history of alcohol abuse. These data
      provided observed prevalence rates of chart-verified fetal alcohol syndrome of
      3.1 per 1,000 live births for children born 1982-1985 (age 7-10 years), and 2.0
      per 1,000 live births for children born 1986-1989 (age 3-6 years).
      Capture-recapture analyses were conducted using cases identified by IHS and
      private physicians. These analyses estimated a prevalence of the syndrome of 3.8 
      per 1,000 live births for children born 1982-1985, and 3.1 per 1,000 live births 
      for children born 1986-1989. Based on the capture-recapture predicted number of
      cases, the IHS case file ascertained a greater percentage of cases among the
      older cohort (75%) than among the younger cohort (56%). These data illustrate the
      use of capture-recapture analyses in identifying the extent to which observed
      trends in rates may reflect differences in cases ascertainment over time (or by
      birth cohort). The application of capture-recapture in fetal alcohol syndrome
      surveillance, however, requires careful attention to the underlying assumptions
      of capture-recapture methods.

PG  - 1549-602
AB  - A comprehensive program for the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and
      alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) must consider multiple approaches and
      utilize knowledge from a variety of academic disciplines. Issues related to
      culture, society, behavior, belief systems, and medicine must all be considered
      for both etiology and solutions. A broad paradigm such as a public health model
      integrates various elements of approach. Because FAS and other levels of ARBD
      form a spectrum, from severe to negligible damage, a variety of drinking patterns
      with various characteristics and etiologies have to be addressed. This paper
      describes a multiple-level, comprehensive program with primary, secondary, and
      tertiary prevention components. Practical recommendations are proposed for
      addressing ARBD in a variety of arenas. While secondary and tertiary prevention
      hold promise for short-term reduction of FAS and ARBD prevalence, comprehensive
      prevention serves both short- and long-term effects. Multiple level prevention
      efforts are well served by clear and compelling vision and mission statements,
      and require careful evaluation.

TI  - Interpretations of risk: the use of scientific information in the development of 
      the alcohol warning label policy.
PG  - 1519-48
AB  - In 1988 the US Congress passed a law requiring a health warning label on
      alcoholic beverage containers, to include the message that pregnant women should 
      not drink alcohol. This paper addresses the role that scientific knowledge played
      in the formation and passage of the alcohol warning label policy. The
      constellation of birth defects implicated in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
      (including fetal alcohol effects) is sketched, and the FAS-related legislative
      events leading to the law's passage are described. A synopsis of the state of
      knowledge in 1988 regarding the effects of alcohol on the fetus is presented, and
      a snapshot of the social climate at that time is offered. The paper concludes
      with an update of relevant FAS research since the legislation was passed, and
      considers implications for future research and policy in the prevention of FAS.

TI  - Is having an alcoholic father hazardous for children's physical health?
PG  - 1619-27
AB  - Five hundred and ninety-nine French-Canadian pre-adolescent children for whom the
      alcoholic status of the parents was known were subdivided into eight groups,
      according to family structure (intact, non-intact), alcoholic status of the
      father (alcoholic, non-alcoholic) and gender of the target child (girl, boy).
      ANCOVAs were conducted (controlling for income, a factor which contributes to
      illness) for health-related variables in order to test the hypothesis that
      children of alcoholic fathers have more physical health problems compared to
      children without alcoholic fathers. Data pertaining to use of medical services,
      serious and minor illnesses and pregnancy-related events were analysed. It was
      found that overall, pre-adolescent children of alcoholics were not more ill than 
      children of non-alcoholics. There were, however, some differences worthy of note.
      Children of alcoholics had significantly lower birthweights than the children of 
      non-alcoholics. Boys in non-intact alcoholic families were of shorter stature
      than the other children. A three-way interaction showed that daughters of
      alcoholics and sons of non-alcoholics living in non-intact families were more
      likely to have used psychologists' services, as were sons of alcoholics in intact
      families. The results were discussed in terms of the heterogeneity of alcoholic
      families as well as the need to identify subgroups of children of alcoholics who 
      are at risk.

TI  - Parental alcoholism and early child development.
PG  - 14-8
AB  - In a cohort of 532 pregnant women from the general population, it was found by
      compilation of the results from interviews, police records, hospital records and 
      social welfare records that 23 mothers and 51 fathers in 64 families (12%) were
      suffering from alcoholism/heavy drinking. In these 64 families, the mother was an
      addict in only 13 families, both parents were addicts in 10 families, and in the 
      remaining 41 families only the father was an addict. Pregnancy, delivery, the
      newborn child and the child's development until their fourth year of life have
      been described using a multidisciplinary approach and a longitudinal prospective 
      design. An hypothesis on mental and physical development, and the occurrence of
      psychopathological symptoms in the children was tested. None of the children of
      the 13 alcoholic mothers was born with foetal alcohol syndrome, but foetal hazard
      was indicated by lower birth weight and a higher rate of perinatal deaths.
      Children of alcoholic parents had retarded mental development and showed more
      behavioural problems until 4 years of age than controls, but the differences
      related to physical development during the first year of life had then
      disappeared. Boys were found to be more vulnerable than girls. The consequences
      of behaviour seemed to be more pronounced when both parents were alcoholics. No
      obvious deviation was found when only the father was addicted. Regarding mental
      development, it appears that factors related to parental alcoholism, including
      genetic and social factors, and the sex of the child, are of greater importance
      than the neonatal score on reduced optimality.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 1025-32, 1035-6
AB  - The most notable features of fetal alcohol syndrome involve the face and eyes,
      and include microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, an underdeveloped philtrum
      and a thin upper lip. Evidence of intrauterine or postnatal growth retardation,
      mental retardation or other neurologic abnormalities, and at least two of the
      typical facial features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Newborns with the
      syndrome may be irritable, with hypotonia, severe tremors and withdrawal
      symptoms. Mild mental retardation, the most common and serious deficit, and a
      variety of other anomalies may accompany fetal alcohol syndrome. Sensory deficits
      include optic nerve hypoplasia, poor visual acuity, hearing loss, and receptive
      and expressive language delays. Atrial and ventricular septal defects, as well as
      renal hypoplasia, bladder diverticula and other genitourinary tract
      abnormalities, may occur. Complete abstinence during pregnancy is recommended,
      since alcohol consumption in each trimester has been associated with
      abnormalities, and the lowest innocuous dose of alcohol is not known.

TI  - Screening for pregnancy risk-drinking.
PG  - 1156-61
AB  - The efficacy of alcohol screening questionnaires, the TWEAK, T-ACE, NET, MAST,
      and CAGE, in detecting periconceptional risk-drinking, > or = 1 oz absolute
      alcohol/day, was investigated in 4743 African-American women attending an
      inner-city prenatal clinic who had reported ever drinking. Sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value, efficiency, follow-up rates, and receiver
      operating characteristics of the questionnaires were examined to compare the
      overall effectiveness of the questionnaires and their performance at cut-points
      defining positive scores ranging from 1 to 3. Relatively little difference
      between TWEAK, T-ACE, and MAST was seen in the receiver operating characteristic 
      accuracy indices; NET and CAGE lagged behind. Sensitivity/specificity scores for 
      the two questionnaires most sensitive at cut-point 1 were TWEAK (87/72) and T-ACE
      (83/75). At cut-point 2, sensitivity was optimized with respect to specificity;
      TWEAK (79/83) was significantly more sensitive than T-ACE (70/85; p = 0.002). At 
      cut-point 3, the two most sensitive tests were MAST (61/92) and TWEAK (59/94). In
      general, measures of merit were not greatly affected by the time between
      conception and the administration of the screens. Screening was most sensitive
      for women interviewed during the first 15 weeks of pregnancy; risk-drinkers
      tended to delay entry into prenatal care, increasing positive predictive values
      associated with screening later in pregnancy. This study confirms the utility,
      when screening for risk-drinking during pregnancy, of brief questionnaires that
      assess alcohol intake indirectly by asking women about their tolerance to
      alcohol's effects, psychological consequences of drinking, and significant
      others' concern about their drinking. It validates T-ACE and provides preliminary
      data indicating that TWEAK may outperform T-ACE.

AB  - Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome and other
      congenital anomalies. Substantial prenatal alcohol use can occur before a woman
      knows she is pregnant, and teratogenic risk increases if she continues to drink
      during pregnancy. Characterization of alcohol consumption patterns among women of
      childbearing age (i.e., age 18-44 years) can help identify the magnitude of this 
      problem, the subpopulations at greatest risk, and the geographic areas in which
      increased prevention efforts are needed. This report presents state-specific data
      on the prevalence of frequent alcohol consumption among women of childbearing
      age.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of alcohol consumption and fetal alcohol syndrome 
      awareness--Alaska, 1991 and 1993.
PG  - 3-6
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and 
      mental retardation in the United States (1). To reduce alcohol exposure to the
      developing fetus and to modify health-related behaviors, public health
      professionals and policy makers require effective methodologies to identify
      at-risk populations and develop strategies for preventing this problem. In
      Alaska, the prevalence of FAS is higher than the national average (2). Because of
      the need for information to assist in planning prevention programs, identifying
      training needs for service providers, and monitoring changes in factors related
      to FAS in target populations, the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services
      (ADHSS), the Indian Health Service (IHS), and CDC have conducted surveys to
      measure relevant knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors (KABBs) in selected
      populations in Alaska. This report summarizes survey findings during 1991 and
      1993 regarding the prevalence of alcohol consumption by and characteristics of
      women of childbearing age in Alaska and FAS-related KABBs in Alaska residents.

TI  - A longitudinal analysis of the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth.
PG  - 1124-9
AB  - Cross-sectional analyses have demonstrated that prenatal exposure to alcohol can 
      result in growth deficits at birth and in early childhood. However, there have
      been few longitudinal analyses of this relationship. This study presents an
      analysis of the longitudinal effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth. The
      model used for analysis was a general unbalanced repeated-measures model with a
      fully parameterized covariance matrix. Application of the model demonstrated that
      for length and head circumference, the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure was
      constant over time. The relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and growth
      in weight was more complex. Prenatal alcohol exposure affected the rate of growth
      between birth and the eight month. Subsequently, the relationship between weight 
      and prenatal alcohol exposure was constant. Therefore, for length and head
      circumference, prenatal alcohol exposure suppresses the rate of growth in the
      fetus but not at subsequent time points. For weight, exposure affects the rate of
      growth through the eighth month but not at subsequent time points. For each of
      the growth parameters, there is no catch-up growth, and the smaller size observed
      in the offspring is maintained.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome in twins of alcoholic mothers: concordance of diagnosis
      and IQ.
PG  - 857-61
AB  - The effects of teratogens can be modified by genetic differences in fetal
      susceptibility and resistance. Twins of alcoholic mothers provide a unique
      opportunity to study this phenomenon with respect to alcohol teratogenesis.
      Sixteen pairs of twins, 5 MZ and 11 DZ, all heavily exposed to alcohol
      prenatally, were evaluated. They represented all available twins of
      alcohol-abusing mothers who were on the patient rolls of the authors. The rate of
      concordance for diagnosis was 5/5 for MZ and 7/11 for DZ twins. In two DZ pairs, 
      one twin had fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), while the other had fetal alcohol
      effects (FAE). In 2 other DZ pairs, one twin had no diagnosis while one had FAE. 
      IQ scores were most similar within pairs of MZ twins and least similar within
      pairs of DZ twins discordant for diagnosis. Despite equivalent alcohol exposure
      within twin pairs, alcohol teratogenesis appears to be more uniformly expressed
      in MZ than in DZ twins. These data are interpreted as reflecting the modulating
      influence of genes in the expression of the teratogenic effects of alcohol.

TI  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neuromotor and cognitive development
      during early childhood: a series of case reports.
PG  - 608-17
AB  - The purpose of this article is to present a series of case reports of infants and
      young children who were exposed to alcohol prenatally. The five infants and two
      5-year-old twins in this series all presented facial features characteristic of
      prenatal alcohol exposure, and all had medical histories of maternal alcohol
      abuse. The neuromotor and cognitive development of these seven children is
      described by presenting results of standardized tests administered
      longitudinally. In addition, clinical observations of growth, behavior, feeding, 
      and musculoskeletal development are provided. Following a discussion of these
      assessment results, implications for physical therapy intervention and the need
      for clinical research are provided. Because children with fetal alcohol syndrome 
      or alcohol-related birth defects present a spectrum of developmental differences 
      that often include areas of concern to physical therapists, we need to increase
      our involvement in the assessment and treatment of these children as well as in
      research efforts to examine the efficacy of these interventions.

TI  - Sexually dimorphic effects of alcohol exposure in utero on neuroendocrine and
      immune functions in chronic alcohol-exposed adult rats.
PG  - 343-53
LID - 10.1006/mcne.1993.1044 [doi]
AB  - Maternal ethanol consumption has deleterious effects on the offspring's
      neuroendocrine and T-cell-dependent functions. Chronic alcohol consumption in
      adulthood has also been associated with activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA) function and immunosuppression which is demonstrable at the T-cell level.
      Our aim was to establish whether prenatal alcohol exposure alters the
      neuroendocrine and immune responses to chronic alcohol challenge in adult male
      and female offspring. Adult male rats placed on a liquid alcohol diet for 5 weeks
      had significantly decreased thymus weight, hypertrophied adrenals, and elevated
      plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels. Splenic lymphocyte Concanavalin A (Con
      A)-stimulated proliferation in the ethanol-treated rats was decreased compared to
      that in pair-fed controls. Thus, prolonged alcohol exposure activated the HPA
      axis and suppressed T-cell function. The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, as
      a predispositional factor, on the HPA axis and on the T-cell functions of adult
      chronic alcohol-exposed rats were examined in the offspring of dams fed ethanol
      (FAE) or an isocaloric liquid (PF) diet during the last 2 weeks of gestation. The
      adult offspring of both sexes and prenatal treatment groups were then placed on
      an alcohol-containing liquid diet for 5 weeks. Fetal alcohol exposure decreased
      anterior pituitary proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels and increased glucocorticoid
      receptor (GR) mRNA levels in males and decreased GR mRNA levels in females. There
      were no differences in hypothalamic CRF mRNA and GR mRNA levels between the
      prenatal treatment groups. There was no significant difference in Con
      A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation between FAE and PF males. However, FAE
      females showed Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation significantly higher
      than those of all other groups, including pair-fed females. Prostaglandin E(2)
      (PGE(2)) suppressed lymphocyte proliferation to a lesser degree in FAE males than
      in any other group. Furthermore, T-cell response to Con A was enhanced by
      indomethacin, a prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibitor, in FAE males suggesting
      that increased prostaglandin synthesis may occur in FAE males after chronic
      alcohol exposure. Increased levels of endogenous PGE(2) could also be inferred
      from the enhanced levels of interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha) mRNA in
      activated lymphocytes of male but not of female FAE offspring compared to PF. In 
      summary, the results of this study demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure
      leads to a specific HPA-related vulnerability in males to the deleterious effects
      of ethanol in adulthood. Although prenatal alcohol did not further aggravate the 
      effects of chronic alcohol exposure on lymphocyte proliferation response to Con A
      in adult male offspring, altered T-cell responses could be unmasked.

      fetal alcohol effects.
PG  - 771-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neuropathologic evaluation was performed on an infant with fetal
      alcohol effects. DESIGN: Coronal brain sections and representative tissue blocks 
      stained with hematoxylin-eosin, silver stain, and immunocytochemical stains for
      hypothalamic and pituitary hormones were evaluated for neuropathologic
      abnormalities. PATIENT: A 2.5-month-old American Indian girl who had been exposed
      to first-trimester maternal binge alcohol abuse died after persistent problems of
      growth failure, sodium imbalance, aberrant temperature regulation, respiratory
      distress, and seizures. RESULTS: Autopsy revealed severe microcephaly,
      hypertelorism, midfacial hypoplasia, a high-arched palate, shortened palpebral
      fissures, and a small brain. The frontal lobes were fused anteriorly; olfactory
      bulbs and tracts were absent; and optic nerves were hypoplastic. An enlarged and 
      bulbous hypothalamus obscured the pituitary gland. The thalamus and caudate
      nuclei were fused across the midline. Posteriorly, the single ventricle split to 
      form rudimentary lateral horns. The anterior corpus callosum, septum pellucidum, 
      fimbria, and fornices could not be identified. The anterior commissure and
      supraoptic nuclei were microscopically present. Many Purkinje cells were
      horizontally positioned, with abnormal dendritic structure. The posterior
      pituitary lobe was absent, and the infundibulum was flanked by a hypoplastic
      adenohypophysis and a large subarachnoid heterotopia. Immunocytochemical studies 
      identified only vasopressin and neurophysin in the hypothalamus and only growth
      hormone and prolactin in the pituitary gland. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, an
      association between fetal alcohol effects and a complex cerebral anomaly with
      features of incomplete holoprosencephaly and septo-optic dysplasia has not
      previously been reported and suggests a possible common pathogenesis needing
      further study.

TI  - Ratings of fetal alcohol syndrome facial features by medical providers and
      biomedical scientists.
PG  - 717-21
AB  - Medical providers, (obstetricians, pediatricians) and biomedical research
      scientists engaged in fetal alcohol research for many years evaluated facial
      photographs of newborns previously diagnosed clinically as having or not having
      fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Medical providers and biomedical scientists did not
      differ significantly in their ratings. Children independently diagnosed as having
      FAS were distinguished from non-FAS children by both groups. Providing raters
      with additional information about children (e.g., birth weight) did not alter
      judgements significantly. Raters were highly consistent in the ratings they
      assigned to children (r = 0.96). Accuracy was assessed using signal detection
      measures (e.g., likelihood ratio, d'). Based on these measures, the two
      occupational groups did not differ significantly, and rater accuracy was highly
      significant. Mean ratings were highly correlated with positive maternal Michigan 
      Alcohol Screening Test scores (r = 0.84). These results suggest that the facial
      features associated with fetal alcohol exposure are readily identifiable, and
      this, in turn, implies that recognition problems need not be a major contributor 
      to ascertainment of FAS.

TI  - The prevention of prenatal alcohol use: a critical analysis of intervention
      studies.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - Alcohol is a major cause of birth defects and mental retardation in the U.S. The 
      yearly cost to care for those affected has been estimated to be over $300
      million. Prenatal education and counseling have been advocated as techniques to
      reduce alcohol use in pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to critically
      review investigations that used these methods in order to determine their
      effectiveness. Reports of relevant studies were found by searching Medline, the
      ETOH database and bibliographies of primary sources. Only five studies were
      identified that met predetermined selection criteria. As judged by usual
      methodologic standards for intervention programs, only one was of acceptable
      quality. None employed a randomized design, and only two compared the treatment
      group to a control group. Both these studies found no difference in alcohol use
      between control and intervention groups. An ethical argument was used by several 
      authors to justify performing inadequately controlled studies. Since no
      intervention has proven to be superior to the usual care delivered to pregnant
      women, this problem can be overcome through the use of controls who receive this 
      level of care. Despite the public health importance of prenatal alcohol use,
      interventions to alter this behavior have not been rigorously evaluated, and the 
      benefits of any specific approach are unclear. Randomized trials are ethically
      justified and guidelines for undertaking such studies are proposed.

TI  - Diffuse corneal clouding in siblings with fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 484-93
AB  - Three of four siblings born to parents with a history of heavy alcohol abuse had 
      bilateral diffusely cloudy corneas at birth. These three siblings, who had mild
      systemic features of fetal alcohol syndrome, underwent corneal transplantations, 
      and their specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy.
      Histologically, the alterations in Bowman's layer ranged from thickening to total
      loss. There were varying degrees of corneal stromal edema. The unique pathologic 
      feature in the corneas was the anomaly of the anterior banded zone of Descemet's 
      membrane, which was either absent, poorly formed, or thinned in the central and
      peripheral cornea. The corneal endothelium was attenuated or multilayered. The
      diffuse clouding and the range of histologic abnormalities in the corneas might
      be related to the maternal alcohol abuse.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and long-term developmental consequences.
PG  - 907-10
AB  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a leading cause of congenital mental retardation 
      but little is known about the long-term development and adolescent outcome of
      children with FAS. In a 10-year follow-up study of 60 patients diagnosed as
      having FAS in infancy and childhood, we investigated the long-term sequelae of
      intrauterine alcohol exposure. We found that the characteristic craniofacial
      malformations of FAS diminish with time, but microcephaly and, to a lesser
      degree, short stature and underweight (in boys) persist; in female adolescents
      body weight normalises. Persistent mental retardation is the major sequela of
      intrauterine alcohol exposure in many cases, and environmental and educational
      factors do not have strong compensatory effects on the intellectual development
      of affected children.

TI  - [Alcohol drinking in parents and its relation with intellectual score of their
      children].
PG  - 98-105
AB  - Among children living in orphanages of the Metropolitan Region, the paternal
      alcohol ingestion patterns were investigated. According to abnormal parental
      alcohol ingestion, a sample of 291 children was studied, of whom 32% were living 
      in simple protection homes for infants with normal intellectual coefficient and
      52% in homes for mentally retarded boys. There was a higher frequency and
      intensity of abnormal alcohol ingestion among parents of infants living in homes 
      for the mentally retarded. Among these, 29% of mothers were illiterate and 11%
      had incomplete primary school education compared to mothers of simple protection 
      homes in whom the frequency of illiteracy was 10% and of incomplete primary
      education, 50%. Twenty percent of fathers of children living in homes for the
      mentally retarded were unemployed, 16% had occasional jobs and 11% had a stable
      work; these numbers were 11, 30 and 15% respectively for fathers of simple
      protection homes. Among infants living in homes for the mentally retarded,
      undernutrition was found in 44%, growth retardation in 51% and microcephaly in
      34% compared to 33, 30 and 11% in children living in simple protection homes.
      Sixteen percent of the sample had fetal alcohol syndrome, 24% among those living 
      in homes for the mentally retarded and 12% in simple protection homes. There was 
      an inverse relationship between offspring intellectual coefficient and the number
      of drinking parents.

PG  - 303-9
AB  - Peripheral vasodilatation with increased cardiac output, tachycardia and
      increased blood pressure are described after alcohol administration. An increased
      HDL-cholesterol is found in moderate drinkers (both HDL-2 and HDL-3 fractions),
      with diminishing risk of coronary heart diseases. Acute ethanol intake causes an 
      increased the level of triglycerides without changes in HDL-cholesterol level.
      This may be put into correlation with higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases
      in so-called "week-end" drinkers. Alcohol abuse may result in central diabetes
      insipidus. An increased elimination of lactate diminishes tubular secretion of
      uric acid with subsequent secondary hyperuricemia. Ethanol reduced the number of 
      lymphocytes, reduces phagocytosis by macrophages and diminishes the activity of
      NK-cells. Bone marrow cellulity diminishes with the subsequent reduction in
      erythropoiesis, trombopoiesis and leukopoiesis. Alcohol may cause sideropenic and
      megaloblastic anemia. There are two forms of alcohol muscle injury: the acute
      one, with myonecrosis and inflammatory reaction, and chronic one, with muscle
      weakness and atrophy. Alcohol is one of etiologic factors of osteoporosis. An
      acute intoxication result in transitory hypoparatthyreoidism, while chronic
      ethanol intake make grow the PTH level and decreases the level of D vitamin
      metabolises. Stimulation of cortisol secretion, decrease of testosterone level
      and a reversible decrease of T3 and T4 levels have been described following
      ethanol administration. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suffers alteration in
      alcoholics, and secondary amenorrhea is observed in female alcoholics. Ethanol
      behaves as an agonist on GABA receptor. Fetal alcohol syndrome together with
      Down's syndrome and spina bifida are the most frequent reasons of mental
      retardation in developed countries. Toxicity of ethanol affects the whole
      pregnancy period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Moderate maternal and paternal alcohol consumption and the risk of spontaneous
      abortion.
PG  - 364-70
AB  - Maternal alcoholism can lead to the fetal alcohol syndrome in offspring, but the 
      effect of more moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy remains an issue of 
      concern. Therefore, we analyzed data from a large case-control study of
      spontaneous abortion (626 cases, 1,300 controls) that ascertained maternal
      alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy, as well as paternal consumption.
      Asking when in pregnancy alcohol consumption changed allowed us to calculate a
      weighted average of the amount consumed weekly during the first trimester. The
      odds ratio for consumption of seven or more drinks per week was 1.9 [95%
      confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-3.4] when adjusted for maternal smoking, passive
      smoking, and maternal age. Data were too sparse to examine higher consumption
      levels. There was some evidence that cases may have had less opportunity than
      controls to decrease consumption during their shorter pregnancies, potentially
      biasing the odds ratio upward. The adjusted odds ratio for any paternal alcohol
      consumption was 1.2 (CI = 0.93-1.5), with no dose-response effect seen. Among
      pregnancies in which the mother did not drink, there was no association with
      paternal drinking.

TI  - Autism in fetal alcohol syndrome: a report of six cases.
PG  - 558-65
AB  - This paper reports on six children who all fulfill the criteria for fetal alcohol
      syndrome and have a history of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy, and who
      also fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of autism. Their behavior and natural
      history is compared with eight contrast FAS children, of similar ages and
      functional levels, who were free of autistic behaviors. The autistic FAS children
      were all moderately or severely retarded. Autistic behavior has not been commonly
      associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinicians need to be aware of this
      potential dual diagnosis so that appropriate educational and treatment resources 
      can be employed.

TI  - Dysmorphic features in offspring of alcoholic mothers.
PG  - 712-6
AB  - The frequencies of 60 minor physical anomalies and various craniofacial
      measurements in 52 children with alcohol exposure of various durations in utero
      were determined and compared with 48 non-exposed healthy children at a mean age
      of 27 months. Compared with non-exposed children a significantly higher total
      minor physical anomaly count was observed in those children exposed prenatally to
      alcohol throughout pregnancy. Binge drinking was not associated with an increased
      minor physical anomaly count. During the first year of life facial features were 
      judged according to subjective impression: 10 children had typical facial
      features of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 19 children were judged to have
      possible fetal alcohol effects on their face. Only six of them fulfilled the
      strict craniofacial criteria for diagnosis of FAS at the age of 27 months. Our
      results stress the importance of recognising also the subtle dysmorphic facial
      features associated with prenatal alcohol exposure: 22 of 29 (76%) of exposed
      children judged to have typical or possible features of FAS during the first year
      showed signs of central nervous system dysfunction at the age of 27 months.

TI  - [Alcohol during pregnancy damages eye and vision development].
PG  - 313-5
AB  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes malformations of the eyes with
      serious consequences to the vision of the affected children. A high percentage
      (up to 90 per cent) of children suffering from the fetal alcohol syndrome have
      eye abnormalities of different kinds. The most typical are hypoplasia of the
      optic nervehead and increased tortuosity of the retinal vessels, especially of
      the arteries, both occurring in up to half of the cases. Visual acuity is often
      reduced. Considering the developmental timing of different tissues of the eye,
      one can presume that there is a risk for deleterious effects of alcohol on eye
      structures at any point of time from early gestation until development is
      completed.

TI  - Alcohol and narcotics. Epidemiology and pregnancy risks.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - Among alcohol and narcotics, alcohol is most comprehensively documented as a
      teratogen. However, for all other narcotics, data are continuously accumulating, 
      convincingly displaying the teratogenic effects. The proportions between
      "somatic" teratogenicity and "behavioral" teratogenicity vary between the
      different agents. Preventive work in prenatal clinics and among social workers,
      as well as objective mass media attention to the problem, seems to have lowered
      the incidence of severe fetal alcohol syndrome where the above-mentioned
      activities have been practiced. The female alcohol consumption in Sweden
      decreased from 1976 to 1985; thereafter, a slow continuous increase is underway
      again. In Sweden the number of recruits to narcotic abuse peaked in the 1970s and
      early 1980s. Thereafter, the number of recruits among females decreased, but
      abuse has continued among the members of the older age groups.

AB  - A hospital based, comprehensive approach to the prevention of Fetal Alcohol
      Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects that combines clinical assessment, community

      screening of pregnant women in prenatal clinics. The major, although not
      exclusive, focus of the program is on tertiary prevention undertaken with women
      defined as "high risk" for producing alcohol affected children. Of the 48 women
      referred to the program at the Tuba City, AZ, Indian Medical Center between
      January 1988 and July 1989, 39 (81 percent) became participants. Complete
      followup was possible on 31; 17 of them reported alcohol abstinence in July 1989,
      18 months into the program. Of the 29 referred women who were pregnant at the
      time, 21 agreed to participate; of these, 19 (85.7 percent) were abstinent by the
      third trimester of pregnancy; 5 voluntarily accepted offers of contraceptive
      measures after the birth of their child.

TI  - Morphometry of the neonatal fetal alcohol syndrome face from 'snapshots'.
PG  - 531-4
AB  - Recognition of alcohol-related birth defects is less successful in the neonate
      than in older children. Clarren et al. (1987) were able to describe the geometry 
      of the FAS face at age 7. To define neonatal facial features of FAS, 3 reference 
      points were used to map 7 frontal and 7 profile landmarks coded as standardized
      cartesian coordinates. These landmarks were digitized from snapshots of 21
      neonates, prospectively diagnosed as FAS blinded for prenatal alcohol exposure,
      and 76 non-FAS controls. In the controls, race was found to be a significant
      determinant of landmarks, as expected. Using discriminant analysis and
      controlling for race, the FAS face was characterized by landmark measurements
      which correspond to short palpebral fissure, scooping out of the nasal bridge and
      thin vermilion [F(4,71)-7.8, r sq-30%, p < .01]. Jackknifed sensitivity was 75%, 
      specificity, 79%. These findings suggest that FAS-defining features can be
      quantified in the neonate via computer-based screening of infants from at-risk
      pregnancies.

TI  - Alcohol use in pregnancy, craniofacial features, and fetal growth.
PG  - 302-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the relationship between the level of
      alcohol consumption in pregnancy and craniofacial characteristics of the neonate.
      DESIGN: This was a prospective survey of a sample of pregnant women, stratified
      on prepregnancy level of alcohol consumption. SETTING: The study was carried out 
      at the public antenatal clinic of Roubaix maternity hospital. PARTICIPANTS:
      During an eight month period, 684 women (89% of those eligible) were interviewed 
      in a standardised way at their first antenatal clinic visit. Of these, all who
      were suspected of being alcoholic or heavy drinkers (at least 21 drinks per week)
      were selected for follow up, as was a subsample of light (0-6 drinks per week)
      and moderate (7-20 drinks per week) drinkers. Of 347 women selected in this way, 
      202 had their infants assessed by a standardised morphological examination.
      MEASUREMENTS AND AND MAIN RESULTS: Suggestive craniofacial characteristics of the
      infants, present either in isolation or in association with growth retardation
      ("fetal alcohol effects"), were compared in relation to maternal alcohol
      consumption (alcoholic 12%; heavy drinking 24%; moderate drinking 28%; light
      drinking 36%). No differences were found between light and moderate drinkers.
      Infants born to alcoholics had a greater number of craniofacial characteristics
      and the proportion with features compatible with fetal alcohol effects was
      higher. There was a similar trend for infants of heavy drinkers. Infants of heavy
      drinkers who had decreased their alcohol consumption during pregnancy had fewer
      craniofacial features. Infants of heavy smokers were also found to have increased
      numbers of craniofacial characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Craniofacial morphology
      could be a sensitive indicator of alcohol exposure in utero. Altered morphology
      is usually considered specific for alcohol exposure, but the relation observed
      with smoking needs further exploration.

TI  - [Are children with alcohol embryopathy latent alcoholics? A study of the risk for
      developing dependence].
PG  - 157-62
AB  - Within 3 years 48 caretakers and parents of children with fetal alcohol syndrome 
      were asked about the childrens experience and contact with alcohol. The children 
      were mainly raised in foster and adoptive families (40/48 cases), where usually
      moderate or restricted consumption of alcohol was common. The children were
      between 4-18 years (means = 7; 5) of age. In 5 children alcohol consumption was
      observed once or several times. Some children showed signs of increased desire
      for drinking alcohol. A substance related addiction was never observed until now.
      Nevertheless the risk of addiction development has to be considered as dangerous 
      in any case of fetal alcohol syndrome. All conditions and risk factors for
      addiction development are present: a) Hereditary factors in the family of origin.
      b) Early use and adaption in the prenatal period by maternal drinking. c) The
      social surroundings and family. d) The particular structure of personality in
      these children, characterised by uncritical behavior, mental retardation,
      emotional instability and easy seduction. The risk of addiction development can
      be estimated to 30%. In a society of lacking alcohol prohibition it will be
      impossible to keep alcohol away from the children. As in dry alcoholics the
      children have to learn "to live in association with alcohol without drinking it".
      Besides it is important for the parents, that they learn to help their child to
      cope with the danger of alcohol. This ist possible by means of information,
      strengthening of a positive self-image and faith in the child's capacity for
      insight.

TI  - Preventing alcohol related birth damage: a review.
PG  - 349-64
AB  - Since 1974 numerous clinical studies have made it clear that heavy alcohol
      consumption during pregnancy (in excess of 80 g or 8 units daily) can result in a
      child being born with a specific combination of physical and mental disabilities 
      known as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. More moderate levels of intake (as little as
      10 g of 1 unit daily) are associated with other fetal problems known as Fetal
      Alcohol Effects. The most common of these is growth retardation. Reduction of
      alcohol consumption is beneficial to pregnancy outcome. However, despite this
      great clinical and research interest within the field there has been
      comparatively little attention paid to researching possible preventative
      strategies and appropriate policy development. This paper first describes the
      size of the problem posed by drinking in pregnancy in the U.S.A. and the U.K.,
      detailing the contrasting policy response on either side of the Atlantic. It
      examines the difficulties of formulating appropriate advice and then assesses the
      available research reports on preventative measures. The strategies described
      include general publicity and counselling for pregnant women. In addition,
      attention has been paid to the problems of dissemination by emphasising
      professional education. One major shortcoming is that most of these studies
      appear to have been carried out with little reference to existing knowledge on
      health education and promotion, or educational work in the antenatal or alcohol
      fields. In addition, little attention appears to have been paid to the
      characteristics of the groups at whom intervention might be targeted or the
      underlying social or psychological factors which maintain drinking in these
      groups. The second part of this paper, therefore, attempts to suggest appropriate
      avenues for developing preventative strategies by presenting a wide-ranging
      review with special reference to British experience. Particular attention is
      given to the issues of form and content of appropriate messages, targeting of
      risk populations, the venue for intervention, and media and the actual mechanisms
      involved in implementing the programme. We conclude that women should be advised 
      to limit their alcohol consumption to no more than one unit a day when they are
      either pregnant or planning a pregnancy. We recommend that pregnant women should 
      be asked about their alcohol and given appropriate advice during routine
      antenatal clinic visits. We suggest that the form of advice should be designed
      with the characteristics of the risk population in mind.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

TI  - Mutual support groups to reduce alcohol consumption by pregnant women: marketing 
      implications.
PG  - 47-63
AB  - This paper reports on a study of social support and alcohol consumption of 153
      women during pregnancy. The majority of women changed their alcohol intake
      patterns during pregnancy because of concern for the health of the fetus. Most
      women decreased the amount and frequency of drinking and changed their beverage
      of choice. Social support was found to be significantly related to reduction in
      alcohol use during pregnancy. Social support came from relationships with
      specific individuals and groups of individuals. Health care providers may be able
      to extend the range of their work by designing specific prevention strategies
      targeted toward the development and implementation of mutual support groups for
      pregnant women. The marketing discipline has identified certain characteristics
      of the mutual benefit association, an organization which exists exclusively for
      the benefit of its members. The authors propose that the mutual support group,
      often used to promote health-related behaviors, is a special case of the mutual
      benefit association; further, that appropriate application of established
      marketing principles and practices will be effective in promulgating the mutual
      support group. The authors offer a marketing strategy for the mutual support of
      pregnant women, a strategy which should be effective in further reducing the
      alcohol intake of pregnant women.

      is 1.9 per 1,000 live births. FAS is recognized as the leading cause of mental
      retardation in the West, in addition to producing a constellation of birth
      defects. One in six women of childbearing age drinks enough alcohol to jeopardize
      a developing fetus. Warning labels on alcohol should be considered to publicize
      the dangers to the fetus.

      discussed using data on two cases of this pathology. In the authors' opinion,
      three conditions are necessary to make diagnosis of alcoholic embryo- and
      fetopathy (i.e. maternal alcoholism history, morphologic signs of embryo- and
      fetopathy, ethanol concentration in fetal blood and urine). Alcohol embryo- and
      fetopathy must be differentiated from acute ethanol intoxication, during which
      microscopic visceral signs of embryo- and fetopathy are absent and ethanol blood 
      concentration exceeds 2.0%.

      history.
PG  - 399-401
AB  - Assessment of alcohol-related fetal risk is complicated by difficulties in
      assessing alcohol exposure. We previously described considerable underreporting
      of alcohol use during pregnancy, particularly among problem drinkers. This report
      is of the relationship between severity of drinking problems and the magnitude of
      underreporting. Pregnant disadvantaged women responded to the Michigan Alcoholism
      Screening Test (MAST) at the first antenatal visit and provided self-report data 
      regarding alcohol use at each antenatal visit. Five years later, 238 of these
      women again provided self-report information about drinking during the target
      pregnancy. Underreporting was defined as a positive difference between the
      indices computed from the retrospective and the in-pregnancy data. The
      relationship of underreporting to the MAST score was highly significant and
      indicated a 20-fold increase in underreporting from the lowest to highest MAST
      score. However, the marked individual variability seen in this relationship
      indicates that while the MAST may be a better indicator of risk than self-reports
      of drinking, it is also not sufficient for the purpose. Further work examining
      other measures and techniques for obtaining drinking information is indicated.

      problem].
PG  - 575-82; discussion 582-5
AB  - Foetal and neonatal consequences of exogenous intoxications are nowadays better
      apprehended especially regarding alcohol. Alcoholism during pregnancy is the
      cause of the syndrome of foetal alcoholism described in France by Lemoine in 1968
      and then by Jones and Smith in 1973. The prevalence of the table is 1 out of 700 
      to 800 deliveries for the severe forms and concerns especially by not exclusively
      the most underprivileged sections of the population and shows in: -- a very
      specific dysmorphy of skull and face and other abnormalities which give to the
      face a singular and persistent aspect; -- various and frequent malformative
      abnormalities with a pronounced tendency for cardiopathy. Most of them are latent
      or of late discovery; -- a constant growth lateness which is also part of the
      table as well as prematurity and spontaneous abortion. Hypotrophy is moderate,
      total, and cerebral; -- effects on central nervous system: it is the third
      overall cause of mental lateness after trisomy and deficiency of neural canal.
      Other causes and themselves to alcohol to produce these effects that show
      themselves on badly affected children or dead in utero because of macroscopic and
      microscopic alterations of numerous cerebral structures. From a clinical view
      point, they show themselves by abnormalities of the neural canal, a decreasing of
      the crane perimeter, neonatal neurologic troubles due to deficiency in the first 
      hours of life, followed during the second and third day by a table evoking a
      weaning syndrome. The evolution on a medium term is characterized by the
      persistence of the crane and skull dysmorphy modified by parents phenotype, a
      persistence of the growth lateness leading to dwarfism in the severe forms. In
      the moderate and medium form thinness and paleness are spectacular and
      malformations exist in 2/3 of the cases. The neurologic and behaving evolution is
      documented by some prospective studies. They tend to indicate the persistence for
      the severe forms of troubles concerning hyperactivity, lack of attention and
      decreasing of the crane perimeter as well as a main mental lateness in half of
      the cases. The study made in Roubaix shows that behaving and intellectual
      troubles are more pronounced when the dysmorphy is marked. The effects of alcohol
      lead to a syndrome of foetal alcoholism when the level of alcoholization is high 
      which correspond to K. Sulik's experimental data in 1982. On the other hand, a
      relation dose-effect has not been yet demonstrated except for hypotrophy. This is
      the same for threshold-dose. There is no residual effects confirming that
      alcoholism and its intensity during pregnancy have a direct effect upon
      descendants. As a matter of fact after weaning and recovery children are again
      normal and normotroph. Pregnancy and especially delivery are privileged period
      for detection of maternal alcoholism and beginning of a prevention in a view to
      avoid. These effects during a later pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Etiology of alcoholism: relevance of prenatal hormonal influences on the brain,

PG  - 59-63
AB  - Because of possible prenatal hormonal influences on the brain, leading to
      anomalous dominance, pharmacological and neurochemical asymmetry, and consequent 
      antisocial personality and phobic anxiety, the subject ingests ethanol for its
      tension-reducing properties via endorphinergic activation and the dopaminergic
      reward system. Due to presence of stress, and effects of anomalous dominance on
      ethanol metabolizing enzymes, ethanol-oxidizing systems are activated leading to 
      high rates of ethanol elimination from the blood, and thus the decreased
      intensity of reaction to ethanol, leading to tolerance. Since stress can cause a 
      decrease in the number of opiate receptors, a vicious cycle of ingesting more and
      more ethanol may be instituted.

AB  - A computer-assisted biophysical assessment was performed in a woman with chronic 
      alcoholism at 37 weeks' gestation. She was first seen in a state of acute alcohol
      intoxication (322 mg/dl). Although fetal breathing movement incidence was normal 
      (30%), fetal tachypnea (67 breaths per minute) and decreased fetal body movements
      (0.11%) were seen. Because these findings differ from those previously reported
      with regard to normal pregnancies exposed to lower levels of alcohol, their
      implications are discussed.

TI  - Drinking and smoking patterns amongst women attending an antenatal clinic--II.
      During pregnancy.
PG  - 163-73
AB  - This paper describes smoking and drinking patterns during pregnancy amongst a
      cohort of 2266 women who enrolled at a London antenatal clinic 1982-1983. Only
      12% of mothers were non-drinkers before pregnancy, but 44% abstained in the first
      trimester, 38% in the second and 50% in the third. Before pregnancy 20% of
      mothers were drinking more than the recommended 10 units of alcohol per week.
      This dropped to 6% during pregnancy. Mean consumption at each of the three stages
      of pregnancy was highest amongst those mothers who were the heaviest drinkers
      before pregnancy. The heaviest pre-pregnancy drinkers were also the least likely 
      to abstain at any point in pregnancy. Of those mothers who were drinking less
      than 10 units of alcohol per week before pregnancy, 3% increased during
      pregnancy. Wine was the most popular beverage choice but heavier drinkers were
      more likely to drink beers and spirits in addition. Before pregnancy 29% of
      mothers smoked. This dropped to 23% in pregnancy. Consumption levels fell amongst
      those who continued smoking. The heaviest pre-pregnancy smokers were the most
      likely to reduce but the least likely to stop. Smoking was positively associated 
      with the level of both pre-pregnancy and pregnancy drinking. The most commonly
      cited reasons for changes in drinking and smoking habits in pregnancy were
      concern for the child, concern for self or concern for both. Feeling sick or ill 
      was a more commonly stated reason for reduction of drinking than smoking. Social 
      pressures were important in reducing smoking, but the mass media were quoted as a
      more important influence in reducing drinking. Mothers who drank more than 10
      units of alcohol per week during pregnancy were more likely to be older, of
      higher social status and primiparous. In contrast those who smoked in pregnancy
      were more likely to be younger, of lower social status and multiparous. This has 
      important implications for planning antenatal health education.

      Before pregnancy.
PG  - 153-62
AB  - This paper provides basic epidemiological data on smoking and drinking patterns
      before pregnancy amongst 1117 pregnant women attending a London antenatal clinic.
      Similar data are already available from North America and surveys have been done 
      in Scotland but there is a dearth of information from England and Wales. In the
      early stages of pregnancy, prior to recognition, heavy alcohol consumption (in
      excess of 56 units of alcohol per week) is associated with the Foetal Alcohol
      Syndrome. More moderate levels of intake (as little as 10 units of alcohol per
      week) have been associated with Foetal Alcohol Effects such as growth
      retardation. In our sample 19% of the mothers were drinking more than 10 units of
      alcohol per week. Six per cent were consuming more than the 14 units of alcohol
      currently recommended by three of the medical Royal Colleges as 'safe' for
      non-pregnant women. Average weekly alcohol consumption was related to both the
      usual frequency and amount drunk, but also to binge drinking, beverage choice and
      combination, and reasons for drinking. In general, drinking was frequent and
      light. Those women who drank more per week tended to drink more frequently than
      those in the lower weekly consumption bands. Fourteen per cent of the sample
      admitted to binge drinking (more than 14 units of alcohol in a single sitting).
      Wine was the most popular beverage type. The range of beverages consumed was
      wider in the higher alcohol consumption bands. Those in the lower bands were more
      likely to drink only one beverage type. Social reasons for drinking were of far
      greater importance than reasons which emphasised the effects of drinking.
      However, heavy drinkers were unlikely to drink solely for social reasons.
      Seventy-seven per cent of the mothers were non-smokers, but the incidence of
      smoking increased in the higher alcohol consumption bands. The demographic
      characteristics of the smokers were in marked contrast to those of the heavier
      drinkers. Smokers tended to be younger, of lower social status and multiparous,
      whereas the heavier drinkers were more likely to be older, of higher social
      status and primiparous. This finding is of fundamental importance to those
      interested in planning screening or intervention programmes.

      20 cases (51%) distortions in the brain shaping were detected with excessive
      plication and invaginations of the brain walls. This led to the brain development
      disorder known as true porencephalia, and others, termed as cysts with normal and
      reverse order of layers, porencephalia with reverse layer ordering. The authors
      suggest that brain shaping distortions are variants of teratogenesis of its
      innate defects.

PG  - 2-6
AB  - During the last years the per-capita-consumption of pure alcohol in the Federal
      Republic of Germany is slightly decreasing. In 1986 every person consumed an
      average of 11.5 litres of pure alcohol (146.4 litres of beer, 23.3 litres of wine
      and 6.1 litres of spirits). The amount of the alcohol addicts must be estimated
      at about 1.5 to 1.8 million people. Among the alcohol-abusers and alcohol-addicts
      the rate of mortality, caused by accidents, physical diseases and suicides is
      many times higher than among the non-drinking or rarely drinking population.
      Alcoholism liver-cirrhosis and pancreatitis are responsible for about 20.000
      deaths per annum and for the loss of 400.000 years of life.

AB  - 1. The safe limits of alcohol intake are difficult to define because of
      individual variations in susceptibility to damage. The present recommendations
      are based largely on epidemiological studies of liver damage. 2. Recent
      investigations indicate that alcoholic brain damage is much more common than
      previously suspected. More information is required about its natural history and 
      the characteristics of individuals most likely to suffer damage. 3. Thiamin
      (vitamin B1) deficiency has long been associated with brain damage and may result
      from a number of additive causes in the alcoholic patient. New information
      indicating damage to the protein moeity of some of the thiamin-using enzymes has 
      been reviewed, as have possible mechanisms of brain cell necrosis.

TI  - Independent dysmorphology evaluations at birth and 4 years of age for children
      exposed to varying amounts of alcohol in utero.
PG  - 772-8
AB  - Two groups of 4-year-old children were examined by a dysmorphologist without
      knowledge of previous examination results or prenatal exposure and categorized as
      to whether or not they showed fetal alcohol effects. A priori classification of
      children into the two groups was on the basis of their mothers' self-report of
      drinking when interviewed during pregnancy. Children born to 108 mothers in a
      "heavier" drinking group (absolute alcohol concentration greater than or equal to
      30 mL/d [1.0 oz/d]) were compared with a matched group of children born to 97
      mothers whose average absolute alcohol concentration was less than 0.3 mL/d (0.01
      oz/d). The percentage of children with fetal alcohol effects in the heavier
      drinking v the comparison group was 20.4% v 9.3%. When fetal alcohol effects were
      studied in relation to only the absolute alcohol concentration scores, there was 
      a significantly greater chance of a child being classified as having fetal
      alcohol effects with increasing levels of alcohol exposure prior to recognition
      of pregnancy (P = .013). A logistic regression, run on the absolute alcohol
      concentration scores and other primary exposures, indicated that fetal alcohol
      effects classification was not significantly related to nicotine, caffeine, or
      marijuana but was significantly related to absolute alcohol concentration scores 
      even after statistically adjusting for these other exposures (P = .002).
      Classification of fetal alcohol effects at 4 years of age was compared to a fetal
      alcohol effects classification obtained at birth by an independent
      dysmorphologist in a sample of 75 subjects examined at both ages, and 80% of the 
      infants classified as having fetal alcohol effects at birth were classified as
      having fetal alcohol effects at 4 years of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and
      sex-hormone-binding globulin in pregnant alcohol abusers.
PG  - 731-5
AB  - We compared serum concentrations of total and free testosterone, androstenedione,
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and sex-hormone-binding globulin in 40
      pregnant women exhibiting consistent alcohol abuse and in 20 abstinent pregnant
      controls. Sixteen drinkers gave birth to infants with fetal alcohol effects; the 
      remaining 24 drinkers delivered healthy infants. Drinking patients with healthy
      infants had normal concentrations of total and free testosterone,
      sex-hormone-binding globulin, and DHEAS, but their levels of androstenedione
      increased between weeks 20-40 of pregnancy. Maternal drinking leading to fetal
      alcohol effects was accompanied by lowered concentrations of sex-hormone-binding 
      globulin throughout pregnancy and by low total testosterone concentrations,
      although the latter difference reached statistical significance only at 16-20
      weeks' gestation. In contrast, drinking leading to fetal damage was associated
      with higher free testosterone levels between weeks 16-20 of pregnancy and lowered
      concentrations of DHEAS between weeks 16-32 of gestation, whereas the
      androstenedione levels tended to be high throughout pregnancy. These changes in
      androgens can be explained in part by low sex-hormone-binding globulin
      concentrations, an insufficient supply of DHEAS by the adrenals, and reduced
      peripheral conversion of androstenedione to testosterone.

TI  - Alcohol counselling of 85 pregnant problem drinkers: effect on drinking and fetal
      outcome.
PG  - 243-7
AB  - Eighty-five pregnant problem drinkers were given intensive counselling throughout
      gestation to persuade them to reduce or stop their alcohol intake. Nevertheless, 
      7% of their blood specimens collected at follow-up visits contained ethanol.
      Fifty-five women (65%) were able to reduce their alcohol consumption by at least 
      50%. Alcohol abuse was associated in a dose-dependent manner with fetal growth
      retardation detectable by ultrasonography from 27 weeks gestation. Twenty infants
      (24%) had a complete fetal alcohol syndrome and 22 (26%) had some features of
      'fetal alcohol effects' (FAE). In addition, the rate of structural malformations 
      was high (13%). Of the women with continuous alcohol abuse 89% gave birth to
      infants with at least one feature of FAE compared with only 40% of those who
      decreased their alcohol consumption.

TI  - Urinary prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolites in drinking pregnant women and
      in their infants: relations to the fetal alcohol effects.
PG  - 61-6
AB  - To study the effect of maternal ethanol consumption on the production of
      prostacyclin and thromboxane, we measured urinary 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha
      (a hydration product of prostacyclin), 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha
      (generated from 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha through beta oxidation), and
      thromboxane B2 (a hydration product of thromboxane A2) using consequent
      high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassays in 39 drinking women
      and 16 abstinent controls, and in their infants. Thirty-one drinkers and two
      control women smoked. Maternal ethanol consumption was accompanied by increased
      output of prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolites in the mothers, but no
      relationship was apparent between the increased metabolites and development of
      fetal alcohol effects in 22 mothers. There were no differences between smoking
      and nonsmoking drinkers in the excretion of these prostanoids. All the infants
      born to the drinkers had increased thromboxane B2 excretion, but the excretion of
      prostacyclin metabolites was increased only in infants with fetal alcohol
      effects. The ratio between prostacyclin and thromboxane was reduced in infants
      with fetal alcohol effects. Thus, maternal ethanol consumption is associated with
      enhanced prostacyclin and thromboxane synthesis, perhaps in the kidneys and/or
      systemic circulation and vascular bed. Similar changes may also occur in the
      fetus and/or newborn with fetal alcohol effects.

      alcohol].
PG  - 60-6
AB  - Nineteen 5 to 12-weeks-old embryos from women abusing alcohol during pregnancy
      (alcoholism, habitual drinking) were studied. In 15 (79%) the brain development
      disorders were detected. Most frequently concerned were the brain hemispheres.
      Defective development signs were also noted in the midbrain, choroidal plexus and
      diencephalon. Microdysplasias were found in different brain regions. In one case 
      embryonal signs of the capsula interna, nucleus caudatus, putamen, epiphysis
      cerebri, habenular nuclei, chiasma, optical tracts were absent. Six groups
      presenting most typical deviations were identified. The degree of embryonal brain
      disorders correlated with its mother's alcohol abuse severity.

TI  - gamma-Glutamyl transferase and mean cell volume reveal maternal alcohol abuse and
      fetal alcohol effects.
PG  - 344-8
AB  - Serial measurements of gamma-glutamyl transferase and mean cell volume were done 
      in 85 pregnant alcohol abusers (320 samples). These included 26 moderate
      drinkers, 30 heavy drinkers, and 29 alcoholic women. Studies of 28 pregnant women
      who denied the use of alcohol (138 samples) showed that pregnancy itself had no
      effect on gamma-glutamyl transferase and mean cell volume. However,
      gamma-glutamyl transferase was increased in 14.9%, 31.7% and 59.1% of the samples
      collected from moderate drinkers, heavy drinkers, and alcoholic women,
      respectively, and likewise mean cell volume was elevated in 10.8%, 17.2%, and
      40.2%, respectively. Either gamma-glutamyl transferase or mean cell volume was
      high or both were high in 27.1% of the moderate drinkers, in 38.3% of the heavy
      drinkers, and in 76.3% of the alcoholic women. Fetal alcohol effects developed in
      42 cases. Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase predicted fetal alcohol effects in
      61.5%, with a relative risk of 2.51. Elevated mean cell volume predicted fetal
      alcohol effects in 40.9%, with a relative risk of 2.40. These results suggest
      that the assay of gamma-glutamyl transferase and mean cell volume can be valuable
      in monitoring pregnant women with recognized or suspected alcohol abuse.

      pregnant women with alcohol abuse.
PG  - 153-6
AB  - Serum estradiol, estriol, progesterone, PRL, and hCG concentrations were measured
      at 4-week intervals in 40 pregnant women who chronically abused alcohol and in 20
      abstinent pregnant women. Sixteen alcohol users gave birth to infants with the
      fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), whereas the remaining 24 infants of alcohol users
      and all infants of the abstinent women were healthy. The women whose infants had 
      the FAS had decreased estradiol and estriol levels throughout pregnancy.
      Progesterone levels also tended to be low. In contrast, the alcohol users had
      increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy compared with those in
      the abstinent women, but this rise was not related to the FAS. The concentrations
      of hCG fluctuated widely, without any consistent difference between alcohol users
      and abstinent women. Thus, heavy maternal abuse of alcohol resulting in FAS is
      accompanied, primarily or secondarily, by reduced estrogen concentrations
      throughout pregnancy and increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of
      pregnancy.

AB  - In a clinical and follow-up study of the progeny of alcoholic parents the author 
      investigated embryopathic/dysontogenetic disorders ("oligosymptomatic" forms of
      alcoholic embryopathy, mental infantilism, hyperdynamic syndrome and the syndrome
      of cerebrospinal fluid hypertension) exerting a pathoplastic effect on the
      deviant behaviour of adolescents. The author has developed approaches toward a
      multiple modality therapy and rehabilitation of these patients in conditions of a
      special school for adolescents with deviant behaviour. A hypothesis is advanced
      as to the relationship between embryopathic/dysontogenetic disorders with
      embryofetotoxic effect of the mother's alcoholism on the fetus during pregnancy.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and infant behavior: immediate effects and implications
      for later development.
PG  - 87-104
AB  - Infants exposed to alcohol prenatally, even when they do not suffer from fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS), may be at high risk for many of the negative outcomes
      typically found among children of alcoholics including hyperactivity and other
      behavioral and learning problems. A series of studies are described designed to
      investigate the incidence and persistence of central nervous system (CNS) related
      behavioral alterations in three groups of infants born to low SES black women:
      (1) those who never drank in pregnancy; (2) those who drank at an average of 12
      ounces of absolute alcohol (AA) per week throughout pregnancy; and (3) those who 
      drank an equivalent amount but stopped by the second trimester of pregnancy. Only
      healthy, full-term infants were examined for the physical dysmorphic features
      associated with FAS and for behavioral alterations that could be assessed using
      the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. One hundred and three
      neonates were examined at three days; those who had been exposed to alcohol were 
      found to be less optimal in neurobehavioral responses. Infants whose mothers
      continued to drink were significantly lower on their orientation toward auditory 
      and visual stimuli, motor performance, and autonomic regulation than the
      nonexposed infants. Although a second study found that some of these effects were
      related to neonatal withdrawal syndrome, a follow-up to 30 days of age in a
      subsample of the original group found that there were persistent behavioral
      alterations. Infants in the stopped-drinking group showed more recovery over the 
      first month than did those in the continued-drinking group in reflexive behavior 
      and autonomic control. A reassessment at six months of 60 of the infants who had 
      been tested at three days indicated that differences in orientation, motor
      performance, reflexive behavior and autonomic control were predictive of mental
      and motor performance on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. This series of 
      studies supports the contention that the negative effects on infant behavior of
      prenatal alcohol exposure are both immediate and persistent.

      is presented. Issues having special relevance to children of alcoholics are
      discussed, including: prevention (identification of subjects at risk, public
      recommendations about drinking and pregnancy, child abuse and neglect); treatment
      (reaching treatment professionals, parental consent, confidentiality, third-party
      coverage, early intervention), and research.

TI  - Ocular involvement in the fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 277-84
AB  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes malformations of the eyes with
      serious consequences to the vision of the affected children. A high percentage
      (up to 90%) of children suffering from the fetal alcohol syndrome have eye
      abnormalities, including malformation in the outer eye region, disorders of
      motility, and defects of different intraocular structures. Two kinds of
      malformations stand out as most typical--hypoplasia of the optic nervehead (up to
      48%) and increased tortuosity of the retinal vessels, especially of the arteries 
      (up to 49%). Visual acuity is often moderately or severely reduced. Considering
      the developmental timing of different tissues of the eye, one can presume that
      there is a risk for deleterious effects of alcohol on eye structures at any point
      of time from early gestation until development is completed.

TI  - Perceptions of risks of smoking and heavy drinking during pregnancy: 1985 NHIS
      findings.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - As part of the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Questionnaire administered
      in the 1985 National Health Interview Survey, nearly 20,000 respondents ages
      18-44 answered questions about their awareness of the risks of smoking and heavy 
      drinking during pregnancy. In reference to smoking, interviewers asked about
      miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, and low birth weight; in reference to heavy
      drinking, they asked about miscarriage, mental retardation, low birth weight, and
      birth defects, as well as fetal alcohol syndrome. For each of these adverse
      outcomes, a majority of subjects acknowledged increased risk because of smoking
      or heavy drinking during pregnancy. The range was 66-80 percent of respondents
      for the four questions on smoking, with the perceived association to smoking
      strongest for low birth weight. Approximately 84 percent of respondents
      associated heavy drinking with increased risk for each of the suggested pregnancy
      outcomes. Smoking seemed to be perceived to pose a lesser risk to pregnancy than 
      heavy drinking. This relative lack of awareness of the pregnancy risks of smoking
      was more apparent among respondents with less education and more pronounced among
      blacks than whites. Women were more likely than men to express some opinion on
      these pregnancy-related questions and were more cognizant than men of the risks. 
      On this limited survey, Americans ages 18-44 were not very knowledgeable about
      fetal alcohol syndrome. Among the 55 percent who had heard of fetal alcohol
      syndrome, fewer than one in four correctly identified it as a set of birth
      defects when offered three possible definitions. It will be interesting to
      correlate responses to these "knowledge" questions with NHIS data still
      forthcoming on reported actual smoking and drinking behavior among women
      respondents who were recently pregnant.

AB  - Several questions in the 1985 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
      Questionnaire, which was part of the 1985 National Health Interview Survey,
      addressed respondents' consumption of alcohol. Sociodemographic characteristics, 
      knowledge of health risks related to heavy drinking, health practices, and the
      prevalence of certain health conditions were examined in relation to drinking
      levels. Although cause-effect relationships should not be inferred from the
      associations, the findings suggest some provocative areas for prevention and
      research. Heavier drinkers were more commonly found among men than women. Level
      of drinking was associated positively with years of education and family income, 
      but was inversely related to age. Compared with light drinkers, heavier drinkers 
      were much more likely to drive after they had had too much to drink. While more
      than 90 percent of the population knew that heavier drinking increases the risk
      of 'liver cirrhosis, less than half knew about the increased risk of throat
      cancer and cancer of the mouth. Most respondents aged 18-44 years (80 percent or 
      more) knew that heavy drinking increases the chance of adverse pregnancy
      outcomes, and more women than men (62 versus 49 percent) had heard of fetal
      alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, 70 percent or more of those who had heard of FAS
      described the syndrome as a newborn addicted to alcohol rather than a child born 
      with certain birth defects. Heavier drinkers of both sexes were less likely than 
      others to be nonsmokers, and moderate drinkers were more likely than others to
      exercise or play sports regularly. Moderate drinkers also tended to have lower
      lifetime prevalence rates than others for hypertension and heart trouble.

AB  - To determine the usefulness of the assays of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein,
      human placental lactogen, and pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein in prenatal 
      diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome, these proteins were followed in 35 problem
      drinkers (greater than 100 gm of ethanol weekly) and in 14 abstinent women
      throughout gestation. Thirteen women gave birth to infants with fetal alcohol
      syndrome, and these women had low levels of alpha-fetoprotein and
      pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein but levels of human placental lactogen
      were normal. Low alpha-fetoprotein correctly predicted fetal alcohol syndrome in 
      59% with a relative risk of 2.46. Low pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein
      predicted fetal alcohol syndrome in 56%, and a relative risk was 3.29. Low
      alpha-fetoprotein and pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein may reflect primary 
      or secondary effects of ethanol abuse in pregnancy and appear to be useful in
      predicting fetal alcohol syndrome.

AB  - The authors examined 75 mothers suffering from alcoholism with regard to risk
      factors for their progeny. When children had psychological pathology, the
      mothers' alcoholism was distinguished by greater severity of biological
      manifestations and relatively easier social sequelae. A peculiar nature of the
      alcoholism course, along with the alcohol doses taken by the mothers during
      pregnancy, determined the birth of children with the syndrome of alcoholic
      embryopathy. The appearance of children with neurotic and psychopathic
      disturbances reflects the polymorphism of the psychogenic effect of maternal
      alcoholism. A multifactorial effect of the mother's alcoholism on her progeny is 
      postulated and practical recommendations based on this postulation are offered.

AB  - In order to investigate prospectively the relationship between maternal serum
      levels of a biologic marker of alcohol and the outcome of pregnancy, we measured 
      serum gamma-glutamyltransferase in 541 women between 14 and 20 weeks of
      pregnancy. An abnormally elevated value was observed in 6.8% of the cases but
      only 16.2% of these suspected alcohol abusers admitted drinking practices during 
      pregnancy. Analysis of obstetrical issue and blind examination of the newborns
      showed a significant correlation between raised gamma-glutamyltransferase levels 
      and an increased incidence of pre-/perinatal complications, congenital anomalies 
      and intrauterine growth retardation. However, the sensitivity of this test is
      weak, limiting its use in the early recognition and prevention of fetal alcohol
      effects.

AB  - To determine the neurobehavioral consequences of alcohol use during different
      periods in gestation, we compared the behavior of 103 neonates born to women who:
      drank a mean of 12 ounces of absolute alcohol per week throughout pregnancy;
      drank a mean of 14 ounces of absolute alcohol and were otherwise comparable to
      the first group but stopped drinking in the second trimester, and never drank at 
      all during pregnancy. Low socioeconomic status, predominantly black women
      applying for prenatal care at a large inner city hospital were recruited in the
      second trimester of pregnancy, and those reporting alcohol use were advised to
      stop drinking. Neurobehavioral evaluation with the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral 
      Assessment Scale was conducted at 3 days postnatal age. As a group, infants
      exposed to alcohol at any time during gestation were found to have significant
      alterations in reflexive behavior, less mature motor behavior, and an increased
      activity level in comparison to unexposed infants. Infants whose mothers stopped 
      drinking in the second trimester were superior to those whose mothers continued
      to drink throughout pregnancy in observed state control, need for stimulation,
      motor tone, tremulousness, and asymmetries in reflexive behavior. These results
      indicate that characteristic damage does occur to the central nervous system of a
      fetus exposed to alcohol throughout pregnancy, and that exposure during only the 
      early part of pregnancy also seems to have measurable effects. Multivariate
      analysis indicated that neither amount of alcohol used per week nor cigarette use
      contributed significantly to these effects on infant behavior.

      of symptoms occurring in alcoholic embryopathy. We are not able to answer the
      question whether the stippled epiphyses in our case are due to the maternal
      alcoholism or part of a mild form of chondrodysplasia punctata.

TI  - Prospective study of children exposed to variable amounts of alcohol in utero.
PG  - 316-21
AB  - Forty children exposed to variable amounts of alcohol in utero and 40 control
      children were studied. All mothers had been enrolled in an antenatal programme
      aiming to identify and reduce alcohol use and abuse during pregnancy. Follow up
      was at the median age of 22 (18 to 27) months. A significant reduction in
      intrauterine growth was seen in children born to alcoholic mothers. Three of six 
      children continuously exposed to high amounts of alcohol throughout fetal life
      showed growth retardation and physical abnormalities characteristic of fetal
      alcohol exposure, while infants whose mothers had stopped drinking did not suffer
      these effects. Psychological or behavioural disturbances were found in all but
      one of 13 children born to alcoholic mothers. The home environment during the
      first two years did not compensate for the effects of fetal alcohol exposure.
      Mothers classified as excessive drinkers but not abusers all reduced their
      alcohol consumption after the first trimester. Their children did not differ from
      controls with regard to physical development or behaviour but many were retarded 
      in speech and, in addition had a more unstable family background.

AB  - Analysis of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption patterns recorded in
      pregnancy could not detect a harmful effect of alcohol at levels below 2 glasses 
      a day. Total abstainers fared very slightly worse than those who drank
      occasionally. Smoking was associated with lower birth-weight and a worse fetal
      outcome independent of socioeconomic status, parity, maternal age or alcohol
      consumption. There was evidence of an interaction between smoking and adverse
      social and parity factors in low birth-weight.

OAB - PIP: Fetal outcome in all 15,000 births occurring in Tanzania in 1981-82 was
      analyzed on the basis of alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, parity,
      socioeconomic status, and maternal age. Smokers tended to be concentrated in the 
      lower socioeconomic groups, whereas alcohol consumption was more prevalent among 
      women of higher socioeconomic status. The data failed to suggest any harmful
      effects on the fetus of alcohol consumption at levels below 2 glasses/day.
      Moreover, the infants of total abstainers were slightly lighter at birth than
      those of mothers who drank occasionally. On the other hand, infants of mothers
      who drank 2 or more glasses of alcohol/day were an average of 300 gm smaller than
      those of abstainers. There was no evidence of an association between congenital
      malformations and alcohol consumption, even among the heaviest drinkers. In
      contrast, the relationship between cigarette smoking and low birth weight was
      significant. The incidence of low birth weight (2.5 kg) deliveries increased from
      3.3% among nonsmokers to 5.7% among light smokers to 8.1% among moderate smokers 
      and to 10% among heavy smokers. Controlling for parity, socioeconomic status,
      gestational age at delivery, and alcohol consumption failed to eliminate the 200 
      gm birth weight difference between infants of smokers and nonsmokers. However,
      there was evidence of an interaction between smoking and adverse social and
      parity factors in low birth weight. Considering problems encountered in
      convincing women to give up smoking during pregnancy, it is recommended that
      preventive campaigns be directed at women of childbearing age who have not yet
      taken up the habit.

AB  - Pregnant DBA/1J mice were treated orally with 1.0 or 2.0 g/kg ethanol from days
      11-17 of gestation to determine whether ethanol can perturb normal brain
      development. On gestational day 18 the fetuses were removed and fetal growth
      parameters were determined. The cerebrums from one group of fetuses were
      subsequently analyzed for cell number and protein content. The remaining
      cerebrums were assayed for their ability to grow in an in vitro cell culture
      system. Prenatal ethanol exposure decreased fetal body and brain weights and
      crown-rump length. The brain was particularly affected as indicated by a
      decreased brain: body wt ratio. The percentage of affected and marginally
      affected fetuses increased in a dose-dependent manner. While the number of
      cells/brain was unaffected, the number of cells/g cerebrum and the number of
      cells/mg cerebral protein was increased. Prenatal ethanol exposure decreased the 
      ability of cerebral cells to grow in culture as demonstrated by the reduced
      plating efficiency and reduced colony size. The data from the present study
      suggest that ethanol induces a two-fold effect on mouse brain development. First,
      since the total number of cells/brain was not appreciably affected by prenatal
      ethanol treatment, it is possible that the reduction in brain size is due to a
      decreased amount of neuropil. This putative effect on the neuropil was manifested
      in vitro by decreased colony area. Second, the decreased plating efficiency of
      cells from brains of affected fetuses suggests that these cells are not
      functionally normal. These effects may be important in the pathogenesis of
      central nervous system anomalies associated with the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

AB  - Heavy alcohol consumption (more than 80 g per day) in pregnancy is associated
      with the foetal alcohol syndrome. More moderate consumption is reported to result
      in increased rates of spontaneous abortion, still birth and congenital
      malformation as well as growth retardation. There may be functional deficits in
      early childhood. In the light of current knowledge abstinence from alcohol before
      and during pregnancy is advisable.

      women, the 21 youngest born 1970-76, were paired to controls matched for sex,
      age, birth weight, gestational age and living area. IQ scores were measured with 
      Griffiths and WISC scales. Controls tested within the normal range for Swedish
      children, while the study group scored 15-19 IQ points below controls (p less
      than 0.01), the means of the study group corresponding to -1.6 SD below means of 
      the controls. Significant differences between the groups were found in all
      subscales. Visual perception was measured with Frostig's test. Perceptual age was
      generally equal to mental age except in the most severely affected cases where
      perceptional age was lower than mental age. A marked perceptual delay exceeding 1
      year was found in 8/17 tested cases in the study group, while all controls were
      normal. Developmental levels evaluated from Human Figure Drawings according to
      Koppitz was in accordance with IQ test results. Indicators of emotional
      instability were found significantly more often in the study group than in
      controls. Hyperactivity, distractability and short attention span were found in
      12/21 cases and perseveration in 6/21 cases but not among controls. Members of
      the study group with traits of the fetal alcohol syndrome (10/21) had
      significantly lower IQ and perceptual delay was more pronounced than in members
      without such signs. No significant IQ difference was found between subjects
      reared in foster homes and in biological homes.

      age. The sample (10 girls, 11 boys) was representative of the whole group with
      regard to weight, length and head circumference at birth. At follow-up (mean age 
      70 months) the study group was significantly leaner, shorter and had smaller mean
      head circumference than the control group. The controls had significant catch-up 
      growth from birth to follow-up of weight, height and head circumference to the
      mean for Swedish children. The study group had no catch-up growth. Compared to
      controls the study group had significantly lower fine and gross motor age test
      scores and inferior coordination. One child had cerebral palsy (spastic
      hemiplegia) and in 6 other children slight tremor and ataxia were observed.
      Malformations and/or other signs of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were found
      in 10 cases. Study group children with FAS had significantly slower growth of
      head circumference than others without FAS. Children placed in foster home care
      (n = 11) were found to have significantly (p less than 0.05) lower birth weight, 
      birth length and head circumference than children raised at home (n = 10). There 
      were no significant differences at follow up between study group children raised 
      in foster homes or in homes of their biological mother.

TI  - Reliability of retrospective estimates of alcohol consumption during pregnancy by

PG  - 86-8
AB  - Twenty-six recovering women alcoholics were interviewed concerning their alcohol 
      consumption during a pregnancy prior to their recovery. Several months later they
      were reinterviewed. Test-retest correlations were found to be high. Reliability
      was not related to the length of time since the pregnancy or to the test-retest
      interval. The frequency of consumption reported did not differ significantly from
      test to retest. However, the reported amount of consumption per occasion was
      significantly lower at the second interview. Reports of binge drinking were
      particularly unreliable. Results should be interpreted cautiously because the
      sample size was small. Although it may not be possible to estimate accurately
      actual alcohol consumption, it is possible to rank-order consumption reliably. It
      is not known whether these results may be generalized to other populations of
      pregnant women alcoholics, or to nonpregnant women and men.

      cases].
PG  - 547-50
AB  - The authors report 7 cases of chondrodysplasia punctata in whom maternal alcohol 
      intoxication was found. Most often, it consisted of chronic and confirmed
      alcoholism, except for the last case, in which an acute intoxication had occurred
      at about the 4th or 5th week of pregnancy. Clinically, the appearance of the
      children was evocative of fetal alcohol syndrome, except in the last case when,
      in contrast, the facial dysmorphy was very typical of chondrodysplasia punctata. 
      The skeletal anomalies preferentially involve the lower limbs, sometimes the
      sacrum, and in one single case, the dorsal spine. Upper limbs are always spared. 
      The maternal hepatic lesions may be responsible for the skeletal impairment, due 
      to their repercussion on the metabolism of vitamin K. This skeletal impairment
      would then be close to that induced by treatments with warfarin during pregnancy.
      Whatever, it is absolutely necessary to X-ray the lower limbs in cases with fetal
      alcohol syndrome, in order to not overlook associated bone lesions.

TI  - Neonatal ethanol withdrawal: characteristics in clinically normal, nondysmorphic 
      neonates.
PG  - 445-51
AB  - Although neonatal withdrawal syndrome is often noted in infants of narcotics
      addicts, ethanol withdrawal has been reported only among neonates with fetal
      alcohol syndrome. To examine the possibility that ethanol withdrawal occurs more 
      widely and to identify its characteristics, the behavior of eight neonates born
      to women who drank a mean of 21 ounces of absolute alcohol per week during
      gestation was compared with that of two contrast groups: 15 infants whose mothers
      drank an equivalent amount but stopped in the second trimester, and 29 infants
      whose mothers never drank. None of the 52 infants had fetal alcohol syndrome, and
      all were in good health. Neurobehavioral evaluation 3 days postnatally compared
      the groups for the occurrence of characteristic signs of withdrawal from central 
      nervous system depressants. Whereas there was no difference in the frequency of
      withdrawal symptoms among infants of mothers who never drank (mean 1.4) or of
      mothers who stopped drinking (mean 1.8), infants of mothers who continued to
      drink (mean 4.7) had significantly more tremors, hypertonia, restlessness,
      excessive mouthing movements, unconsolable crying, and reflex abnormalities. By
      interfering with state control and interactive behaviors, withdrawal could affect
      mother-infant bonding as well as the conditions that foster cognitive and social 
      development.

TI  - Drinking and reproductive dysfunction among women in a 1981 national survey.
PG  - 451-8
AB  - This paper presents the first data available on drinking and reproductive
      dysfunction from a representative national sample of women. In this stratified
      household sample of 917 women (weighted n = 2552), dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual 
      flow, and premenstrual discomfort increased with drinking level and were
      particularly strongly associated with reported consumption of 6 or more drinks a 
      day at least once a week. Women who consumed 6 or more drinks/day at least 5
      times a week had elevated rates of gynecologic surgery other than hysterectomy,
      but hysterectomy was less common among women averaging 2 oz or more of
      ethanol/day, with age effects controlled. Lifetime rates of obstetric disorders
      showed significant elevations at upper levels of drinking (6 or more drinks/day
      at least 3 times a week for miscarriage or stillbirth and prematurity, and 6 or
      more drinks/day at least 5 times a week for infertility and birth defects). An
      unexpected finding was the high rates of menstrual disorders, hysterectomy,
      miscarriage or stillbirth, and prematurity among temporary abstainers (women
      reporting alcohol consumption in the past 12 months but not the past 30 days) who
      had previously drunk only infrequently.

TI  - A semiquantitative score system for epidemiologic studies of fetal alcohol
      syndrome.
PG  - 301-8
AB  - A total of 464 children of 323 women registered for alcoholism treatment in
      Budapest, Hungary, were studied in 1977-1979. A complex epidemiologic
      investigation was carried out using medical, psychological and anthropological
      data. The data were evaluated on the basis of a semiquantitative diagnostic
      scoring system for fetal alcohol syndrome. The score distribution curve for 301
      children whose mothers imbibed during pregnancy was statistically significantly
      different from the score distribution curve for 163 children born to alcoholic
      mothers who remained abstinent during pregnancy and from the curve for a matched 
      control group of 464 children. A significant difference was also found between
      the score distribution curves for the latter two groups. Twenty-five children of 
      301 drinkers (8.3%) scored below -30 points and were said to show typical
      manifestations of the syndrome. All of the mothers in this group imbibed large
      amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. A further 205 children of 464 alcoholic
      mothers (44.2%) scored between -30 and -10 points and were diagnosed as having an
      atypical form of the syndrome. Among the 205 children, 168 were the offspring of 
      301 drinkers (55.8%) and 37 were the offspring of 163 alcoholic females who were 
      abstinent during pregnancy (22.7%). A stepwise discriminant analysis showed the
      best discriminating variables--in order of entry into the discriminant
      functions--to be current weight, nose-upper lip distance, behavioral disturbance 
      (irritability), root of the nose, intelligence quotient, and palpebral fissure.
      The most important cause of fetal alcohol syndrome is the direct toxic effect of 
      alcohol on the fetus.

TI  - Drinking amongst pregnant women: some initial results from a prospective study.
PG  - 153-7
AB  - A review is presented of the characteristics of the foetal alcohol syndrome
      (FAS). It is noted that in its most extreme form the FAS encompasses both
      physical and mental abnormalities. Some of the initial results are briefly
      presented from the first two phases of a Scottish prospective study. This relates
      to the patterns of alcohol use and misuse of 1008 pregnant women. These data
      indicate that self-reported alcohol consumption was slightly but significantly
      correlated with previous obstetric problems. In addition, a minority of the study
      group, due to their levels of alcohol consumption, may run an increased risk of
      giving birth to abnormal offspring. It is concluded that on the basis of current 
      evidence those planning or experiencing pregnancy should be advised not to drink.

TI  - Neuropsychological deficits in alcoholics: etiological considerations.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - The literature on the causes of neuropsychological deficits (NDs) in alcoholics
      is reviewed. It is asserted that NDs are caused not simply by the neurotoxicity
      of alcohol but by the interrelationships of various factors. NDs might thus
      reflect problems antecedent to or concomitant with alcoholism and not just the
      consequences of alcohol use. The family histories of alcoholics have shown that a
      differential susceptibility to NDs might have a genetic basis. NDs might also be 
      due to the fetal alcohol syndrome. Children who eventually become alcoholics have
      been shown to be more impulsive and hyperactive than other children, factors
      related to NDs. There seem to be multiple pathways leading to NDs--two ND
      syndromes, an acceleration of the normal aging process and an amnesic syndrome,
      seem to be a consequence of alcoholism. Depression and sociopathy are
      independently related to both alcoholism and NDs, so causal attributions are
      difficult to determine. The contribution of head injury to NDs in alcoholics
      might also be important. NDs in alcoholics suffering from liver disease seem to
      be caused in part by the liver disease and not the alcoholism per se. Liver
      disease is also associated with nutritional deficiencies which, in turn, can
      produce certain NDs. Dysfunction in several neurological mechanisms has been
      shown to be related to alcohol consumption. However, neuronal metabolism,
      metabolizing enzymes, membrane permeability, neurotransmitters, endocrine
      function, cerebrovascular pathology and cerebrospinal pathology have not been
      found to be related to NDs. The effect of congeners has not been
      investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Forty children with the fetal alcohol syndrome were identified in the west of
      Scotland. All were growth retarded and had abnormal facial features, and all
      those who were tested were found to have neurological or developmental
      abnormalities. Two children died of associated physical defects. Most of the
      mothers were socially deprived, and all had drunk heavily while pregnant. Three
      women had subsequently died. These findings provide clear evidence that in the
      west of Scotland maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy is a significant cause
      of morbidity and mortality in children.

AB  - Twenty children affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol are described. Their
      mothers either suffered from chronic alcoholism, or were binge or heavy drinkers 
      while pregnant. Only in nine mothers (45%) was alcohol abuse recognized and
      associated with their babies' anomalies in the first months after birth; in some,
      the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome was delayed for many years. Alcohol abuse
      in pregnancy is probably a significant cause of birth and developmental defects
      in Australian children.

PG  - 716-24
AB  - Changes in the drinking and smoking habits of pregnant women in Seattle,
      Washington, were examined in the 6-year period that followed the first American
      announcement of the fetal alcohol syndrome. Between 1974/1975 and 1980/1981, the 
      number of women who reported any alcohol use around the time of the first
      prenatal visit dropped from 81% to 42%, whereas the number of smokers dropped
      from 25% to 22%; binge and heavier drinking also declined. However, among
      drinkers, there was no decrease in the proportion of women who reported heavier
      drinking. Although the proportion of women who drink during pregnancy has
      decreased in the past 6 years, the relative constancy in the proportion of
      "heavier" drinkers and binge drinkers, particularly around the time of
      conception, suggests the need for more attention to this important period of
      gestation in advice to women who are planning a pregnancy. Possible reasons for
      such changes in this particular community are discussed.

TI  - Alcoholic women in fertile age treated at an alcohol clinic.
PG  - 195-204
AB  - The consumption of alcohol by women in Sweden is strongly increasing, especially 
      in younger individuals. Since the rediscovery of the teratological properties of 
      alcohol most of the studies concerning foetal alcohol damage in man have covered 
      female skid row alcoholics. This investigation describes the medical and social
      characteristics of a group of women (n = 92) receiving inpatient care for
      alcoholism compared with an age-matched control group, in relation to obstetrical
      history. The conditions in the control group were in accord with those of the
      general population. Social problems and degree of alcoholism were noticeably
      advanced among the probands. The proband women who gave birth after established
      regular alcohol consumption were younger, showed more psychiatric complications
      during the treatment period, had started drinking and developing signs of
      advanced alcoholism earlier in life compared with probands who gave birth before 
      established regular alcohol consumption. They also exhibited more social
      disturbances. The social problems caused by the mothers' alcohol abuse are
      expected to aggravate the biological consequences to their children.

TI  - Children of alcoholics.
PG  - 3-8
AB  - The familial nature of alcoholism is well established, but the interaction of
      nature and nurture remains unresolved. Other effects of alcoholic parents on the 
      psychopathology of their children are poorly documented, with studies variably
      claiming that there is no discernible impact or that there is a significantly
      higher incidence of problems, particularly in the area of antisocial and
      aggressive behaviour. The relative importance of family disharmony and disruption
      which so often accompanies alcohol abuse, as against the impact of the alcohol
      abuse itself, is rarely considered. The literature on the psychopathology of
      children of alcoholic parents is reviewed and the relevance of the last two
      issues explored.

TI  - [The incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome].
PG  - 96-9
AB  - In contrast to the wellknown picture of the "fetal alcohol syndrome" (FAS),
      clinical symptoms of the incomplete FAS are less frequently recognized compared
      to the high incidence of the syndrome as stated in the literature. The diagnostic
      problem is a clear differentiation between mild forms of the incomplete FAS and
      clinical normality. Post-natal growth deficiency and microcephaly of unknown
      aetiology, clinical symptoms of hyperactivity, learning disabilities or mild
      mental retardation are the main features of the incomplete FAS. The diagnosis is 
      established only by a positive history of maternal alcohol abuse.

AB  - A congenital alcoholic syndrome (CAS) belongs to rarely diagnosed embryopathies .
      It consists of polysymptomatic misdevelopings in numerous organs of the fetus
      caused by alcoholic abuse through the mother during the pregnancy. The diagnosis 
      of the CAS is established on the basis of following topics: the anamnesis
      confirming the chronic alcoholism of baby's mother, the excluding of congenital
      genetic defects and intrauterine infections as well as qualitative and
      quantitative feeding deficits. In the differential diagnosis should be taken
      congenital cranial and facial dysmorphies which are most often seen in many
      syndromes such as: Pierre-Robin, Treacher-Collins, Weyer , Franceschetti -
      Zwahlen . In the presented paper there is described one case of the CAS observed 
      during 15 months clinically and radiologically.

TI  - Management of severe feeding dysfunction in children with fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 336-9
AB  - In the past three years, we have seen three children who required prolonged
      inpatient admissions for severe feeding dysfunction resulting in nutritional and 
      growth problems. The pregnancies were significant for severe maternal alcohol
      abuse during the entire pregnancy. All of the subjects had multiple physical
      findings and dysmorphic features seen in children with mild to severe fetal
      alcohol syndrome. Feeding evaluations showed significant delays in oral motor
      development. Specific oral motor dysfunction was not a commonality and did not
      appear to be a major determinant in delays in feeding development. Continued
      assessment revealed that the babies had limited suck patterns and were
      consistently noted to tire easily. Each required feeding by either gastrostomy
      and/or nasogastric feeding for prolonged periods of time. They started initial
      feeding by mouth at about 8 to 10 months. The times for complete oral feeding
      were 14, 17 and 18 months.

AB  - Extended psychiatric and pediatric examinations were performed on patients with
      the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). A subgroup of these patients underwent
      psychological testing to measure intelligence, visual perception, and
      psycholinguistic abilities. Psychopathology was also studied in a matched control
      group. The investigation revealed a broad scale of developmental hazards and
      psychopathologic symptoms indicating the negative long-range effects of alcohol
      abuse during pregnancy. The extent of morphologic damage was found to be a good
      predictor of psychopathology and mental impairment. Social environment and
      socioeconomic status appear less important as predictors.

TI  - Effects of alcohol on the fetus: impact and prevention.
PG  - 159-64
AB  - In the spectrum of adverse effects on the fetus or infant associated with
      maternal drinking during pregnancy the most dramatic is the fetal alcohol
      syndrome, a pattern of malformation that has been associated with maternal
      alcohol abuse. Other undesirable outcomes of pregnancy linked to alcohol exposure
      in utero include growth deficiency, major and minor anomalies, decrements in
      mental and motor performance, and fetal and perinatal wastage. Alcohol, like
      other teratogens, does not uniformly affect all those exposed to it. Rather,
      there seems to be a continuum of effects of alcohol on the fetus with
      increasingly severe outcomes generally associated with higher intakes of alcohol 
      by the mother. The cost of fetal damage associated with alcohol exposure is very 
      high. A program to decrease the incidence of fetal alcohol effects is therefore
      imperative. The cornerstone of such a program must be not only education of the
      public but also careful training of all professionals who provide health care for
      pregnant women.

PG  - 1237-9
AB  - A study of Hogarth's engraving, Gin Lane, highlights the fact that alcoholic
      addiction parents results not only in the fetal alcohol syndrome, but also in
      other types of infant abuse. Physical trauma, loss of parents, neglect, and
      malnutrition are all depicted. There is the strong implication that the causes of
      such infant abuse, and thus the prevention, lie largely in socioeconomic and
      cultural fields, rather than in that of medical science.

TI  - Zinc status of pregnant alcoholic women: a determinant of fetal outcome.
PG  - 572-51
AB  - The zinc status of 25 alcoholic and 25 non-alcoholic pregnant women was measured 
      and correlated with fetal outcome. The volume index of alcohol consumption and
      the Michigan Alcoholic Screening Test were used to define alcoholic women. The
      alcoholic women had significantly lower plasma-zinc levels that the non-alcoholic
      women (50.7 versus 72.2 micrograms/dl). Fetal cord-plasma zinc levels were also
      lower in the offspring of alcoholic women (65.5 versus 81.3 micrograms/dl).
      Manifestation of fetal dysmorphogenesis appears to relate to zinc status.

TI  - Strategies for prevention of fetal alcohol effects.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The effects of alcohol on the fetus include a wide range of problems; the
      complete fetal alcohol syndrome is the extreme end of the spectrum. At critical
      doses alcohol has the potential for multiple adverse effects on the
      maternal--placental--fetal system. Variability of outcome probably is related to 
      individual differences in drinking patterns as well as in biologic
      susceptibility. At Boston City Hospital Prenatal Clinic, therapy was provided for
      pregnant women who reported drinking heavily. Reduction in maternal alcohol
      consumption before the third trimester was associated with improved neonatal
      outcome. The obstetrician's office is a potential site for prevention programs. A
      10-question drinking history enables physicians to identify pregnant women at
      risk. Supportive counseling focused on reduction of alcohol use can be integrated
      with regular prenatal care. Pregnant women who do not respond promptly should be 
      referred to specialized treatment programs. This strategy has the potential to
      improve the health of both mother and infant.

PG  - 183-5
AB  - This study investigates contingent negative variation (CNV) in ten children
      diagnosed as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and ten control children whose mothers 
      reported only infrequent drinking during pregnancy. Cortical potentials were
      obtained using a procedure similar to Cohen's (1976) design. Stimuli consisted of
      a randomly presented flash followed 1.5 sec later by a tone. Sixty-four trials
      were presented with tone offset under experimenter control. For the next 128
      trials, the subject pushed a button to turn off the tone. The EEG was recorded
      from Cz, P3, and P4 referred to linked earlobes. In addition, a resting EEG was
      obtained prior to the start of the trials. Cortical potentials were averaged
      separately over the two sets of trials and measures of slope and integrated
      amplitude obtained. Preliminary analysis showed that four of ten FAS children had
      negative slopes while eight of ten control children had negative slopes. These
      differences between groups, while in the predicted direction, were not
      statistically significant. Additional analyses are in progress.

AB  - There are several factors which might increase the risk for Fetal Alcohol
      Syndrome in Native American groups. Culture influences, fertility, patterns of
      alcohol consumption and abuse, and perhaps dietary and metabolic differences may 
      be involved. The suspicion of increased occurrence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in
      the Indian population is presently based upon incomplete or anecdotal evidence,
      but studies are now underway to define actual prevalence rates in some of these
      groups.

PG  - 978-82
AB  - Children referred to the Learning Disorders Unit of the Yale-New Haven Hospital
      were evaluated for indications of prenatal exposure to ethanol. In a total
      population of 87 children, 15 were found to have a history of maternal heavy
      drinking during pregnancy. The 11 boys and four girls ranged in age from 6 1/2 to
      18 1/2 years. Birth weights ranged from 1,580 to 3,150 gm, median weight 2,213
      gm. All growth measurements were affected: head circumference 60% less than tenth
      percentile, height 60% less than tenth percentile, weight 74% less than
      twenty-fifth percentile. The children had a continuum of dysmorphic features of
      FAS, with an inverse relationship noted between age of presentation and intensity
      of dysmorphic features. All had intelligence in the average range (IQ 82 to 113),
      yet experienced persistent academic failure. In addition, all shared problems of 
      activity and attention regulation. Our results suggest a continuum of teratogenic
      effects of ethanol on the CNS. Alcohol exposure in utero may be an important,
      preventable determinant of attention deficit syndromes in childhood.

PG  - 147-50
AB  - The author presents cases of dysmorphic children born to alcoholic mothers to
      illustrate his discussion of the "fetal alcohol syndrome". The fact that this
      malformative syndrome has not been recognized before 1968 is amazing,
      particularly if one considers the high frequency of alcohol addiction and the
      relative specificity of the birth defects making up the syndrome. Newborns from
      severely alcoholic mothers are small for date, microcephalic, and they have
      abnormal facial features, as well as an increased frequency of other
      malformations (heart, genitalia, extremities). Neurological and mental
      deficiencies are recognized early in most of these children. Central nervous
      system anomalies are beginning to be described by the neuropathologists, which
      correspond to these clinical findings.

TI  - Effects on the child of alcohol abuse during pregnancy. Retrospective and
      prospective studies.
PG  - 112-21
AB  - Retrospective and prospective investigations of children to alcoholic women gave 
      an incidence of fetal alcohol lesion of one per 300 deliveries of whom half had
      the complete fetal alcohol syndrome. Perinatal and infant mortalities were
      increased seven to tenfold and low birth weight (less than or equal to 2 500 g), 
      preterm deliveries (less than 37 weeks) and smallness for gestational age (less
      than -2 S.D.) were increased eightfold, threefold and twelvefold, respectively.
      Small size at birth correlated with reduced mental performance later in life, 58%
      had IQ below 85 and 19% below 70.8% had cerebral palsy. The incidence of cerebral
      palsy associated with maternal inebriety was 1/5 000 deliveries, i.e. every sixth
      case of cerebral palsy. Tracing of alcoholic women during pregnancy and treatment
      gave favourable effect on intrauterine growth when sobriety could be induced
      early in pregnancy but could not protect from functional brain disturbance
      measured by neurological performance and be evoked response
      electroencephalography. Damage to the fetus by alcohol is now the largest known
      health hazard by a noxious agent that is preventable.

TI  - The fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 571-4
AB  - Two unrelated children with the fetal alcohol syndrome are described. Features of
      the syndrome include mental deficiency, growth delay, and craniofacial, limb and 
      cardiac anomalies. The finding of this spectrum of abnormalities raises the
      possibility of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy. The deleterious effects of
      alcohol on the developing fetus are emphasized. In view of the high prevalence of
      alcoholism in this country the fetal syndrome must be regarded as a serious and
      preventable cause of morbidity.

PG  - 53-6
AB  - A brother and sister and described with malformations and handicaps consistent
      with both the Klippel-Feil Anomalad and the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The mother
      was known to be a chronic alcholic throughout both pregnancies. It is suggested
      that these anomalies are not purely fortuitous but rather that maternal
      alcoholism may cause errors in cervical vertebrae segmentation.

TI  - Growth hormone response in fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 703-6
AB  - In the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) there is severe physical growth retardation
      both prenatally and postnatally. Secretion of growth hormone (GH) after
      insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and arginine infusion was analysed in 5 cases of
      FAS to find out whether changes in GH secretion might account for the abnormal
      growth pattern. Results showed a normal or slight hyper-response of GH up to 150 
      ng/ml, and normal somatomedin activity in those blood samples with high GH level.
      It was concluded that the growth retardation in FAS is not caused by GH or
      somatomedin deficiencies.

TI  - Fetal alcohol syndrome in dizygotic twins.
PG  - 963-7
AB  - A pair of fraternal twins with stigmata of the fetal alcohol syndrome are
      described. Apparently differences in susceptibility to the dysmorphogenic
      influence of ethanol caused one twin to be more severely affected than the other 
      one. Both infants are growing poorly postnatally, and both are at risk for
      retarded development. Any evidence of the fetal alcohol syndrome, however,
      subtle, should be considered a warning of possible future developmental delay.
