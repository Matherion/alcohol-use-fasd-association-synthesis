N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) occurs in approximately 3 of 1,000 live births in the general population of the U.S. and is the leading known cause of mental retardation. The Midwest Regional Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Training Center (MRFASTC) surveyed 1,000 licensed occupational therapists (OT) of the American Occupational Therapists Association in a six-state Midwest region, including Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding FAS. Nearly 20% of the OTs responded. Of the respondents, nearly 94% regarded at least 1 drink per day as being 'heavy' in a pregnant woman. There was an increase in the number of respondents who thought it was acceptable to consume 1 drink or more with each advancing trimester of pregnancy. 92% of the OTs indicated a willingness to counsel a mother of a child having FAS, but 96% indicated a poor to fair ability to select valid and reliable assessment instruments for screening a child for FAS. Only 6% of the OT respondents indicated a good-excellent ability to conduct brief interventions on alcohol cessation for women. The data collectively indicate OTs possess similarities to other health care providers, including physicians and psychologists, in the misunderstanding or deficits of knowledge and skills associated with FAS and that they are largely unprepared to provide intervention for women 'at risk' for FAS, or to recognize correctly FAS in children. There is a demonstrated need, and desire, by the practicing OTs for continued education related to alcohol abuse associated with FAS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a preventable cause of developmental delay and growth failure. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the clinical features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the role of the general practitioner in prevention and management. DISCUSSION: Early diagnosis of and intervention for problems associated with FAS reduce adverse long term outcomes. Most health professionals have limited knowledge of FASD and lack confidence in the diagnosis and management of children with FASD. General practitioners have an important role in identifying women and children at risk of harm from alcohol and arranging referral for assessment and management when necessary. Educational materials for health professionals are currently under development.

T1  - Appraisal of neurobehavioral methods in environmental health research: The developing brain as a target for neurotoxic chemicals
A1  - Winneke G.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Psychological tests as developed and validated in the field of differential psychology have a longstanding tradition as tools to study individual differences. In clinical neuropsychology, global or more specific tests are used as neuropsychological tools in the differential diagnosis of various forms of brain damage or neurobehavioral dysfunction following chemical insults, such as mental sequelae of prenatal alcohol consumption by pregnant mothers (fetal alcohol syndrome) or of maternal thyroid deficiency during pregnancy. Psychometric tests are constructed to fulfill basic quality criteria, namely objectivity, reliability and validity. For strictly diagnostic purposes in individual cases they must also possess normative values based on representative reference groups. Intelligence tests or their developmental variants are often used as endpoints in environmental health research for studying neurodevelopmental adversity due to early exposure to neurotoxic chemicals in the environment. Intelligence as treated in psychology is a complex construct made up of specific cognitive functions which usually cover verbal, numerical and spatial skills, as well as perceptual speed, memory and reasoning. In this paper, case studies covering neurodevelopmental adversity of inorganic lead, of methylmercury and of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are reviewed, and the issue of postnatal behavioral sequelae of prenatal exposure is covered. In such observational studies precautions must be taken in order to avoid pitfalls of causative interpretation of associations between exposure and neurobehavioral outcome. This requires consideration of co-exposure and confounding. Important confounders considered in most modern developmental cohort studies are maternal intelligence and quality of the home environment. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

N2  - Using light and electron microscopy, the peculiarities of the formation of brain blood vessel structure were studied at the early stages of brain development in human embryos and fetuses, whose mothers took alcohol during the period of pregnancy. Computer morphometric methods with the application of Scion Image program of image analysis demonstrated that in fetuses subjected to prenatal alcohol exposure, at weeks 11 and 12 of development, the average absolute sectional area of blood vessels in the intermediate layer of the brain was diminished, while blood vessel relative area and number per unit area of section were increased as compared to similar values in control group. The process of differentiation of blood vessels into arterial and venous ones was shown to start since developmental week 10.

N2  - Evaluation of sensory processing function serves as a critical component of treatment planning and implementation of intervention in pediatric occupational therapy practice. We developed a Sensory Processing Scale for Monkeys (SPS-M), based on human tests, that measures behavioral responses to a series of tactile stimuli. This assessment has been used to assess sensory processing in adult rhesus monkeys exposed to prenatal alcohol, stress, or postnatal lead. Control monkeys from undisturbed pregnancies showed a habituation pattern, prenatally stressed monkeys showed sensitization, and prenatal alcohol-exposed monkeys showed relatively high responsiveness without habituation across trials. Lead-exposed monkeys showed sensitization compared to nonlead-exposed controls, and chelation reduced the sensitization in lead-exposed animals. Aversive responsiveness was associated with up-regulated striatal dopamine receptor binding measured with positron emission tomography.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Purpose: This article is a retrospective examination of environmental risk, language performance, and narrative discourse data from a clinical database of school-age children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Method: A case-defined diagnostic approach for measuring and reporting the full spectrum of disabilities in children with prenatal alcohol exposure is presented. Demographic, environmental, language, and social communication (as reflected by narrative discourse) data are reported for a large cohort of children with FASD between the ages of 6;0 (years;months) and 12;0. Results: Children with FASD are a heterogeneous group with varying levels of compromise. The data demonstrate a substantial comorbidity between the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and adverse caregiving environments. The data further reveal that school-age children with FASD often exhibit clinically meaningful deficits in language and social communication. Clinical Implication: Children with FASD may be particularly vulnerable to language and social communication deficits as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure and atypical or adverse social interactive experiences. Comprehensive assessment is recommended. Dynamic and functional assessment paradigms may document the language and social communicative deficits in children with FASD and other clinical populations with complex neurodevelopmental profiles. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

T1  - Neurobiology and neurodevelopmental impact of childhood traumatic stress and prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Henry J.

A1  - Black-Pond C.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Purpose: Research reveals that prenatal alcohol exposure and child trauma (i.e., abuse, neglect, sexual abuse) can have deleterious effects on child development across multiple domains. This study analyzed the impact on childhood neurodevelopment of prenatal alcohol exposure and postnatal traumatic experience compared to postnatal traumatic experience alone. Although the harmful effects of both have been well documented individually, there is no research documenting the concurrent effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and postnatal trauma on a child's developmental process. Method: Transdisciplinary assessment of the children included the core disciplines of medicine, speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, social work, and psychology. Medical examination, standardized developmental and intelligence testing, projective tools, parent questionnaires, and psychosocial interviews provided information in the primary developmental areas. Results: Findings indicated that children who had been exposed prenatally to alcohol along with postnatal traumatic experience had lower intelligence scores and more severe neurodevelopmental deficits in language, memory, visual processing, motor skills, and attention than did traumatized children without prenatal alcohol exposure, as well as greater oppositlonal/defiant behavior, inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and social problems. Clinical Implications: Successful teacher and speech-language pathologist interventions with traumatized children with prenatal alcohol exposure demand a paradigm shift that requires the development of new perspectives and ongoing training. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Understanding the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and supporting students
A1  - Green J.H.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) affect a significant number of children in this country. This article addresses diagnostic issues related to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other alcohol-related disabilities, discusses associated features and behaviors of FASD, and introduces interventions to support children with FASD in school settings. Methods: A comprehensive review of FAS and FASD literature as it relates to school functioning was conducted. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a broad range of negative developmental consequences, including deficits in cognitive and academic functioning, psychological disorders, behavioral problems, and difficulties with independent living. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure are at risk for a spectrum of difficulties at school. Conclusions: This topic is of considerable relevance to all professionals in a school setting, including teachers, administrators, school psychologists, special education providers, special service providers, and school nurses who interact with children who may be prenatally exposed to alcohol. Successful interventions will need to balance the use of environmental modifications, immediate and meaningful positive and negative consequences for behaviors, and opportunities to teach children skills to monitor and modify their behavior. © 2007, American School Health Association.

T1  - Neurocognitive and neurobehavioral impairments in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Recognition and assessment
A1  - Paley B.
A1  - O'Connor M.J.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) represent a continuum of development disabilities associated with maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. This spectrum of disorders, which includes the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), is characterized by a wide range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. Estimates of the number of live births in the United States meeting criteria for a diagnosis of FAS range from .5 to 2 infants per 1,000, with the prevalence of the entire continuum of FASDs estimated to be 1 in 100. This paper discusses some of the complexities involved in diagnosing individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, provides a review of the neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits commonly seen in this population, and examines how such deficits may manifest during different developmental periods across the life span. Additionally, strategies for assessing these deficits are described, and specific measures that are appropriate for alcohol-exposed individuals are presented. The challenges of working with this under-identified and underserved population are highlighted, as well as the importance of early diagnosis and intervention.

T1  - Decision making, executive functioning, and risky behaviors in adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Rasmussen C.
A1  - Wyper K.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in life-long primary and secondary disabilities in affected individuals. Adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and/or prenatal alcohol exposure display high rates of many risky behaviors. In this paper, we review the risky behaviors common in adolescents with FASD, including trouble with the law, delinquency, substance abuse, disrupted school experience and dropping out of school, inappropriate sexual behavior, suicidality, psychopathology, and maladaptive behavior. Next, we review factors that are related to high risk behaviors in individuals with FASD, which include executive functioning deficits, impaired decision making, and abnormalities of the prefrontal cortex. Finally, we discuss why adolescence is a period of increased risk taking and poor decision making, and how individuals with FASD are particularly vulnerable during adolescence.

N2  - Objective: To discuss relevant issues in the diagnosis of mental disorders comorbid with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: We present a theoretical model of the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurobehavioral development and a systematic review of published data on the mental disorders in subjects with an FASD. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with high rates of mental disorders. We found 48 papers reporting on 3,343 subjects. The most common mental disorder comorbid with FASD is attention deficit - hyperactivity disorder occurring in 48% of subjects with FASD. Cognitive impairment is also very common. Discussion: Prenatal alcohol exposure appears to have differential effects on outcomes leading to large increases in rates of some but apparently not most mental disorders. We discuss strategies to improve the diagnosis of mental disorders in FASD and the multiplicity of uses for this important data. Copyright © Freund Publishing House Limited.

N2  - Aims: The prenatal ethanol exposure induced neuroapoptosis and neuron loss in visual cortex would be investigated in mice at P0, P7 and P14. Methods: Intubating pregnant mice ethanol daily began on E5 and continued through the pup's birth. The neuroapoptosis in visual cortex was visualized by the caspase 3 immunocytochemistry, and the neuron loss was observed with Nissl method as well. Results: With prenatal ethanol exposure, the dose-dependent neuroapoptosis and neuron loss in visual cortex could be found at P0 and even at P7 and P14 as well. Conclusions: The prenatal ethanol exposure induced neuroapoptosis and neuron loss will persist into postnatal stage, and the long-term effect of neuroapoptosis might be one of the causes of postnatal neurobehavioural disturbances associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. © The Author 2007.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is defined as a permanent birth defect syndrome caused by maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. It is characterized by growth deficiency, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and minor facial anomalies. The incidence in the USA has been estimated to be between 0.33 and 2.2 per 1000 live births. Until the 90's, there were no objective, standardized criteria for the diagnosis of FAS. We report the case of a boy aged 5 years and 10 months who has been diagnosed as having this syndrome. The aim of this article is to review and update the criteria for the diagnosis of FAS.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause damage to the developing fetus with outcomes including growth deficiency, facial dysmorphology, brain damage, and cognitive and behavioral deficits. Smaller brains in children with FASD have been linked both with reduced cell proliferation in the developing CNS and with apoptotic cell loss of postmitotic neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure in rodents during the period of brain development comparable to that of the first and second trimesters of human pregnancy persistently alters adult neurogenesis. Long-term effects of alcohol exposure during the third trimester equivalent, which occurs postnatally in the rat, on adult neurogenesis have not been previously reported. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of postnatal binge-like alcohol exposure on cell proliferation and neurogenesis in hippocampal dentate gyrus during adolescence and young adulthood. Methods: Male Long-Evans rat pups were assigned to 3 groups: alcohol-exposed (AE), sham-intubated (SI) or suckle control (SC). AE pups received ethanol in a milk formula in a binge manner (2 feedings, 2 hours apart, total dose 5.25 g/kg/day) on postnatal days (PD) 4-9. BrdU was injected every other day on PD30-50. Animals were perfused either on PD50 to examine cytogenesis and neurogenesis in hippocampal dentate gyrus at the end of BrdU injections or on PD80 to evaluate new cell survival. Dorsal hippocampal sections were immunostained for BrdU, a marker for proliferating cells, Ki67, endogenous marker of proliferation, and NeuN, a marker for mature neurons. Results: Binge-like alcohol exposure on PD4-9 significantly reduced the number of mature neurons in adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) both on PD50 and PD80, without altering cumulative cytogenesis on PD50. In addition, the number of new neurons, that were generated between PD30 and 50, was further reduced after 30 days of survival in all 3 groups (SC, SI, and AE). Conclusions: These observations suggest that early postnatal binge alcohol exposure results in long-term deficits of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, providing a potential basis for the deficits of hippocampus-dependent behaviors reported for this model. © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Context: Existing research on the neurobehavioral consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has not adequately accounted for genetic and environmental confounds. Objective: To examine the association between PAE and offspring externalizing problems in a large representative sample of families in the United States using measured covariates and a quasi-experimental design to account for unmeasured genetic and environmental confounds. Design: This study combines information from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The analyses statistically controlled for measured characteristics of the mothers and families and exposure to other prenatal psychoactive substances. In the primary analyses, siblings differentially exposed to prenatal alcohol were compared. Setting and Participants: Women were recruited from the community using a stratified and clustered probability sample and were followed longitudinally. The sample included 8621 offspring of 4912 mothers. Main Outcome Measures: Maternal report of conduct problems (CPs) and attention/impulsivity problems (AIPs) during childhood (ages 4-11 years) using standardized assessments related to psychiatric diagnoses. Results: There was an association between PAE and offspring CPs that was independent of confounded genetic and fixed environmental effects and the measured covariates. The CPs in children of mothers who drank daily during pregnancy were 0.35 SD greater than those in children whose mothers never drank during pregnancy. Although AIPs were associated with PAE when comparing unrelated offspring, children whose mothers drank more frequently during pregnancy did not have more AIPs than siblings who were less exposed to alcohol in utero. Additional subsample analyses suggested that maternal polysubstance use during pregnancy may account for the associations between PAE and AIPs. Conclusion: These results are consistent with PAE exerting an environmentally mediated causal effect on childhood CPs, but the relation between PAE and AIPs is more likely to be caused by other factors correlated with maternal drinking during pregnancy. ©2007 American Medical Association.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - The effect of 'binge' alcohol upon sphingolipid metabolism in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was examined in pregnant mice (C57BL/6J) by administering a single dose of alcohol during the third trimester (gestational day 15-16). The control mice were administered a sucrose solution of equal caloric value. Brains from progeny at postnatal days 5, 15, 21 and 30 were dissected into three regions, and sphingolipid concentrations of the brain regions were determined including assay of monoglycosylceramide, ceramide, sphingosine and sphingomyelin. We found that a single dose of ethanol induces an elevation of sphingosine (2-3.5-fold) in the brain of progeny. The level of brain ceramide at a dose of 1.5 g/kg was significantly higher than control. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy induces neuronal loss in progeny brains. Our result suggests that the elevation of sphingosine in progeny brain induced by maternal alcohol consumption may be responsible for observed neuronal loss in FAS. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Alcohol is the most common teratogen in humans. Excessive alcohol consumption in pregnant women may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, facial dysmorphology, and abnormalities in the central nervous system. Despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanisms underlying FAS remain unclear. To this end, we established a Xenopus laevis embryo model to study the effects of alcohol on fetal development. We will discuss the relationship between alcohol-induced oxidative and nitrosative stresses and their differential and critical roles in the downregulation of key developmental genes and birth defects in the X. laevis embryo model.

N2  - Aim: A recently published study reported markedly increased risk of cryptorchidism among boys whose mothers had an average gestational alcohol intake of five or more drinks per week. The aim of this study is to follow up on this finding by estimating the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and persistent cryptorchidism. Methods: We used prospectively collected information on prenatal exposures and obstetric information on the birth of 5716 boys, collected from 1984 to 1987. During the 16-19 years of follow-up in a nationwide patient register, 270 cases of cryptorchidism were diagnosed and 185 of these boys underwent orchiopexy. Results: No positive association between the mothers' average weekly alcohol consumption and persistent cryptorchidism was observed. Binge drinking was nonsignificantly associated with an excess risk of orchiopexy (adjusted RR = 1.4; 95% CI 0.9-2.1), but not with having a diagnosis of cryptorchidism without orchiopexy. Conclusions: Mothers' average weekly alcohol intake was not associated with persistent cryptorchidism, but binge drinking may be a risk factor. © 2007 The Author(s).

T1  - Effect of gestational ethanol exposure on long-term memory formation in newborn chicks
A1  - Rao V.
A1  - Chaudhuri J.D.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized by craniofacial malformations, and physical and mental retardation. It is significant that even children with history of gestational ethanol exposure but relatively unaffected overall IQ performance, often exhibit learning difficulties and behavioral problems, suggestive of impaired memory formation. Hence, the specific aim of this study was to examine memory formation in chicks exposed to ethanol during early gestation toward the understanding of neurobehavioral disturbances in FAS. Chicks were exposed to alcohol on gestational days 1-3 by injection of ethanol into the airspace of freshly fertilized eggs. The effects of prenatal ethanol on physical growth and development, and memory formation were studied. The one-trial passive avoidance learning paradigm in 1-day-old chicks was used to study memory formation in these chicks. It was observed that chick embryos exposed to 10% ethanol on gestational days 1-3 had significant reduction in all body parameters when compared with appropriate controls. Further, ethanol-exposed chick embryos had significantly impaired (P < .05) long-term memory (LTM) formation after training, though short-term or intermediate-term memory formation was unimpaired. Thus, the findings of the current study demonstrate the detrimental effects of ethanol exposure during early pregnancy on developing chick embryos in general and on memory formation in particular. Hence, it is suggested that impairment in LTM could be a fundamental mechanism for learning disorders and neurobehavioral abnormalities observed in FAS. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Unintentional injuries are a leading cause of death and disability for children. Those with developmental disabilities, including children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, are at highest risk for injuries. Although teaching safety skills is recommended to prevent injury, cognitive limitations and behavioral problems characteristic of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder make teaching these skills challenging for parents and teachers. In the current study, 32 children, ages 4-10, diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS, learned fire and street safety through computer games that employed "virtual worlds" to teach recommended safety skills. Children were pretested on verbal knowledge of four safety elements for both fire and street safety conditions and then randomly assigned to one condition. After playing the game until mastery, children were retested verbally and asked to "generalize" their newly acquired skills in a behavioral context. They were retested after 1 week follow-up. Children showed significantly better knowledge of the game to which they were exposed, immediately and at follow-up, and the majority (72%) was able to generalize all four steps within a behavioral setting. Results suggested that this is a highly effective method for teaching safety skills to high-risk children who have learning difficulties. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - The cerebellum in cognitive processes: Supporting studies in children
A1  - Steinlin M.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Over the last decade, increasing evidence of cognitive functions of the cerebellum during development and learning processes could be ascertained. Posterior fossa malformations such as cerebellar hypoplasia or Joubert syndrome are known to be related to developmental problems in a marked to moderate extent. More detailed analyses reveal special deficits in attention, processing speed, visuospatial functions and language. A study about Dandy Walker syndrome states a relationship of abnormalities in vermis lobulation with developmental problems. Further lobulation or volume abnormalities of the cerebellum and/or vermis can be detected in disorders as fragile X syndrome, Downs's syndrome or William's syndrome. Neuropsychological studies reveal a relation of dyslexia and attention deficit disorder with cerebellar functions. These functional studies are supported by structural abnormalities in neuroimaging in these disorders. Acquired cerebellar or vermis atrophy was found in groups of children with developmental problems such as prenatal alcohol exposure or extreme prematurity. Also focal lesions during childhood or adolescence such as cerebellar tumour or stroke are related with neuropsychological abnormalities, which are most pronounced in visuo-spatial, language and memory functions. In addition, cerebellar atrophy was shown to be a bad prognostic factor considering cognitive outcome in children after brain trauma and leukaemia. In ataxia teleangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily the cerebellar cortex, a reduced verbal IQ and problems of judgment of duration are a hint of the importance of the cerebellum in cognition. In conclusion, the cerebellum seems to play an important role in many higher cognitive functions especially in learning. There is a suggestion that the earlier the incorrect influence the more pronounced the problems. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - OBJECTIVES. Our goals were to determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with an increased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in infancy and to compare effects of fetal alcohol exposure and iron-deficiency anemia on infant growth. We also tested whether effects of fetal alcohol exposure on growth are mediated or moderated by iron-deficiency anemia. METHODS. A total of 96 infants born to mothers from the Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, were recruited prenatally; 42 mothers drank heavily during pregnancy, and 54 abstained or drank small amounts of alcohol. Growth was assessed at birth and 6.5 and 12 months, and iron-deficiency anemia was assessed at 6.5 or 12 months. RESULTS. Infants whose mothers binge drank during pregnancy (>4 drinks per occasion) were 3.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia at 12 months than were infants whose mothers did not binge drink. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with reduced weight at birth, 6.5 months, and 12 months and with shorter length at 6.5 and 12 months. Iron-deficiency anemia was related to reduced 12-month weight and head circumference and to slower growth velocity between 6 and 12 months. The effects of prenatal alcohol on weight were not mediated by iron-deficiency anemia; however, they were seen primarily in infants with iron-deficiency anemia. CONCLUSIONS. The association of maternal binge drinking with an increased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia may reflect disruption of accumulation of fetal iron stores or postnatal deficiencies in iron uptake, absorption, or intake. Moreover, iron deficiency seems to exacerbate the prenatal alcohol effects on growth. Copyright © 2007 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - Three independent complex segregation analyses found that the cause of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was the presence of major genes interacting with environmental influences. In order to identify potential environmental risk factors for ADHD in the Paisa community-a very well described, genetically isolated group-we randomly selected a sample of 486 children between 6 and 11 years of age. This group included 200 children with ADHD (149 males and 51 females) and 286 healthy controls (135 males and 151 females). The ADHD DSM-IV diagnosis was obtained using the DICA and BASC evaluation instruments, and the children's mothers or grandmothers filled out a questionnaire on each child's exposure to prenatal, neonatal, and early childhood risk factors. The data were analyzed using cross tabulation and stepwise logistic multiple-regression analyses. Cross tabulation associated ADHD with a variety of factors, including miscarriage symptoms, premature delivery symptoms, maternal respiratory viral infection, moderate to severe physical illness in the mother during gestation, prenatal cigarette and alcohol exposure, neonatal seizures, asphyxia or anoxia, severe neonatal illness, mild speech retardation, moderate brain injury, and febrile seizures (odds ratio > 2, P < 0.05). Stepwise logistic multiple-regression analysis also uncovered a block of variables, including male gender, maternal illnesses, prenatal alcohol exposure, mild speech retardation, febrile seizures, and moderate brain injury (odds ratio > 2.0, P < 0.05). Future studies on the risk of developing ADHD must include these environmental factors as covariates. © 2007 Steinkopff Verlag.

N2  - Cerebral hypoxia has been proposed as a mechanism by which prenatal ethanol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in children, but no study had tested this hypothesis using a chronic exposure model that mimicks a common human exposure pattern. Pregnant sheep were exposed to ethanol, 0.75 or 1.75 g kg-1 (to create blood ethanol concentrations of 85 and 185 mg dl-1, respectively), or saline 3 days per week in succession (a 'binge drinking' model) from gestational day (GD) 109 until GD 132. Fetuses were instrumented on GD 119-120 and studied on GD 132. The 1.75 g kg-1 dose resulted in a significant increase in fetal biventricular output (measured by radiolabelled microsphere technique) and heart rate, and a reduction of mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance at 1 h, the end of ethanol infusion. The arterial partial pressure of CO2 was increased, arterial pH was decreased and arterial partial pressure of O2 did not change. Fetal whole-brain blood flow increased by 37% compared with the control group at 1 h, resulting in increased cerebral oxygen delivery. The elevation in brain blood flow was region specific, occurring preferentially in the ethanol-sensitive cerebellum, increasing by 44% compared with the control group at 1 h. There were no changes in the lower dose group. Assessment of regional differences in the teratogenic effects of ethanol by stereological cell-counting technique showed a reduced number of cerebellar Purkinje cells in response to the 1.75 g kg-1 dose compared with the control brains. However, no such differences in neuronal numbers were observed in the hippocampus or the olfactory bulb. We conclude that repeated exposure to moderate doses of ethanol during the third trimester alters fetal cerebral vascular function and increases blood flow in brain regions that are vulnerable to ethanol in the presence of acidaemia and hypercapnia, and in the absence of hypoxia. © 2007 The Authors.

N2  - Objective. Review of the prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHD) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Design. We conducted a search of the Medline and Pubmed databases to identify papers reporting the association. We then searched the reference lists of the papers and reference books for additional sources. Results. We found 29 studies that met our inclusion criteria. In the 12 case series studies of subjects with FASD, the proportion of cases with a CHD (atrial [ASD] and ventricular [VSD] septal defects, other defects, or unspecified CHD) ranged from 33% to 100%. From the 14 retrospective studies, the rate of septal defects was 21%, other structural defects 6% and unspecified defects was 12%. For the 2 case-control studies, the odds of CHD ranged from 1.0 (subjects with fetal alcohol effect) to 18.0 (subjects with fetal alcohol syndrome). In the 1 prospective study of CHD the OR for a child to have CHD and FASD was 1.0. Key Conclusion. Pediatric cardiologists may have frequent contact with children with FASD and increased levels of attention to prenatal alcohol exposure as a potential etiology of CHD is indicated. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing, Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to widespread cognitive impairment and behavioral dysregulation, including deficits in attention and response inhibition. This study characterized the neural substrates underlying the disinhibited behavioral profile of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Children and adolescents (ages 8-18) with (n=13) and without (n=9) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a response inhibition (go/no-go) task. Results: Despite similar task performance (mean response latency, performance accuracy, and signal detection), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response patterns differed by group. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that during portions of the behavioral task that required response inhibition, alcohol-exposed participants showed greater BOLD response across prefrontal cortical regions (including the left medial and right middle frontal gyri), while they showed less right caudate nucleus activation, compared with control participants. Conclusions: These data provide an account of response inhibition-related brain functioning in youth with FASD. Furthermore, results suggest that the frontal-striatal circuitry thought to mediate inhibitory control is sensitive to alcohol teratogenesis. Copyright © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been recognized as a disabling condition with a significant impact on the neurobehavioral functioning of affected individuals, including cognition, behavior, and academic functioning, but little research has been performed on targeted interventions for these children. Methods: A socio-cognitive habilitative program focused on improving behavior and math functioning in children 3 to 10 years of age (n=61) was developed and evaluated. The intervention provided parental instruction on FAS, advocacy, and behavioral regulation via workshops and interactive math tutoring with children. All families received parental instruction and were then randomly assigned to either the math instruction or standard psychoeducational care groups. Results: Satisfaction with workshops was very high, with over 90% agreeing that trainers were knowledgeable and materials easy to understand and helpful. Significant gains in knowledge were found for information provided in the instructional groups. At posttesting, caregivers reported fewer problem behaviors on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, Internalizing Problem Behavior, Externalizing Problem Behavior, and Total Problem Behavior summary scales. After 5 months, both groups of children demonstrated gains in math knowledge but significantly higher gains were found in the group receiving direct math instruction. The math treatment group was also more likely to demonstrate a gain of over 1 standard deviation on any of the 4 math outcome measures used. Conclusions: These findings suggest that parents of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FAS(D)) benefit from instruction in understanding their child's alcohol-related neurological damage and strategies to provide positive behavioral supports and that targeted psychoeducational programs may be able to remediate some of the math deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a severe outcome of alcohol use during pregnancy, and the rates may be higher in countries with greater use of alcohol. To obtain information from Russian physicians (N = 23), women (N = 23), and male partners (N = 5), focus groups were conducted with 51 participants in St. Petersburg, Russia. The main objective was to determine the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior related to drinking during pregnancy. Data were analyzed using ATLAS-ti 5.0. The results will be used to develop a survey of Russian professionals and women leading to FAS prevention programming. The study's limitations are described. Copyright © 2007 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - The subject of this literature review is the fetal alcohol syndrome (F.A.S.). It will describe the effects that the ingestion of large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy, have upon the developing fetus from a physiological perspective. Alcohol is a potent teratogen in humans, and prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The physiological problems encountered by the neonate, who has been exposed to high levels of in utero alcohol, necessitating admission to the neonatal unit, will be addressed. As the neonatal unit delivers a holistic approach to care this review will also describe the psychological and sociological effects of F.A.S. on the newborn infants and their families. It will also aim to discuss how these factors influence the planning and management of care delivered to the neonate who has F.A.S., whilst being nursed on the neonatal unit. ©Pharmakon-Press.

N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can produce an array of birth defects comprising fetal alcohol syndrome. A hallmark of fetal alcohol syndrome is intrauterine growth retardation, which is associated with elevated apoptosis of placental cytotrophoblast cells. Using a human first trimester cytotrophoblast cell line, we examined the relationship between exposure to ethanol and cytotrophoblast survival, as well as the ameliorating effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors produced by human cytotrophoblast cells. After exposure to 0-100 mM ethanol, cell death was quantified by the TUNEL method, and expression of the nuclear proliferation marker, Ki67, was measured by immunohistochemistry. The mode of cell death was determined by assessing annexin V binding, caspase 3 activation, pyknotic nuclear morphology, reduction of TUNEL by caspase inhibition, and cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase. Ethanol significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death approximately 2.5-fold through the apoptotic pathway within 1-2 h of exposure to 50 mM alcohol. Exposure to 25-50 mM ethanol significantly increased transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF), but not EGF or amphiregulin (AREG). When cytotrophoblasts were exposed concurrently to 100 mM ethanol and 1 nM HBEGF or TGFA, the increase in apoptosis was prevented, while EGF ameliorated at 10 nM and AREG was weakly effective. HBEGF survival-promoting activity required ligation of either of its cognate receptors, HER1 or HER4. These findings reveal the potential for ethanol to rapidly induce cytotrophoblast apoptosis. However, survival factor induction could provide cytotrophoblasts with an endogenous cytoprotective mechanism. © 2007 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure may adversely affect fetal development, causing growth restriction, distinctive craniofacial anomalies, and central nervous system dysfunction. The continuum of associated adverse fetal outcomes is most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The purpose of this study was to further clarify the relationship between dysmorphic features and general cognitive capacity in a study on Finnish children with FASD. Forty-eight 8- to 16-year-old children with FASD underwent a dysmorphology examination and an assessment of cognitive capacity. Dysmorphic features and growth deficiency were quantified by assigning each child a total dysmorphology score (TDS). Six subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) were used for assessment of general cognitive capacity. Our results show a significant correlation between the TDS and cognitive capacity was found, suggesting that children with more severe growth deficiency and dysmorphic features have more cognitive limitations. Birth measures of length and weight correlated with general cognitive capacity. Head circumference correlated only with Performance IQ. These findings imply an inverse relationship between growth deficiency/dysmorphic features and cognitive function in children with FASD. Although the correlations are significant, the data suggest that in individual cases, the TDS cannot reliably predict cognitive function in later life. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This investigation examined the influence of parental substance use disorder (SUD) and mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy on neurobehavior disinhibition (ND) measured in 10- to 12-year-old children. The extent to which ND predicted SUD outcome 7 to 9 years later was also determined. METHODS: SUD was documented in each parent and as the outcome variable in their 19-year-old sons. Average daily alcohol consumption during the mother's pregnancy was recorded using a structured interview. ND was assessed using indicators of behavior undercontrol, affect modulation and executive cognitive functions. RESULTS: Paternal SUD and the interaction between maternal SUD and alcohol consumption during pregnancy predicted child's ND score. ND at 10 to 12 years of age was a significant predictor of SUD at age 19. CONCLUSIONS: The disinhibitory disturbance associated with risk of SUD has both transmissible and teratogenic causes. The ramifications of this finding for pediatric practice are discussed. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Background: Alcohol use during pregnancy can result in a continuum of effects including growth deficits, dysmorphology and/or complex patterns of behavioural and cognitive difficulties that influence an individual's functioning throughout their lifespan. We conducted a systematic review to identify research-based interventions for children and youth with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and areas for future study. Methods: We identified the substantive literature by searching 40 peer-reviewed and 23 grey literature databases, as well as reference lists. We hand-searched eight relevant journals, and undertook a systematic search of Internet sites and review of reports and documents received from key stakeholders. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Given the small number of studies that met all inclusion criteria, both experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included. Results: Ten intervention studies were identified, of which three were experimental or quasi-experimental, and four were non-experimental. Despite multiple attempts, three studies (two in foreign languages and one unpublished) could not be acquired. A meta-analysis could not be undertaken because the included studies examined different interventions or outcomes. Interventions targeted in the included studies were as follows: (i) psychostimulant medications (methyphenidate, pemoline and dextroamphetamine); and (ii) Cognitive Control Therapy. The identified studies were limited by very small sample sizes and weak designs. Conclusion: There is limited scientific evidence upon which to draw recommendations regarding efficacious interventions for children and youth with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Clinicians, researchers, service providers, educators, policy makers, affected children and youth and their families, and others need to urgently collaborate to develop a comprehensive research agenda for this population. © 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - * It is well accepted that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, but research findings for exposure to low to moderate alcohol levels during pregnancy are equivocal, allowing a range of interpretations. * The 2001 guideline from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for low-risk drinking for "women who are pregnant or might soon become pregnant" recommends fewer than seven standard drinks per week, and no more than two standard drinks on any one day. This position has polarised health professional and consumer opinion in Australia. * The NHMRC guidelines on alcohol are scheduled for review in 2007. We surveyed the alcohol and pregnancy policies and clinical practice guidelines of Australia and six other English-speaking countries to identify current policy. Documents were obtained through Internet searches and direct contact with the relevant organisations. * The policies and guidelines varied both across and within countries, and the NHMRC guideline, while not universally supported in Australia, is in step with the policies of the United Kingdom and Canada. * Research is needed to elucidate the true association between low to moderate alcohol consumption and fetal harm, the impact of different policies on rates of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and any untoward outcomes of an abstinence message, to inform and underpin future policy development in Australia.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Alcohol abuse produces damaging effects on the CNS that leads to several types of disorders. When consumed during pregnancy, alcohol may cause craniofacial malformations, growth retardation and brain damage in offspring. These symptoms are grouped by the term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is the most common cause of non-genetic mental retardation in the western world. Substantial efforts to elucidate the molecular basis of these impairments are currently in progress. Whereas FAS is totally preventable by avoiding alcohol intake during pregnancy, efficient therapies to prevent or mitigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are still not available but many pharmacological treatments have been developed to avoid alcohol intake and dependence in adults. The present article reviews the most relevant mechanisms of alcohol injury in developing brain and the strategies and patents that are currently available and in progress to prevent therapy for FAS. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Background: Glucosamine (GLS) is an endogenous aminomonosaccharide. It is used as a disease-modifying agent for the treatment of osteoarthritis. There is no information regarding its use in pregnancy. Our objective was to determine whether GLS treatment in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major malformations or other adverse outcomes. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited from The Motherisk Program at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Women exposed to GLS were compared with women exposed to nonteratogenic agents. They were matched for gestational age at time of call, maternal age, and cigarette and alcohol consumption. Rates of major malformations and other end points of interest were compared between the two groups. Results: We were able to ascertain the outcomes of 54 women who used GLS during pregnancy (34 during organogenesis). There were 50 live births (two sets of twins), 4 spontaneous abortions, 1 therapeutic abortion, and 1 stillbirth, with no major malformations. The mean birth weight was 3524 +/- 482 g, and the median gestational age at birth was 39 weeks (range 37-40). Conclusions: These limited data suggest no increased risk for major malformations or other adverse fetal effects following the use of GLS during pregnancy. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background: After maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, many neonates affected by less apparent forms of fetal alcohol syndrome disorder (FASD) do not receive proper diagnosis or treatment. There is thus a need for laboratory markers for early detection of alcohol-exposed neonates. The aim of our study was to assess the efficiency of the usual alcohol biomarkers measured in cord blood to identify alcohol-exposed neonates immediately after birth. Methods: A 1-year study was conducted in the labor wards of the maternity units of the Auvergne, Central France at the time of term delivery. The patients answered an anonymous self-completion survey concerning alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test; AUDIT) during their pregnancy. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and -glutamyltransferase concentrations and the percentage of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were measured in maternal and cord blood. Results: We collected 870 maternal-fetal sample pairs. Two cases (0.2%) of typical FASD were detected. We report a non-significant correlation between maternal and cord blood biomarkers. None of the cord blood biomarkers differed significantly between newborns of alcohol-exposed and unexposed mothers. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the usual alcohol biomarkers are not effective in cord blood for identifying alcohol-exposed neonates. ©2007 by Walter de Gruyter.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Abuse of alcohol during pregnancy is known to cause alcoholic embryopathy and congenital cardiac disease. We sought to establish if there were any cardiac abnormalities to be found in patients known to have alcoholic embryopathy, but with structurally normal hearts. We reviewed the electrocardiograms and echocardiographic data of 347 such patients without congenital cardiac disease. A shortened QT interval was found in half of the cases. The left ventricular diameter was small in one quarter of all patients, independent from age, gender, and the degree of alcoholic embryopathy. We conclude that intrauterine exposure to alcohol as a primary toxin can lead to minor cardiac abnormalities, even in the absence of structural congenital cardiac disease. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

N2  - We examined functional MRI activation patterns corresponding to verbal paired associate learning in a group of 11 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure compared with 16 typically developing children. Among the typically developing children, prominent activation was observed in the left medial temporal lobe, left dorsal frontal lobe and bilateral posterior temporal cortices during learning and recall. Analyses revealed significantly less activation in left medial and posterior temporal regions and significantly more activation in right dorsal frontal cortex in the alcohol-exposed children relative to controls, even when group differences in memory test performance were statistically controlled. These results may indicate an increased reliance on frontal memory systems in the children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, perhaps compensating for dysfunctional medial temporal memory systems. Our findings are consistent with neuropsychological and structural imaging studies, and provide the first evidence for brain activation abnormalities, independent of group performance differences, during verbal learning and recall in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the brain are seen at every age. The earlier they can be quantified, the better the prognosis for the affected child. Here we show measurable alcohol effects at birth on a structure currently used for nosology only much later in life. Methods: Midline shape of the corpus callosum was imaged in infants via averaged unwarped transfontanelle ultrasound. We compared measures of these shapes among 23 infants prenatally exposed to high levels of alcohol and 21 infants unexposed to alcohol or only lightly exposed. Results: A particular feature of the corpus callosum, the appearance of a "hook" (obtuse angle) between the splenium and the long diameter of the arch in this plane, is strongly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. In half of the high-exposed infants, the splenium angle is larger than in any of the unexposed brains. Simply characterizing this angle as less than or greater than 90degree detects 12 of the 23 exposed infants as anomalous with only 1 false positive among the unexposed. This apparently direct effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on the details of the callosum in about half the at-risk subjects cannot be attributed to any of several plausible competing exposures or other confounding factors applying during or after gestation. Conclusion: An average of the images for the unexposed subjects has the geometry of textbook images of normal babies; but the average for the subgroup of high-angle subjects may serve as a template or guide to this regional damage parallel to the familiar photographic exemplars that help to assess facial signs.

N2  - Objectives: The prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) were determined in a third primary school cohort in a community in South Africa (SA). Methods: An active case ascertainment, two-tier screening methodology, and the revised Institute of Medicine diagnostic criteria were employed among 818 first grade pupils. Characteristics of children with FAS and PFAS are contrasted with a randomly selected control group. Data were collected and analyzed for children in the study regarding: (1) physical growth and development, including dysmorphology, (2) intelligence and behavioral characteristics, and (3) their mother's social, behavioral, and physical characteristics. Results: The rate of FAS and PFAS in this area continues as the highest reported in any overall community and is much higher than rates elsewhere. In this cohort it is 68.0-89.2 per 1000. Severe episodic drinking on weekends among mothers of children with FAS and PFAS accounts for 96% of all alcohol consumed. Various measures of maternal drinking are significantly correlated with negative outcomes of children in the areas of non-verbal intelligence (-0.26), verbal intelligence (-0.28), problem behavior (0.31), and overall dysmorphology score (0.59). Significantly more FAS and PFAS exists among children of rural residents (OR = 3.79). Conclusions: A high rate of FAS and PFAS was again documented in this community, and it has increased. Given population similarities, we suspect that other communities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa also have high rates. Programs for prevention are needed. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. This study compared the prevalence of psychopathological conditions in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (N = 39) and nonexposed, typically developing peers (N = 30), matched with respect to age, gender, and socioeconomic status. METHODS. Caregivers were interviewed with either the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime Version, or the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version IV. Statistical resampling methods were used to create 95% confidence intervals for the difference between the proportions of children with psychopathological conditions in the exposed and control groups. RESULTS. Group differences were seen in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depressive disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and specific phobia outcome categories. The group difference in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder category was by far the largest effect observed. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that fetal alcohol exposure should be considered a possible factor in the pathogenesis of childhood psychiatric disorders. These data provide clinically relevant information about the mental health problems that children with fetal alcohol exposure are likely to face.

N2  - OBJECTIVES. High levels of alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to adverse physical and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. It remains uncertain whether there is a safe level of drinking during pregnancy. In this study we investigate whether very low levels of alcohol consumption (<1 drink per week) are independently associated with childhood mental health problems (assessed at 3 time points between ages 4 and 8 years) and whether these effects are moderated by gender. We expected that only higher levels of alcohol consumption would be associated with later mental health problems and that any associations might be more readily detectable in boys. METHODS. This prospective, population-based study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We investigated the relationship between self-reports of the amount and frequency of alcohol use in the first trimester and the presence of clinically significant mental health (behavioral and emotional) problems at 47 and 81 months (parental report: n = 9086 and 8046, respectively) and at 93 to 108 months (teacher report: n = 5648). RESULTS. After controlling for a range of prenatal and postnatal factors, the consumption of <1 drink per week during the first trimester was independently associated with clinically significant mental health problems in girls at 47 months. This gender-specific association persisted at 81 months and was confirmed by later teacher ratings. CONCLUSIONS. Very low levels of alcohol consumption during early pregnancy may have a negative and persistent effect on mental health outcomes. Given the lack of a clear dose-response relationship and unexpected gender effects, these findings should be considered preliminary and need additional investigation.

N2  - Objective: To establish the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in Victoria through the Victorian Birth Defects Register (VBDR). Methods: A sample of live births from 1995-2002 was selected from the Victorian Perinatal Data Collection and VBDR based on reported microcephaly, FAS or maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy. Following ethics approval, medical records of mother and child were requested for 117 births. One hundred and nine of these were accessed and examined for factors related to FAS. Records were categorised as FAS, possible FAS, unable to categorise, or not FAS. Results: From the VBDR the prevalence was calculated at 0.006 per 1,000 live births. Four additional possible cases of FAS increased this to 0.014 per 1,000 live births. Six cases were defined as 'unable to categorise'as alcohol use was unknown but other features of FAS were evident. Including these cases, plus five where some low-level alcohol use was reported, increased the prevalence to 0.03 per 1,000 live births. Twenty-eight per cent of the audit population and 39% of the microcephalic cases had no information about maternal alcohol use recorded in the antenatal or babies'records. Conclusion and Implications: The audit of medical records provided additional information regarding FAS prevalence in Victoria. This prevalence ranges from 0.01 to 0.03 per 1,000 live births. To accurately assess the extent of the problem, there needs to be improved reporting of alcohol use in pregnancy and a system in place to report cases diagnosed during and beyond the perinatal period to the VBDR.

T1  - Increased 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in liver and adipose tissue of rat offspring exposed to alcohol in utero

N2  - Rat offspring prenatally exposed to alcohol display features of metabolic syndrome characterized by a low birth weight, catch-up growth, dyslipidemia, and insulin-resistant diabetes with increased gluconeogenesis, during adult life. Gluconeogenesis is partly regulated by cyclic AMP- and glucocorticoid-dependent mechanisms. Glucocorticoid action at the receptor level depends on its circulating concentrations and is amplified at the prereceptor level by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), which regenerates active glucocorticoids from inactive forms. To determine whether 11beta-HSD1 is dysregulated in this rat model, we examined the expression and enzyme activity of 11beta-HSD1 and its regulator enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) in the liver of postnatal day 7 (neonatal) and 3-mo-old (adult) rat offspring prenatally exposed to alcohol. Measurements of 11beta-HSD1 and H6PD were also performed in the omental fat of adult rat offspring. In both neonatal and adult rats, prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in increased tissue corticosterone concentrations, increased expression, and oxoreductase activity of 11beta-HSD1, and a parallel increase of H6PD expression. The data suggest that due to both transcriptional and posttranscriptional dysregulations, rats exposed to alcohol early in life have increased 11beta-HSD1 activity, which may explain insulin-resistant diabetes in these animals later in life.

N2  - Alcohol is detrimental to the developing brain and remains the leading cause of mental retardation in developed countries. The mechanism of alcohol brain damage remains elusive. Studies of neurological problems in adults have focused on alcohol's cerebrovascular effects, because alcoholism is a major risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular injuries. However, few studies have examined similar cerebrovascular effects of fetal alcohol exposure. We examined the effect of chronic binge alcohol exposure during the second trimester on fetal cerebrovascular and metabolic responses to hypoxia in near-term sheep and tested the hypothesis that fetal alcohol exposure would attenuate cerebrovascular dilation to hypoxia. Pregnant ewes were infused with alcohol (1.5 g/kg) or saline intravenously at 60-90 days of gestation (full term = 150 days). At 125 days of gestation, we measured fetal cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism at baseline and during hypoxia. Maternal blood alcohol averaged 214 +/- 5.9 mg/dl immediately after the 1.5-h infusion, with similar values throughout the month of infusion. Hypoxia resulted in a robust increase in CBF in saline-infused fetuses. However, the CBF response to hypoxia in fetuses chronically exposed to alcohol was significantly attenuated. Cerebral oxygen delivery decreased in both groups of fetuses during hypoxia but to a greater degree in the alcohol-exposed fetuses. Prenatal alcohol exposure during the second trimester attenuates cerebrovascular responses to hypoxia in the third trimester. Altered cerebrovascular reactivity might be one mechanism for alcohol-related brain damage and might set the stage for further brain injury if a hypoxic insult occurs.

T1  - Neuroprotective peptides prevent some alcohol-induced alteration in -aminobutyric acid A-beta3, which plays a role in cleft lip and palate and learning in fetal alcohol syndrome

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects 1 in 100 births in the United States and results in craniofacial dysmorphologic condition and learning disabilities. In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroprotective peptides prevented fetal death and learning deficits. The -aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor subunit GABAbeta3 plays a critical role for nervous system and palate development. Our objective was to determine whether the neuropeptides prevented alcohol-induced damage through GABAbeta3. Study design: With a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, timed pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol) or control (saline solution) or alcohol plus peptides NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (NAP + SAL; 20 mug). Embryos were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days after treatment. Adult males were tested for learning on the Morris water maze, and their brains were dissected. With samples from at least 3 litters per time point, calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for GABAbeta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher protected least significant difference. Results: Twenty-four hours and 10 days after treatment, alcohol decreased GABAbeta3 in the embryos (P < .01); this decrease was prevented by the peptides (P = .01). GABAbeta3 was higher in alcohol treated adult brains respect to the controls (P = .002); this rise was not prevented by the peptides. Conclusion: Treatment with the neuropeptides NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA prevented the alcohol-induced decline in GABAbeta3 expression 10 days after alcohol exposure. Because palate formation continues through E18, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA may be beneficial for the prevention of cleft lip and palate. © 2007 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most devastating. Recognized by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities and growth deficiency, this condition produces severe alcohol-induced damage in the developing brain. FAS children experience ataxia; deficits in intellectual functioning; and difficulties in learning, memory, problem solving, and attention. Multiple aspects of central nervous system development can be affected by alcohol exposure, but the most striking abnormalities are neuronal and glial migration. Little is known about cellular mechanisms by which alcohol affects the migration of immature neurons. Recently, it has been found that Ca2+ signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of the action of alcohol in neuronal cell migration. Most importantly, the aberrant migration of immature neurons caused by alcohol exposure is significantly ameliorated by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways. In this Mini-Review, we first describe how alcohol exposure impairs the migration of cerebellar granule cells and then discuss the signaling mechanisms involved. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can adversely affect the fetus. We investigated the association between maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and cryptorchidism (undescended testis) among newborn boys. Methods: We examined 2,496 boys in a prospective Danish-Finnish birth cohort study for cryptorchidism at birth (cryptorchid/healthy: 128/2,368) and at 3 months of age (33/2,215). Quantitative information on alcohol consumption (average weekly consumption of wine, beer, and spirits and number of binge episodes), smoking, and caffeine intake was obtained by questionnaire and/or interview once during the third trimester of pregnancy, before the outcome of the pregnancy was known. For a subgroup (n = 465), information on alcohol consumption was obtained twice during pregnancy by interviews. Results: We investigated maternal alcohol consumption both as a continuous variable and categorized. The odds for cryptorchidism increased with increasing weekly alcohol consumption. After adjustment for confounders (country, smoking, caffeine intake, binge episodes, social class, maternal age, parity, maturity, and birth weight) the odds remained significant for women with a weekly consumption of five or more alcoholic drinks (odds ratio = 3.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-9.10). Conclusions: Regular alcohol intake during pregnancy appears to increase the risk of congenital cryptorchidism in boys. The mechanisms for this association are unknown. Counseling of pregnant women with regard to alcohol consumption should also consider this new finding.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in a spectrum of adverse developmental outcomes in offspring, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Deficits in executive function - the psychological processes involved in controlling voluntary goal-oriented behavior - are prevalent in FASD. Oculomotor tasks have been designed as highly sensitive tools to evaluate components of executive function. Because of the extensive overlap in the brain areas controlling eye movements and those affected in FASD, we hypothesized that individuals with FASD display specific neurobehavioral abnormalities that can be quantified with eye movement testing. Methods: Subjects (8-12 years old) were instructed to look either toward (prosaccade) or away from (antisaccade) a stimulus that appeared in the peripheral visual field. Two fixation conditions were used. In the gap condition, the central fixation point (FP) was removed before the appearance of the peripheral stimulus; in the overlap condition, the FP remained illuminated. Saccadic reaction times (SRTs, time from stimulus appearance to saccade initiation), direction errors (saccades made in the incorrect direction relative to instruction), and express saccades (short-latency: SRT=90-140 ms) were measured to assess automatic and volitional saccade control. Results: Compared with controls, FASD children had elongated reaction times, excessive direction errors, and no express saccades. Metric analysis of correct prosaccades revealed a trend toward increased saccadic duration and decreased saccadic velocity in FASD subjects. Conclusion: These results reflect deficits in executive function and motor control, and are consistent with dysfunction of the frontal lobes, possibly due to disrupted inhibitory mechanisms. Therefore, eye movement tasks may be powerful and easy tools for assessing executive function deficits in FASD. Copyright © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: A range of adverse birth outcomes is associated with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Aim: To examine the effects of moderate levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy on children's intellectual ability, learning and attention at 14 years of age. Study design and subjects: The Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy involves a prospective birth cohort of 7223 singletons whose mothers were enrolled at the first antenatal visit. At 14 years, 5139 mothers and adolescents completed attentional and learning questionnaires, and 3731 adolescents completed psychometric assessments. Outcome measures: For adolescents, the Wide Range Achievement Test - Revised (WRAT-R) and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices Test (Raven's) were administered. Mothers completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and adolescents completed the Youth Self Report (YSR). Learning was assessed by a series of questions in the mother and adolescent questionnaires. Maternal measures included the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, and the extent of binge drinking. Results: For consumption of < 1 glass/day in early or late pregnancy, there was no association with any attention, learning or cognitive outcomes. The strongest estimates of effect were found among those consuming > 1 glasses/day. Exposure in late pregnancy was associated with increased prevalence of overall learning difficulty in the unadjusted, although not the adjusted analysis. Binge drinking was associated with a higher prevalence of Raven's score < 85 (1 standard deviation). Conclusions: Although a number of study limitations need to be considered, the results suggest that consumption at the level of < 1 drink/day does not lead to adverse outcomes in relation to attention, learning and cognitive abilities, as measured in the current research. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - In Italy, little is known about the spectrum of adverse fetal effects related to maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. In this paper, we report on the phenotype of Italian children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These data were gathered as part of a field study assessing the prevalence of FASD in children in an in-school study in a rural area near Rome. The purposes of this paper are: (1) to completely characterize the clinical phenotype of a large cohort of Italian children with FASD; (2) to correlate and contrast the phenotype of this population with that observed in other populations and reported in the medical literature; (3) to discuss the drinking habits of Italian women, before, during and after pregnancy; and (4) to suggest mechanisms for intervention and prevention of FASD based on data gathered from this study. © 2006.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure causes permanent structural alterations to the brain and can lead to numerous cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Consistent with many of the neuropsychological and behavioral deficits that have been reported, neuroimaging studies reveal a pattern of structural abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This chapter systematically reviews structural anomalies by brain region, identifying cognitive and behavioral correlates when relevant. The consensus shows that in addition to the overall reduction of brain size, prominent brain shape abnormalities have been observed, with narrowing in the parietal region and reduced brain growth in portions of the frontal lobe. Commensurating with these anomalies, volumetric and tissue density findings cite disproportionate reductions in the parietal lobe, cerebellar vermis, corpus callosum, and the caudate nucleus, suggesting that certain areas of the brain may be especially vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure. In sum, neuroimaging techniques have greatly advanced our understanding of brain-behavior relationships in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and hopefully will lead to improved diagnosis and treatment options for those affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the most severe manifestation of the adverse effects of alcohol on foetal development, was first described in the French medical literature by Lemoine et al. in 1968 [Les Gfants des parents alcholiques: anomalies observes a propos de 127 cas (The children of alchoholic parents: anomalies observed in 127 cases). Quert in Medicine 8, 476-482]. Five years later, Jones et al., 1973. Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic alcholic mothers. Lancet 1, 1129-1267] were the first to delineate systematically the association between maternal alcohol abuse and a specific pattern of birth defects and to provide diagnostic criteria for this condition. Several diagnostic systems have since been developed with a view to capturing the wide spectrum of physical and behavioral anomalies resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. The purpose of the current paper is to outline the evolution of FAS as a medical diagnosis. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Defining the behavioral phenotype in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A review
A1  - Kodituwakku P.W.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - While there exists a large body of literature on cognitive functions in children with prenatal alcohol exposure, it remains undetermined if these children exhibit a unique profile of cognitive-behavioral functioning or a behavioral phenotype. Researchers have consistently found that intellectual functioning, as assessed by IQ tests, of children with prenatal alcohol exposure is deficient. There is increasing evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with slow information processing and attentional problems, in particular inattentiveness. Studies examining specific cognitive abilities such as language, visual perception, and memory in alcohol-affected children have shown performance decrements associated with increased task complexity. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure have also been found to exhibit significant deficits in daily functional skills or adaptive behavior, with deficits in socialization becoming pronounced during adolescence. The above findings point to the conclusion that a generalized deficit in complex information processing constitutes the central cognitive-behavioral characteristic of children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Researchers have consistently documented that specific brain regions are more affected by alcohol than other regions. The problem of mapping focal anomalies of the brain with a generalized pattern of deficits can be solved by taking developmental processes into consideration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A practical clinical approach to diagnosis
A1  - Manning M.A.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - In utero exposure to alcohol can have numerous adverse effects on a developing fetus. These effects represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities that have recently been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Children at the most severe end of this spectrum and displaying the complete phenotype of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system are defined as having fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). While FAS is the most readily clinically recognized form of FASD, other categories within the continuum of adverse effects due to prenatal alcohol exposure are becoming better defined. These include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). As more is learned regarding the exact manifestations of alcohol on brain development, these classifications may be expanded and/or refined. Because FASD represents a major public health concern, early recognition of at-risk children is important for initiating interventional strategies. Thus, the purpose of this report is to educate practicing physicians about the recognizable phenotypes of FASD in order to accurately identify these children and implement the most appropriate management plans. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. Design: A randomized controlled trial (2002-2005; data analyzed 2005-2006) of a brief motivational intervention to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) in preconceptional women by focusing on both risk drinking and ineffective contraception use. Setting/Participants: A total of 830 nonpregnant women, aged 18-44 years, and currently at risk for an AEP were recruited in six diverse settings in Florida, Texas, and Virginia. Combined settings had higher proportions of women at risk for AEP (12.5% overall) than in the general population (2%). Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive information plus a brief motivational intervention (n=416) or to receive information only (n=414). The brief motivational intervention consisted of four counseling sessions and one contraception consultation and services visit. Main Outcome Measures: Women consuming more than five drinks on any day or more than eight drinks per week on average, were considered risk drinkers; women who had intercourse without effective contraception were considered at risk of pregnancy. Reversing either or both risk conditions resulted in reduced risk of an AEP. Results: Across the follow-up period, the odds ratios (ORs) of being at reduced risk for AEP were twofold greater in the intervention group: 3 months, 2.31 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.69-3.20); 6 months, 2.15 (CI=1.52-3.06); 9 months, 2.11 (CI=1.47-3.03). Between-groups differences by time phase were 18.0%, 17.0%, and 14. 8%, respectively. Conclusions: A brief motivational intervention can reduce the risk of an AEP. © 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have numerous adverse growth, structural and neurodevelopmental consequences for the developing fetus. This spectrum of disabilities has been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The most severe condition in this continuum of disability is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by a distinctive pattern of facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system that often include mental retardation. Children with FASD who manifest some, but not all, of the features of FAS can be further categorized as having partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Specific structural birth defects (e.g. malformations of the heart, kidneys and/or musculoskeletal system) are the hallmark of ARBD in a child with normal growth and development; whereas, ARND comprises a specific pattern of disordered behavior and development among alcohol exposed children with normal growth and structural development. In addiction medicine, some evidence indicates that prenatal alcohol exposure can increase the risk for behavioral disorders, including depression and negative self-esteem in the offspring of alcoholic women. Furthermore, prenatal alcohol exposure may result in long-term neurocognitive disorders involving problems with executive functioning, higher level language deficits and behavioral disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize what recently has been reported regarding specific criteria for defining and diagnosing the conditions within the overarching term FASD. Such criteria allow the continuum of FASD to be more readily diagnosed by practicing pediatricians, thereby leading to earlier intervention and amelioration of related medical and behavioral disorders.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health problem and is an established cause of serious birth defects and developmental delay collectively described as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is caused by congenital alcohol-induced damages and is a cause of mental retardation. It is characterised by facial abnormalities and growth deficiency. Infants affected by the syndrome show intellectual impairment, and difficulties in learning, memory, problem-solving, and attention as well as experiencing additional problems with mental health and social interactions. However, an absence of the characteristic facial defects and growth deficiency may result in a failure to identify children with prenatal alcohol exposure, which can further present as alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorder (ARND) or alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Estimates of prevalence of FAS in U.S.A. range between 0.3 to 2.2 per 1,000 live births, but much higher rates occurring in some communities. Harmonisation of the methodology used for epidemiological studies, with research activities that establishes real baseline prevalence of FAS and identification of women who are at highest risk of bearing a FAS-affected child, are an essential prerequisite to prevention. In addition, it is essential to assess different FAS preventive approaches through carefully controlled studies. Universal, selected, and indicated preventive strategies have been identified, targeting different kind of populations. Since FAS and other adverse effects of drinking during pregnancy are theoretically completely preventable, it is vital to make more efforts to improve the application of the most appropriate interventions. Although in Italy alcohol consumption has constantly increased, mainly amongst the young (including women of childbearing age), knowledge on FAS and alcohol-related effects is completely lacking. Because of the high cost for care of individuals with this syndrome, it is essential to apply appropriate interventions to prevent this problem.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD) is one of the most preventable sources of developmental abnormalities, and has a singular cause-alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Estimates for the costs of treatment of a single case of FASD range often above one million dollars. The primary strategy for prevention currently centers on no alcohol consumption during pregnancy. However, a sizeable number of North American women currently drink during pregnancy. A literature review examined the behavior of maternal alcohol consumption in order to understand the rationale associated with drinking. Generally, it appears that pregnant women differ by their alcohol consumption habits and their reasons to drink. In an attempt to eliminate FASD, we review a number of educational, legal, and community-based programs that have been used to promote abstinence and examine where they have been successful. Unfortunately, social marketing strategies have received less attention. Several potential applications of social marketing directed to drinkingduring- pregnancy campaigns are suggested, and possible contributions to the overall effort are explained.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) consists of multi-system abnormalities and is caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of alcohol on the human foetus has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and FAS is the most important human teratogenic condition known today. The purpose of this study was to analyse the craniofacial parameters of children with FAS and compare them with matched controls. Ninety children diagnosed with FAS (45 males, 45 females) and 90 controls were matched for age, gender, and social class. The mean age of the FAS children was 8.9 years with the controls slightly older at 9.1 years. This age difference was not significant (P = 0.34). A standard lateral cephalometric radiograph of each subject was taken. The radiographs were digitized for 20 linear and 17 angular measurements. These 37 variables were formulated to assess the size, shape, and relative position of three craniofacial complexes: (1) the cranial base, (2) midface, and (3) mandible. In addition, nine variables were computed to compare the soft tissue profiles. The study showed that measurements related to face height and mandibular size appear to be the most important features when distinguishing FAS children. Overall, the FAS children in the present study presented with vertically and horizontally underdeveloped maxillae, together with features of long face syndrome with large gonial angles and a short ramus in relation to total face height. There was also a tendency for the development of an anterior open bite, which appears to be compensated for by an increase in the vertical dimension of the anterior alveolar process to bring the incisor teeth into occlusion. The latter adaptation occurred mainly in the mandible. © The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Orthodontics Society. All rights reserved.

N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) consists of multisystem abnormalities and is caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of alcohol on the human foetus has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and FAS is one of the most important human teratogenic conditions known today. The purpose of this study was to assess the dental age (DA) and skeletal age (SA) of children with FAS and compare them with matched controls. The samples of 90 children diagnosed with FAS and 90 controls were matched for age, gender, and social class. The mean chronological age (CA) of the FAS subjects was 8.95 years, with the controls slightly older at 9.04 years. This difference was not significant. Dental maturity was determined by assessing the stage of tooth formation and SA assessment was made from hand-wrist radiographs for the patients and controls by assigning a SA and comparing it with standard plates. The means and standard deviations of CA and DA for the stages of calcification were calculated and the Pearson ranked order correlation coefficient was applied to measure the associations between skeletal maturity indicators and DA. t-tests were used to test for group differences between independent groups, and paired t-tests to determine paired group differences. This study provided evidence of a positive association between DA and SA in both the FAS children and the controls. The data suggest that both DA and SA may be a reflection of general somatic growth. It must be acknowledged that growth of individuals is often irregular, when any norms of development based on central tendencies and variabilities of healthy children are applied. Some aspects of growth and development for healthy children may show a variable pattern of growth. Therefore, correlation of these aspects of growth and development will often not show the degree of correlation that theoretically exists between different areas of growth and development. A more complete appraisal of the entire skeleton and an evaluation of the entire dentition, rather than just the mandibular teeth, might improve the correlation between the variables. © The Author 2006.

T1  - Detection of in vivo DNA damage induced by ethanol in multiple organs of pregnant mice using the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Ethanol is principal ingredient of alcohol beverage, but considered as human carcinogen, and has neurotoxicity. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy often causes fetal alcohol syndrome. The DNA damage is one of the important factors in carcinogenicity or teratogenicity. To detect the DNA damage induced by ethanol, we used an in vivo alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay in pregnant mice organs and embryos. Pregnant ICR mice on Day 7 of gestation were treated with 2, 4 or 8 g/kg ethanol, and maternal organs/tissues and embryos were subjected to the Comet assay at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr after ethanol treatment. Four and 8 g/kg ethanol induced DNA damage in brain, lung and embryos at 4 or 8 hr after the treatment. Two g/kg ethanol did not cause any DNA damage, and 8 g/kg ethanol only increased the duration of DNA damage without distinct increase in the degree of the damage. No significant DNA damage was observed in the liver. To detect the effect of acetaldehyde, disulfiram, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, was administered before 4 g/kg ethanol treatment. No significant increase of DNA damage was observed in the disulfiram pre-treated group. These data indicate that ethanol induces DNA damage, which might be related to ethanol toxicity. Since pre-treatment of disulfiram did not increase DNA damage, DNA damage observed in this study might not be the effect of acetaldehyde.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Objective and methods: To explore association between prevalence of ADHD and levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure, the authors reviewed the charts of 2,231 youth referred for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Participants were categorized into four groups by different levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure. For each group, the prevalence rates of ADHD and other selected disorders were determined. Results: The disorder ranking first in overall prevalence was ADHD (41%), followed by learning disorder (17%) and oppositional-defiant/conduct disorder (16%). Prevalence rates of ADHD across the groups generally were high risk > some risk > unknown risk > no risk. Conclusion: The frequency distribution of ADHD cases was according to the levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure. These results add to a growing body of evidence supporting an association between ADHD and prenatal alcohol exposure. Findings need to be confirmed by definitive studies on ADHD and gestational alcohol exposure. © 2006 Sage Publications.

T1  - Comparison of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and the hoyme diagnostic guidelines for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
A1  - Astley S.J.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - OBJECTIVE. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and the Hoyme fetal alcohol spectrum disorders diagnostic guidelines differ markedly. The performances of the 2 diagnostic systems were compared. METHODS. The fetal alcohol syndrome diagnostic criteria from the 4-Digit Code and Hoyme guidelines were applied to 952 patients who had received an interdisciplinary, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, diagnostic evaluation at the University of Washington with the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and 16 children with confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure. RESULTS. The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome was 3.7% with the 4-Digit Code and 4.1% with the Hoyme guidelines. Although the prevalences were similar, the patients identified were not. Only 17 individuals met the fetal alcohol syndrome criteria for both systems. An extraordinary number of patients (35%) met the Hoyme criteria for the fetal alcohol syndrome facial phenotype, but only 39 of those 330 patients met the Hoyme criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome. Even some children with no alcohol exposure (25%) had the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome face. The specificities of the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome face for the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome diagnosis and prenatal alcohol exposure were low in these populations. CONCLUSIONS. Without a specific facial phenotype, a valid diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome cannot be rendered for patients with prenatal alcohol exposure, because a causal link between their outcomes and exposure cannot be established, and a valid diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome cannot be rendered for patients with unknown alcohol exposure, because the face cannot serve as a valid proxy measure for alcohol exposure. Diagnostic guidelines must confirm the specificity of their fetal alcohol syndrome facial criteria to validate their diagnostic criteria. Copyright © 2006 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

T1  - Myelin degeneration in peripheral nerve in chick embryos following continuous ethanol exposure during early gestational period: A preliminary report
A1  - Chaudhuri J.D.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized among other features by motor and sensory derangements and neurobehavioral deficits. However, no specific changes in the brain and spinal cord that could conclusively explain these neuronal defects have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of continuous ethanol exposure during early gestation on the peripheral nerve, towards the understanding of neuronal disorders in FAS. A chick model of FAS was used and embryos were exposed to 5%, 10% and 15% ethanol on embryonic days 1-8. The effects on general growth and development, and on the peripheral nerve of ethanol-exposed embryos were examined following the full period of gestation. There was significant reduction in crown rump length, head circumference and body weight in ethanol exposed chicks when compared with appropriate control groups. The growth retardation among the different alcohol exposed groups was dose dependent and prenatal mortality of embryos was seen in embryos exposed to 10% and 15% ethanol. Features of myclin degeneration were observed in the peripheral nerve in majority of chick embryos exposed to 10% and 15% ethanol as compared to embryos exposed to 5% ethanol as well as in the control groups. Thus, this study demonstrates the dose dependent effects of continuous prenatal ethanol exposure in a chick model of FAS. More significantly, it demonstrates the detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing peripheral nerve.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Background: Peer relationship problems are a significant part of the clinical presentation of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Many of these children have been prescribed psychotropic medications by community practitioners. The present study reports on the interaction between medication status and parent and teacher-reported outcomes for parent-assisted Children's Friendship Training (CFT). Methods: Seventy seven children (40 boys and 37 girls, age range was 71-139 months) diagnosed with FASD were given 12 sessions of CFT. Parent- and teacher-reported social outcomes were compared across four subgroups of children who were prescribed either stimulant or neuroleptic medication, neither or both types of medications. Results: According to parent and teacher reports, children prescribed neuroleptic medication showed greater improvement on all outcome measures when compared to children not prescribed neuroleptics. In contrast, children prescribed stimulant medication either failed to show improvement or showed poorer outcomes when compared to children not prescribed stimulants. Implications: Children with FASD frequently present with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. The present results suggest physicians routinely ask about prenatal alcohol exposure as part of history taking to treat children more effectively who appear to be displaying attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptomatology but who may have FASD.

N2  - Typically, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are not diagnosed in children until developmental problems become apparent. To diagnose these children earlier would benefit both them and their caregivers. Neonatal cranial ultrasound has great potential diagnostic utility in the presence of known heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, in that it allows us to gather critical neuroanatomical information before the fontanel closes. This report describes the case of Baby S, in which the neonatal ultrasound was crucial in obtaining early fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) diagnosis and facilitating an array of interventions for which the baby would not otherwise have been eligible. Now four years old, Baby S has received care in many different forms, and is making substantial progress. The early FAS diagnosis and subsequent interventions may have ameliorated, and continue to ameliorate, the poor developmental prognosis for many individuals with FASD.

N2  - Alcohol is produced via the anaerobic fermentation of sugars by yeast and involves glucose molecules (C6H12O6) being broken down to yield ethanol (C2H5OH), carbon dioxide (CO5) and energy. The amount of alcohol contained in different alcoholic beverages varies considerably and is referred to as the 'strength' of the drink, which is expressed as the percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV). A standard unit of alcohol in the UK equates to 8g or 10ml of pure alcohol. Guidelines for sensible drinking set by the UK government are 3-4 units (24-32g) a day or less for men, and 2-3 units (16-24g) a day or less for women. Specific recommendations have been set for those planning pregnancy and pregnant women, who should drink no more than 1-2 units of alcohol once or twice a week and should avoid heavy drinking sessions. Guidelines for sensible drinking are similar in other countries. When taking into account the standard drink unit used to define guidelines, the most commonly recommended limit is 24g/day for men and 20g/day for women. Older people are more likely to drink in line with the sensible drinking guidelines, as they tend to consume alcohol over a period of time, as opposed to consuming large quantities on one or two days of the week, a practice that is more popular among younger people. Consuming double the sensible drinking guidelines in one day is classified as binge drinking (an alternative definition is drinking until intoxicated). It has become recognised that binge drinking is a common phenomenon in the UK, particularly among younger people. Other factors, such as income, ethnicity and region of residence, are also recognised to be predictive of the quantity of alcohol consumed; for example, higher-income households are more likely to consume large quantities of alcohol and consume alcohol more frequently. The quantity of alcohol consumed is an important factor in determining how it affects health and well-being. In terms of nutritional health, chronic excessive alcohol intake is well recognised to affect an individual's nutrient status, because it reduces food intake and/or may interfere with the digestion, absorption, metabolism and utilisation of some nutrients. However, when consumed in moderation, alcohol is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of nutrients or be associated with impaired vitamin function or depletion to an extent that may harm health, provided that dietary intakes are adequate. Alcoholic beverages contain alcohol, carbohydrate and only small amounts of some vitamins, trace elements and minerals. They are therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to micronutrient intake. Any association that exists between moderate alcohol consumption and the absorption and metabolism of nutrients from the diet is dependant on a number of factors, including: the nutrient in question; habitual intake of the nutrient and the nutritional status of the individual; and the quantity of alcohol consumed over a period of time. Overall, little information exists about the implications of binge drinking on nutrient status; but it may alter food intake, and excessive alcohol consumption can cause disturbances to the digestive system. While infrequent binge drinking is unlikely to have any long-term nutritional implications (although it may affect nutrient status in the short-term), regular binge drinking may have a more negative impact. Although alcoholic beverages tend to have few nutrients, they can be a significant source of energy, as alcohol provides 7kcal per gram. Studies indicate that alcoholic beverages are usually additive to an individual's normal energy intake and individuals are unlikely to compensate for energy from them during the day. The aperitif effect of alcohol may also encourage an increase in energy intake. It is therefore not surprising that alcohol intake has been associated with weight gain and an increase in body mass index (BMI) (with the exception of chronic excessive drinkers). However, there are a number of methodological problems that need to be considered when comparing the findings of studies investigating the association between alcohol intake and disease risk, including: potential misreporting of total intake; the use of an appropriate control group; and the need for comparable measurement units. Consumption of alcoholic beverages has also been associated with increasing the risk of ill-health associated with pre-existing conditions. For example, it may contribute to ulcer development or aggravate symptoms of existing ulcers. There is evidence that moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy may affect the development of the fetus's central nervous system, and may result in low birthweight. However, there is currently no consensus as to whether alcohol should be completely avoided during pregnancy. However, it is well recognised that excess alcohol consumption during pregnancy can put the fetus at risk of fetal alcohol syndrome. Quantity of alcohol consumed is particularly important when considering the association between alcohol and chronic diseases; for example, there is now strong evidence that light to moderate (1-3 drinks per day) consumption decreases the risk of a coronary heart disease (CHD) episode compared with abstainers (with particular benefits in men aged over 55years and post-menopausal women). However, heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of CHD. Further information is required to determine the association between drinking patterns and heart health. However, there is a consensus of opinion that it is the alcohol per se that influences heart health, rather than a particular type of alcoholic beverage; and other factors that affect an individual's choice of drink may be important in distorting the findings from studies that show otherwise. As with risk of CHD, light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk (of 30-40%) of type 2 diabetes, when compared with teetotallers. Heavy drinking may be associated with an increased risk, resulting in a 'J' or 'U' shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. A 'J' shaped relationship has also been reported between alcohol consumption and blood pressure. It is widely accepted that heavy alcohol intake is a risk factor for high blood pressure, and evidence indicates that moderate intakes may exert a short-term lowering effect, while abstainers/teetotallers are reported to have a higher blood pressure. The type of stroke is important when considering the association between stroke and alcohol, as any alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke, but low intakes (i.e. one drink per day) may have a protective effect on ischaemic stroke. Heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of both types of stroke. Alcohol intake has also been associated with an increased risk of cancers at a number of sites. However, a consensus for a likely causal association has only been identified between alcohol and cancers of the upper-aero digestive tract and liver. The mechanisms to explain the positive associations between alcohol and breast cancer, and alcohol and colorectal cancer, have yet to be identified. It is unclear whether some types of alcoholic beverage are more strongly associated with increased risk of cancer than others. Mechanisms identified to date suggest that it is the alcohol per se that exerts damage and, therefore, quantity of alcohol consumed is the most important variable. Studies looking at the relationship between alcohol and mortality suggest that 10-80g (approximately 1-8 drinks) of alcohol each week is optimal to reap the health benefits, but increased risk is noted at higher intakes (thus indicating a 'U' shaped relationship between alcohol intake and mortality). Gender and age are important factors when considering the association between alcohol and mortality. For example, for younger people, the benefits of alcohol may be outweighed by the increased risk of other diseases (e.g. alcohol-related cancers, liver cirrhosis) and increased risk of violence and accidents. Aggressive behaviour, increased risk taking and decreased responsiveness to social expectations, which may lead to personal 'harm', including accidents and violence, are usually the result of alcohol intoxication (i.e. through binge drinking). Excess alcohol consumption may also result in a 'hangover', which disrupts normal life through symptoms of fatigue and increased anxiety, and has economic consequences in the workplace through poor performance or absenteeism. The extent to which a hangover can affect an individual's performance, including psychomotor, recognition and managerial skills, is still being debated. Binge drinking is also associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies. Although the cost of binge drinking in terms of long-term health has yet to be established, the significant economic cost is well recognised. A number of population-based initiatives are underway to try and change the 'drinking culture', and thus reduce the incidence of binge drinking. Initiatives include: advertising campaigns; changes to alcohol advertising regulations; and changes to pub licensing regulations. © 2006 British Nutrition Foundation.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects brain structure and function. This study examined brain metabolism using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and searched for regions of specific vulnerability in adolescents and young adults prenatally exposed to alcohol. Methods: Ten adolescents and young adults with confirmed heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and a diagnosis within the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were included. Three of them had fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 3 had partial FAS (PFAS), and 4 had alcohol-related neurobehavioral disorder (ARND). The control group consisted of 10 adolescents matched for age, sex, head circumference, handedness, and body mass. Exclusionary criteria were learning disorders and prenatal alcohol exposure. Three-dimensional 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( 1H MRSI) was performed in the cerebrum and cerebellum. Metabolite ratios N-acetylaspartate/choline (NAA/Cho), NAA/creatine (Cr) and Cho/Cr, and absolute metabolite intensities were calculated for several anatomic regions. Results: In patients with FASD, lower NAA/Cho and/or NAA/Cr compared with controls were found in parietal and frontal cortices, frontal white matter, corpus callosum, thalamus, and cerebellar dentate nucleus. There was an increase in the absolute intensity of the glial markers Cho and Cr but no change in the neuronal marker NAA. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure alters brain metabolism in a long-standing or permanent manner in multiple brain areas. These changes are in accordance with previous findings from structural and functional studies. Metabolic alterations represent changes in the glial cell pool rather than in the neurons.

N2  - Background: Researchers are increasingly considering the importance of motor functioning of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The purpose of this study was to assess the motor development of young children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) to determine the presence and degree of delay in their motor skills and to compare their motor development with that of matched children without FAS. Methods: The motor development of 14 children ages 20 to 68 months identified with FAS was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). In addition, 2 comparison groups were utilized. Eleven of the children with FAS were matched for chronological age, gender, ethnicity, and communication age to: (1) 11 children with prenatal alcohol exposure who did not have FAS and (2) 11 matched children without any reported prenatal alcohol exposure. The motor scores on the VABS were compared among the 3 groups. Results: Most of the young children with FAS in this study showed clinically important delays in their motor development as measured on the VABS Motor Domain, and their fine motor skills were significantly more delayed than their gross motor skills. In the group comparisons, the young children with FAS had significantly lower Motor Domain standard (MotorSS) scores than the children not exposed to alcohol prenatally. They also had significantly lower Fine Motor Developmental Quotients than the children in both the other groups. No significant group differences were found in gross motor scores. For MotorSS scores and Fine Motor Developmental Quotients, the means and standard errors indicated a continuum in the scores from FAS to prenatal alcohol exposure to nonexposure. Conclusions: These findings strongly suggest that all young children with FAS should receive complete developmental evaluations that include assessment of their motor functioning, to identify problem areas and provide access to developmental intervention programs that target deficit areas such as fine motor skills. Fine motor delays in children with FAS may be related to specific neurobehavioral deficits that affect fine motor skills. The findings support the concept of an FASD continuum in some areas of motor development. Copyright © 2006 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) offer unique, noninvasive methods of measuring, respectively, in vivo quantitative neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. The main purpose of the present study was to identify and compare the neuroanatomical and neurochemical abnormalities that are associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol in both fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)-diagnosed children and those diagnosed with fetal alcohol effects (FAE). MR data of three age-, gender- and race-balanced groups of children, FAS-diagnosed, FAE-diagnosed and non-exposed controls, were compared. Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, regardless of diagnosis, were found in the caudate nucleus. Specifically, a significantly smaller caudate nucleus was found for the FAS and FAE participants compared to the controls. In addition, the metabolite ratio of N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr), an indicator of neuronal function, in left caudate nucleus of both the FAS and FAE participants was elevated compared to the control group. Analysis of absolute concentrations revealed that the increase in the ratio of NAA/Cr was due to an increase in NAA alone. Although its exact function in the CNS is unknown, NAA is believed to be a neuronal marker due to its exclusive localization to neurons. Some also speculate a role for NAA in myelination. Elevated NAA in the prenatal alcohol-exposed participants could indicate a lack of normal program cell death, dendritic pruning and/or myelination during development. The present study demonstrates that prenatal alcohol-exposed children, with or without facial dysmorphology, have abnormal brain anatomy and chemistry. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The behavioral problems and cognitive deficits resulting from even small amounts of prenatal alcohol exposure can be significant and enduring but completely preventable. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a prenatal drinking goal selected during a brief intervention for 115 pregnant women and their partners on subsequent consumption. Higher proportions of women having their first pregnancy chose abstinence as a goal over drinking reduction. Goal selection was highly predictive of subsequent drinking behavior. Interestingly, the participants who were abstinent at enrollment and who chose to remain abstinent had the highest rates of abstinence. In contrast, the women who chose cutting down on drinking were the least likely to drink less subsequently, despite recognizing more situations putting them at risk for drinking and identifying more alternatives to consumption. We conclude that goal choice in behavioral self-management of alcohol use by pregnant women is critical. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Effect of a single dose of ethanol on developing peripheral nerve of chick embryos
A1  - Chaudhuri J.D.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Fetal Alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy. It is characterized by physical and mental growth retardation, craniofacial anomalies and derangements of numerous body systems. A particular distressing feature of FAS is affection of the nervous system, which manifest as motor and sensory derangements and neurobehavioral deficits. However, no specific changes in the brain and spinal cord that could conclusively explain these neuronal defects have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single high dose of ethanol exposure during early gestation on the peripheral nerve, with a view to understanding the neuronal disorders appearing in FAS. A chick model of FAS was used and embryos were exposed to 5%, 10% and 15% ethanol immediately after hatching. The effects on general growth and development and on the peripheral nerve of ethanol-exposed embryos were examined following the full period of gestation. There was a significant reduction in crown-rump length, head circumference and body weight in ethanol-exposed chicks as compared with appropriate control groups. The degree of growth retardation among the different alcohol exposed groups was dose dependent and significant prenatal embryo mortality was seen in those exposed to 15% ethanol. In embryos that survived the exposure to 15% ethanol, features of myelin degeneration were observed in the peripheral nerve in the majority of cases. No features of myelin degeneration were observed in embryos exposed to 5% and 10% ethanol or in the control groups. This study demonstrates the direct toxic effects of a single high dose of ethanol on developing embryos in general and the peripheral nerves in particular. Accordingly the pathological changes observed in peripheral nerves could account for some of the neurobehavioral deficits observed in FAS.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is associated with macrostructural brain abnormalities, neurocognitive deficits, and behavioral disturbances, is characterized as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in severe cases. The only published study thus far using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed microstructural abnormalities in patients with FAS. The current study investigated whether similar abnormalities are present in less severely affected, prenatally exposed patients who did not display all of the typical FAS physical stigmata. Methods: Subjects included 14 children, ages 10 to 13, with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and 13 matched controls. Cases with full-criteria FAS, mental retardation, or microcephaly were excluded. Subjects underwent MRI scans including DTI. Results: Although cases with microcephaly were excluded, there was a trend toward smaller total cerebral volume in the FASD group (p=0.057, Cohen's d effect size =0.73). Subjects with FASD had greater mean diffusivity (MD) in the isthmus of the corpus callosum than controls (p=0.013, effect size =1.05), suggesting microstructural abnormalities in this region. There were no group differences in 5 other regions of the corpus callosum. Correlations between MD in the isthmus and facial dysmorphology were nonsignificant. Conclusions: These results suggest that even relatively mild forms of fetal alcohol exposure may be associated with microstructural abnormalities in the posterior corpus callosum that are detectable with DTI.

N2  - Background: This work was conducted in an effort to establish an oral intake model system in which the effects of ethanol insult that occur during early stages of embryogenesis can be easily examined and in which agents that may modulate ethanol's teratogenicity can be readily tested in vivo. The model system described utilizes the alcohol deprivation effect to obtain teratogenic levels of maternal ethanol intake on days 7 and 8 of pregnancy in C57Bl/6J mice. Ocular defects including microphthalmia and uveal coloboma, which have previously been shown to result from ethanol administered by gavage or via intraperitoneal injection on these days, served as the developmental end point for this study. The ocular defects are readily identifiable and their degree of severity is expected to correlate with concurrently developing defects of the central nervous system (CNS). Methods: Female C57Bl/6J mice were maintained on an ethanol-containing (4.8% v/v) liquid diet for 14 days and then mated during a subsequent abstinence period. Mice were then reexposed to ethanol on days 7 and 8 of pregnancy only. Control as well as ethanol-exposed dams were killed on their 14th day of pregnancy. Fetuses were then weighed, measured for crown rump length, photographed, and analyzed for ocular abnormalities. Globe size, palpebral fissure length, and pupil size and shape were noted for both the right and left eyes of all fetuses and informative comparisons were made. Results: This exposure paradigm resulted in peak maternal blood alcohol concentrations that ranged from 170 to 220 mg/dL on gestational day (GD) 8. Compared with the GD 14 fetuses from the normal control group, the pair-fed, acquisition controls, as well as the ethanol-exposed fetuses, were developmentally delayed and had reduced weights. Confirming previous studies, comparison of similarly staged control and treated GD 8 embryos illustrated reductions in the size of the forebrain in the latter. Subsequent ocular malformations were noted in 33% of the right eyes and 25% of the left eyes of the 103 GD 14 ethanol-exposed fetuses examined. This incidence of defects is twice that observed in the control groups. Additionally, it was found that the palpebral fissure length is directly correlated with globe size. Conclusions: The high incidence of readily identifiable ocular malformations produced by oral ethanol intake in this model and their relevance to human fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) makes this an excellent system for utilization in experiments involving factors administered to the embryo that might alter ethanol's teratogenic effects. Additionally, the fact that early ethanol insult yields ocular and forebrain abnormalities that are developmentally associated allows efficient specimen selection for subsequent detailed analyses of CNS effects in this in vivo mammalian FASD model.

N2  - Objective: This study explored the extent to which the high frequency of psychiatric problems reported in clinical groups with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders might also be observed in a nonclinical group of young adults and the psychiatric conditions that are related to prenatal alcohol exposure in this group. Method: From a longitudinal prospective study beginning with interviews of 1,529 pregnant women, a birth cohort of about 500 newborns was chosen to include all of the most heavily alcohol exposed plus a sampling of the continuum of alcohol exposures from total abstinence through heavy drinking. At an average age of 25.7 years, 400 members of this birth cohort were administered valid Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV (SCID), including both the SCID for axis I disorders and the SCID for axis II personality disorders. Results: The odds of the appearance of six psychiatric disorders and traits were more than double in adults exposed to one or more binge alcohol episodes in utero. Three of these six odds ratios were uniformly stable against confounding: axis I substance dependence or abuse disorders and axis II passive-aggressive and antisocial personality disorders or traits. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to alcohol may be a risk factor for specific psychiatric disorders and traits in early adulthood, even in a nonclinical group.

N2  - Aims: To compare the incorporation rate (ICR) of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) in hair between guinea pigs and humans, and to assess the relationship between ethanol exposure and FAEE concentrations in hair. Methods: Published data from pregnant guinea pigs, including maximum blood ethanol concentration (BEC), dosage regimen, and total hair FAEE concentration, were compared with published data from alcoholic patients, where dose of ethanol consumed and total hair FAEE concentration were reported. Mean values of ethanol Vmax for pregnant guinea pigs and humans were obtained from published data (26.2 and 24 mg/dl/h, respectively). Results: Total and individual FAEE ICRs, defined as the ratio of hair FAEE to the area under the BEC-time curve (total systemic ethanol exposure), were found to be on average an order of magnitude lower in the guinea pig than in the human. The profiles of ester incorporation also differed slightly between species, with ethyl stearate being highly incorporated in guinea pig hair and less so in human hair. The results may reflect in the human greater FAEE production, greater FAEE deposition in hair, slower FAEE catabolism, differential sebum production and composition, or a combination thereof. Also, ethyl oleate was found to correlate with total systemic ethanol exposure for both guinea pigs and humans, correlation coefficients equalling 0.67 (P < 0.05) and 0.49 (P < 0.05), respectively. No other ethyl esters, nor total FAEE, were found to correlate with systemic ethanol exposure. Conclusion: When extrapolating FAEE concentrations in hair from guinea pigs to humans, an order of magnitude difference should be considered, with humans incorporating more FAEE per unit of ethanol exposure. Also, the results suggest caution should be taken when interpreting values of single esters because of their differential incorporation among species. Lastly, our findings suggest ethyl oleate may be of keen interest in FAEE hair analysis, particularly across species. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

N2  - Adverse sequelae of prenatal alcohol exposure include executive function and social skills impairments, although these two domains have not been empirically linked in alcohol-exposed individuals. This study investigated this relationship using the BRIEF and the SSRS in 98 children aged 6 to 11 years. Executive functions explained a significant percentage of variance in parent and teacher rated social skills. No differences were found among children with diagnoses of FAS, partial FAS, or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. It may be helpful to consider executive functioning in designing social skills interventions for alcohol-exposed children whether or not they have full FAS. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Context: Little is known about the contribution of fetal alcohol exposure to the development of alcohol disorders in early adulthood. Objective: To examine the independent effect of maternal alcohol use during early vs late periods in pregnancy on the time of onset of alcohol disorders in offspring. Design: Follow-up study of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy and Its Outcomes (MUSP), a population-based birth cohort study commenced in Brisbane, Australia, in 1981 and designed to examine the association of maternal alcohol exposure with the onset of alcohol disorders. Mothers and children were followed up at birth, 6 months, and 5, 14, and 21 years after the initial interview. Maternal alcohol use was assessed before pregnancy, in early and late pregnancy, and at the 5- and 14-year follow-up visits. Alcohol disorders in early adulthood were assessed at age 21 years using the lifetime version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-computerized version. Setting: Population-based birth cohort study. Participants: A subsample of 2138 participants for whom complete data were available at the 21-year follow-up. Main Outcome Measure: Onset of alcohol disorder from adolescence to 21 years of age. Results: In utero alcohol exposure of 3 or more glasses was associated with alcohol disorders. The fully adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of developing early-onset alcohol disorders at age 21 years were 2.95 (1.62-5.36) for those exposed to maternal drinking in early pregnancy and 1.35 (0.69-2.63) for those exposed in late pregnancy. There was also a strong association between alcohol exposure in early pregnancy and late-onset alcohol disorders (odds ratio, 3.29 [95% confidence interval, 1.74-6.24]). Conclusions: Our results provide support for a biological origin of adult alcohol disorders and suggest that the association is not explained solely by maternal drinking or smoking during childhood and adolescence or other intervening factors. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the association. ©2006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Accurate estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in a Western European population are lacking and are of particular interest in settings where the usual pattern of alcohol consumption is thought to be daily drinking with meals. To address these issues, an epidemiology study of FAS and other FASD was undertaken in Italian schools. Methods: Primary schools (n=25) in 2 health districts of the Lazio region were randomly selected and recruited for the study. Five hundred forty-three children, 50% of those enrolled in first-grade classes, received parental permission to participate in a 2-tiered, active case ascertainment screening process. Detailed evaluation of children selected in a preliminary screening phase was carried out on those who were small for height, weight, and head circumference and/or referred by teachers for suspected learning and behavioral problems. Detailed evaluation was carried out on each child's: (1) physical growth and dysmorphology, (2) psychological development and behavior, and (3) prenatal exposure to alcohol and other risk factors for FASD via maternal interviews. A group of 67 randomly selected children without FASD from the same classes was utilized as a comparison group. Results: Using 2 denominators for prevalence estimation, a conservative one and a strict sample-based estimate, the prevalence of FAS in this province of Italy was 3.7 to 7.4 per 1,000 children. When cases of partial FAS (PFAS) and a case of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental deficits (ARND) were added to FAS cases, the rate of FASD was 20.3 to 40.5 per 1,000 and estimated at 35 per 1,000 overall or between 2.3 and 4.1% of all children. This exceeds previously published estimates of both FAS and FASD for the western world. Detailed data are presented that demonstrate the utility of the guidelines of the revised Institute of Medicine diagnostic criteria for FASD. Children with FASD are significantly more impaired/affected (p<0.05) than randomly selected comparison children on all measures of growth deficiency, key facial features of FASD, overall dysmorphology scores, language comprehension, nonverbal IQ, and behavior. Maternal reports of current drinking were significantly higher for mothers of FASD children than comparison mothers, but reported rates of overall drinking during pregnancy were not significantly different. In contrast to expectations, daily drinking among mothers of the comparison group was not common. However, dysmorphology scores of the children were significantly correlated with drinking in the second and third trimesters, drinks per current drinking day, and current drinks per month. Finally, children with the physical features of FASD had lower IQs; nonverbal IQ was significantly correlated with head circumference and negatively correlated with overall dysmorphology score, smooth philtrum, and several other facial and physical anomalies characteristic of FAS. Conclusions: Using careful measures of ascertainment in a primary school setting, these results provide relatively high estimates of the prevalence of FASD and raise the question of whether FASD is more common in the western world than previously estimated.

N2  - Ancient scripture and paintings together with several medical reports on the effect of alcohol on the newborn over the past 300 years finally led to the description of the fetal alcohol syndrome in the 1970s by French and American research groups. Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can result in the specific pattern of malformations and neurocognitive deficits characteristic of this syndrome. Diagnostic criteria and classifications have been developed and in the 1990s reports showed the long-term consequences for these children. In recent years several studies from different countries have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure will lead to life-long consequences on physical development, intellectual development, behavior, social development, occupation, independence, sexuality or sexual behavior and increased risk of suicidality. In this review of long-term observation studies we found that the prenatal exposure to alcohol have permanent and life-long damage, which impair both the social and occupational future of the person exposed with a need for life-long assistance in order for that person to function at an optimal level. Primary prevention and early intervention with general public health educational efforts seems to be the best way forward.

N2  - Aim: To investigate whether exogenous thyroxine (T4) treatment to alcohol-fed dams would ameliorate the detrimental effects of alcohol syndromes on the postnatal development of the offspring with brain injury. Methods: This study was investigated in the Laboratory of Neuroanatomy, Chosun University from September 2003 to August 2004. Thirty-six time-pregnant SD rats were divided into four groups on the 6th day of gestation: Alcohol group (n=6) received 147 J calories of 20 mL alcohol (22%) every day; Control group (n=6) was fed with a daily liquid diet in 35 mL dextrin replacing alcohol isocalorically; Alcohol+T4 group (n=6) received 147 J calories of 20 mL alcohol (22%) diet and 5 mug/kg exogenous T4 subcutaneously; Surrogate group (n=18) intook food normally. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture, under anesthesia, from each dam within 6 hours after its last pup was born. The plasma concentrations of alcohol and T4 were determined at the Department of Clinical Laboratory, Chosun University Hospital, and were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Pups of alcohol, control and alcohol+T4 groups were fostered by surrogate mothers, and executed at anesthesia at postnatal 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days for measuring the distribution and form of nerve cells containing neuropeptide Y (NPY) via immunohistochemistry as well as the number of NPY-containing neurons in the V and VI layers of cerebral cortex. Results: A total of 18 mother rats and 90 pups were involved in the result analysis. 1 A similar developmental pattern of mature NPY-containing neurons was observed in both control and alcohol+T4 groups on and after the postnatal 14 days. Many of these cells were bipolar or multipolar in shape and their processes had increased in length and thickness, and then their fibers and terminals formed a rich network. In contrast, the maturation of NPY-immunoreactive neurons was not found in alcohol group. 2 The alcohol concentration was higher in alcohol group and alcohol+T4 group than in control group, with significant difference [(0.015 +/-0.006)%, (0.012+/-0.005)%, 0, P=0.014]; T4 concentration was significantly higher in alcohol+T4 group than in alcohol group [(33+/-6), (22+/-4) mug/L, P=0.022].3 The obvious decrease of NPY-containing neurons was observed in alcohol group compared to control group at all ages, and significant reduction of NPY-containing neurons was found after 14 days of birth [(16.3 +/-1.3), (27.8+/-1.0)/ cm2, P < 0.0001]. The number of NPY-containing neurons in alcohol+T4 group was equal to that of alcohol group, and differed significantly from that of control group only on the birthday [(5.3+/-0.7), (10.5 +/-0.8)/cm2, P < 0.001]. However, the difference was insignificant on other days (P > 0.05). Compared with alcohol group, the number of NPY-containing neurons was elevated on the postnatal 7 days in alcohol+T4 group, with the significant difference [(14.2+/-1.7), (8.5+/-0.9)/cm2, P < 0.05], and with the extremely significant difference on the postnatal 14 days [(28.7 +/-1.1), (16.3+/-1.3)/cm2, P < 0.0001]. Conclusion: The NPY synthesis of cerebral cortex and growth of NPY-containing neurons caused by maternal administration of exogenous T4 may convalesce fetal alcoholic syndromes, one of which is the T4-induced developmental disorder following maternal alcohol abuse.

N2  - Women who drink while pregnant are at a high risk of giving birth to children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Heavy consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is also known to be deleterious to fetal bone growth in both humans and laboratory animals. However, nothing is known regarding the effect of maternal moderate and heavy alcohol binging on fetal and maternal bone strength. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of moderate and heavy alcohol binging throughout gestation on fetal and maternal bone growth and strength. The study was conducted using an ovine model system. The large body mass of the ovine fetus, the longer gestation that is more similar to that of humans, and the fact that all three trimester equivalents occur in utero, make the sheep an excellent model for studying Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Suffolk ewes were mated and, beginning on gestational day 4, received intravenous infusions over 1 h on 3 consecutive days per week followed by 4 days without treatment concluding on day 132 of pregnancy. Pregnant ewes were divided into four groups: two alcohol treatment groups (0.75 and 1.75 g/kg of body weight), one pair-fed saline control group, and an untreated normal control group. The fetuses were harvested on gestational day 133. Maternal and fetal femoral and tibial dimensions were measured and the maximum strength (MPa) carried by the bone tissue was determined using a three-point bending procedure. Maternal bones were not different among groups. The higher alcohol dose resulted in reduced fetal femoral bone strength, whereas the tibial bone strength was lower when compared with the normal control subjects. In contrast, the lower alcohol dose increased fetal femoral strength compared to the normal control subjects. The alcohol-exposed fetal bones also tended to exhibit reduced lengths. We conclude that binge alcohol exposure throughout gestation resulted in dose-dependent differences in the maximum stress absorbed by the fetal bones. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - In Italy, little is known about the problems related to alcohol drinking during pregnancy. In this paper, the Italian literature about this subject is briefly reviewed. This first Italian experience of a field study, aimed to the assessment of the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in an area in the Rome province (Lazio region) is reported. This in-field study was performed in the school years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 in cooperation with American researchers, most from University of New Mexico (Albuquerque), and Italian researchers from University "la Sapienza" of Rome. First grade children (ndegree = 1086) of primary school were contacted to enter in the in-school study for the detection of FAS and FASD and were examined by the experts team of clinicians, pediatrics, psychologists. Preliminary consideration and the implications of this study for FASD prevention are discussed.

N2  - Over thirty years of research has revealed that prenatal exposure to alcohol has a devastating impact on the structure and function of the developing central nervous system. Imaging studies over the past ten years have improved our understanding of the structural alterations related to prenatal alcohol exposure and provided researchers with potential hypotheses for brain-behavior relationships. Structural alterations associated with prenatal alcohol exposure have been found in overall brain size, shape, and symmetry, along with regional decreases in white and gray matter. In addition, abnormalities have been noted in specific structures such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. This review demonstrates that specific areas of the brain may be more vulnerable to prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a large and rapidly increasing public health problem worldwide. Aside the full-blown FAS, multiple terms are used to describe the continuum of effects that result from prenatal exposure to alcohol, including the whole fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The revised Institute of Medicine (IOM) Diagnostic Classification System and the diagnostic criteria for FAS and FASD are reported, as well as the formation of the four-state FAS International Consortium and its aims, as the development of an information base that systematizes data collection that helps to determine at-high-risk populations, and to implement and test a scientific-based prevention/intervention model for at risk women. The Consortium was further enlarged, with the inclusion of some more states (including Italy), leading to the formation of the International Consortium for the Investigation of FASD. The objectives of the Consortium are reported, as well as its previous activities, the South Africa and Italy Projects (active case ascertainment initiatives), and its future activities.

N2  - Objective: In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), we have previously found an alteration in NMDA receptors suggesting mediation, at least in part, of alcohol-related learning deficit. NMDA and GABA receptors interact in a multisynaptic circuit for the regulation of the inhibitory tone through the CNS. The GABA receptor subunit GABAAalpha5 is involved in learning and is developmentally regulated, as it is excitatory in the perinatal brain and inhibitory in the adult. We were interested to evaluate alcohol's effect on GABAAalpha5 expression to further understand alcohol-induced learning dysfunction. Study design: Timed, pregnant C57B16/Jmice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol, 0.03 mL/kg ip) or control (saline). Embryos and brains were harvested 10 days after treatment, and brains from adult offspring were collected after evaluation in the Morris Water Maze, a well-established test for spatial learning. Gene expression included samples from at least 3 litters per timepoint, and calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to quantify GABAAalpha5 with GAPDH standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure significantly decreased GABAAalpha5 expression in the embryo (P < .02) and fetal brains (P < .01) 10 days after therapy. However, in adult brains GABAAalpha5 expression was increased versus controls (P < .01). As previously demonstrated, prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in deficits in adults learning the Morris Water Maze with controls learning faster (P < .05). Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure alters developmental GABAAalpha5 expression. This may further explain the long-lasting damage of alcohol on learning skills. Both the alcohol-induced reduction in the GABAAalpha5 subunit during development and up-regulation in adult brain may be related to learning deficits resulting in decreased learning potential caused by the developmental defect and an increased inhibition of learning resulting from increased expression as an adult. In combination with our previous findings, these suggest that alcohol-induced learning impairment is likely the result of alterations of both NMDA and GABA expression and function. © 2006 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are among the leading preventable causes of developmental disorders in the United States; however, recognition and prevention of these conditions cannot be achieved without informed and educated health providers. This commentary addresses the importance of recognition and prevention of FASDs through the use of well-established standardized practices of diagnosis, screening, and brief alcohol reduction counseling. It is hoped that more knowledge on currently available procedures will encourage their use in the provision of routine health care to all women of childbearing age.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This study examined the ability of infants prenatally exposed to alcohol to regulate their affect during and after a stressor. Specifically, the Still-Face Paradigm (Tronick, Als, Adamson, Wise, & Brazelton, 1978) was used as a stress induction paradigm to assess both mother-infant interaction and infant self-regulation. In addition to the mothers' interactive style, the effect of mothers' drinking during and after pregnancy on the infant was explored. Participants were 76 six-month-old infants and their mothers. Infant affect and maternal interaction style was coded second-by-second for the 6 min of the Still-Face Paradigm. Results indicated that infants whose mothers made fewer attempts at engaging them during the play portion of the still-face (e.g., either watched their infant or paid minimal attention to their infant) showed greater negative affect in contrast to infants whose mothers played in an interactive manner. A gender effect was found among female infants. That is, female infants whose mothers drank more during pregnancy showed greater negative affect. The study demonstrates the possibility of early identification of negativity in infants with prenatal alcohol exposure. The impact of mother-child relationship on emotional regulation of infants prenatally alcohol exposed may be a target of future intervention and further study. © 2006 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

T1  - Brain deficits associated with fetal alcohol exposure may be protected, in part, by peptides derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein
A1  - Sari Y.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This review discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain and the potential use of derived peptides from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) in neuroprotection against the insults of alcohol. Alcohol is known to impede the growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through cellular apoptosis. Sari et al. have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure reduced the fetal brain weight, the size of the brain regions and the number of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure compromises neural tube midline development. Sari et al. further suggested that the timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy is critical to the induction of deficits in 5-HT neurons, as well as other types of neurons and consequently results in deficits in neural tube development. ADNF and ADNP are glial-derived proteins discovered to be induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These proteins are expressed during embryonic development. Functional assays and genetic manipulations have identified these proteins as highly important for neural tube closure and brain formation/development. The peptide derivatives of ADNF, ADNF-14 (VLGGGSALLRSIPA), ADNF-9 (or SALLRSIPA = SAL) and of ADNP, NAPVSIPQ = NAP have shown neuroprotective effects and have been proven to prevent brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. Here, we discuss the many aspects of alcohol-associated growth restriction in the developing brain and the potential inhibition of this severe phenotype through the use of neuroprotective peptides. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - A retrospective review of self-reported alcohol intake among women attending for antenatal care in Far North Queensland
A1  - Rimmer C.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are known to occur among children delivered to women in Far North Queensland; to date, the problem has not been quantified or related directly to maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Aims: To identify the characteristics of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy, in order to identify 'high-risk' women to whom educational intervention regarding fetal alcohol syndrome may be targeted. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study using the case notes of all women attending the antenatal booking clinic in Cairns Base Hospital over the 3-month period from April to June 2005. Obstetric and demographic information and self-reported alcohol intake before and during pregnancy were noted and self-reported alcohol intake before and during pregnancy. Results: Five hundred and forty-one women were included in this study. Of these women, 24.6% were found to consume alcohol during pregnancy and 57.7% were found to consume alcohol before pregnancy, indicating a reduction in alcohol consumed once women became aware of pregnancy. The most significant indicator for alcohol consumption during pregnancy was found to be alcohol consumption before pregnancy. Of women who consumed alcohol in pregnancy, 71.5% drank moderate amounts of alcohol before pregnancy and 28.7% drank heavily before pregnancy. Conclusion: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is common in Far North Queensland. Methods currently used during antenatal booking visits to determine alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy are unreliable. Strategies to identify women consuming alcohol before and during pregnancy and education programs are vitally important if the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome and spectrum disorder is to be reduced. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading cause of preventable mental retardation and developmental disabilities, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Current medical guidelines recommend that no alcohol should be consumed over the period of conception and throughout pregnancy. Although the majority of women reduce alcohol consumption when they realize they are pregnant, this recognition may not occur until well into the first trimester, potentially impacting embryonic development. Objectives: To describe and assess changes in patterns of women's alcohol use between the preconception, pre-pregnancy recognition and post-pregnancy recognition time periods. Secondly, to describe characteristics of women consuming any alcohol and those binge drinking during pre- and post-pregnancy recognition periods. Methods: Computer assisted telephone interviews were conducted with 1042 women who had recently delivered a baby in urban Alberta, Canada. Differences in consumption patterns between time periods were analyzed using analysis of variance and Chi-square tests. Characteristics of those drinking both before and after pregnancy recognition were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: Eighty percent of women reported alcohol consumption pre-conceptually, 50% pre-pregnancy recognition and 18% post-pregnancy recognition. Binge drinking was reported by 32%, 11% and 0% for preconception, pre-pregnancy recognition and post-pregnancy recognition periods, respectively. Alcohol consumption patterns (i.e., the mean number of drinks per drinking day and week) did not differ significantly between preconception and pre-pregnancy recognition periods but did significantly drop after pregnancy recognition (p<0.001). Alcohol use during the period of pre-pregnancy recognition was higher among those not planning a pregnancy, not using assisted reproductive technology, of higher income, without a history of miscarriage, who were Caucasian, and who used tobacco. Binge drinking was higher among women not planning a pregnancy, those who used tobacco, and those with low self-esteem. Women continuing to drink small amounts of alcohol after pregnancy recognition were more likely to be between the ages of 30-39 years, be Caucasian and use tobacco. Conclusion: Preconception and "well-women" counseling strategies would be improved by increasing the emphasis on the risks of alcohol use during periods when pregnancy can occur. ©2006 Marshfield Clinic.

N2  - Background: In most cases of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), the pathognomonic facial features are absent making diagnosis challenging, if not impossible, particularly when no history of maternal drinking is available. Also because FASD is often comorbid with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), children with FASD are frequently improperly diagnosed and receive the wrong treatment. Since access to psychological testing is typically limited or non-existent in remote areas, other diagnostic methods are needed to provide necessary interventions. Objectives: To determine if a characteristic behavioural phenotype distinguishes children with FASD from typically developing children and children with ADHD and use this information to create a screening tool for FASD diagnosis. Methods: Parents and caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a well-established standardized tool for evaluating children's behavioural problems. Results from 30 children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disability, 30 children with ADHD, and 30 typically developing healthy children matched for age and socioeconomic status with FASD were analyzed. Based on our previous work, 12 CBCL items that significantly differentiated FASD and control groups were selected for further analyses. Stepwise discriminant function analysis identified behavioural characteristics most strongly differentiating groups and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analyses determined sensitivity and specificity of different item combinations. Results: Seven items reflecting hyperactivity, inattention, lying and cheating, lack of guilt, and disobedience significantly differentiated children with FASD from controls. ROC analyses showed scores of 6 or higher on these items differentiated groups with a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 82%. For FASD and ADHD, two combinations of items significantly differentiated groups with high sensitivity and specificity (i) no guilt, cruelty, and acts young (sensitivity = 70%; specificity = 80% (ii) acts young, cruelty, no guilt, lying or cheating, steals from home, and steals outside (sensitivity = 81%; specificity = 72%). These items were used to construct a potential FASD screening tool. Conclusions: Our findings identifying the behavioural characteristics differentiating children with FASD from typically developing children or children with ADHD have the potential for development of an empirically derived tool for FASD tool to be used in remote areas where psychological services are not readily available. This technique may speed up diagnosis and intervention for children without ready access to formal assessments. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related birth defects represent a spectrum of disorders that can result from the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that alcohol exposure in utero adversely affects hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Neonatal mice that were exposed in utero to alcohol showed a marked delay in B lymphocyte development. Recent studies have focused on an oligopotential progenitor cell, with the phenotype of HSAloCD43loLin-, which yields both B cells and myeloid lineage cells at a high frequency when cultured in vitro with stromal cells and the appropriate cytokines. However, these progenitor cells isolated from neonatal offspring of alcohol fed dams showed a significant decrease in the frequency of B cell formation following in vitro culture. In order to understand the mechanism underlying this defect we examined the expression of key transcription factors (early B cell factor, EBF, and Pax5) in this progenitor pool. Here, we report that >95% of HSAloCD43loLin- cells express EBF and 5% express Pax5. Following liquid culture in the presence of IL-7, these progenitor cells respond by up-regulating Pax5 and the surface expression of CD19 indicating that the cells have committed to the B lineage. By contrast 75% of HSAloCD43loLin- cells isolated from the bone marrow of neonatal animals exposed in utero to alcohol expressed EBF but at a level that was less than 25% the level of cells isolated from control animals. Furthermore, these alcohol-exposed progenitor cells failed to up-regulate Pax5 in response to IL-7 indicating a greatly reduced capacity to expand and differentiate to B lineage cells in liquid cultures. However, the HSAloCD43loLin- cells isolated from the alcohol exposed animals retained the capacity to differentiate to myeloid lineage cells. These results suggest that the interference with the sequential expression of transcription factors in early progenitor cells by in utero alcohol exposure is a potential mechanism for the observed decrease in B lymphocytes in neonatal mice. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Biomarkers of fetal exposure to alcohol are important to establish so that early detection and intervention can be made on these infants to prevent undesirable outcomes. The aim of this study was to analyze long-chain fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium as potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure and effect. Methods: Fatty acid ethyl esters were analyzed in the meconium of 124 singleton infants by positive chemical ionization gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and correlated to maternal ethanol use. Results: A total of 124 mother/infant dyads were enrolled in the study: 31 were in the control group and 93 were in the alcohol-exposed group. The incidence (28% vs 9.7%, p=0.037) of ethyl linoleate detected in meconium was significantly higher in the alcohol-exposed groups than the control groups. Similarly, when the concentrations of ethyl linoleate in meconium were grouped (trichotomized), there was a significant linear by linear association between alcohol exposure and group concentrations of ethyl linoleate (p=0.013). Furthermore, only alcohol-exposed infants were found in the group with the highest ethyl linoleate concentration. The sensitivity of ethyl linoleate in detecting prenatal alcohol exposure was only 26.9%, and its specificity and positive predictive value were 96.8 and 96.2%, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the concentration of ethyl linoleate in meconium and absolute alcohol consumed (oz) per drinking day across pregnancy, although a trend toward a positive correlation is seen at lower amounts of alcohol consumed. Among the polyunsaturated, long-chain FAEEs, there was weak evidence that the incidence (21.5% vs 6.5%, p=0.057) and concentration (p=0.064) of ethyl arachidonate (AA) were significantly higher in the alcohol-exposed groups than the control groups. Ethyl linolenate and ethyl docosahexanoate (DHA) in meconium were found only in the alcohol group, although not at statistically significant levels. Highly significant correlations were found among the concentrations of ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, ethyl AA, and ethyl DHA in meconium (correlations ranged between rs=0.203, p=0.024; and rs=0.594, p<0.001). Conclusion: We conclude that FAEEs in meconium, particularly ethyl linoleate and ethyl AA, are biomarkers of high specificity for prenatal exposure to alcohol in newborn infants. We also propose that ethyl AA and DHA could be potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol effects on the developing fetal brain and should be investigated further.

N2  - Attention deficits are a hallmark of the teratogenic effects of alcohol. However, characterization of these deficits remains inconclusive. Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and nonexposed controls were evaluated using a paradigm consisting of three conditions: visual focus, auditory focus, and auditory-visual shift of attention. For the focus conditions, participants responded manually to visual or auditory targets. For the shift condition, participants alternated responses between visual targets and auditory targets. For the visual focus condition, alcohol-exposed children had lower accuracy and slower reaction time for all intertarget intervals (ITIs), while on the auditory focus condition, alcohol-exposed children were less accurate but displayed slower reaction time only on the longest ITI. Finally, for the shift condition, the alcohol-exposed group was accurate but had slowed reaction times. These results indicate that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have pervasive deficits in visual focused attention and deficits in maintaining auditory attention over time. However, no deficits were noted in the ability to disengage and reengage attention when required to shift attention between visual and auditory stimuli, although reaction times to shift were slower.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters limb development that may lead to structural and functional abnormalities of the limb reported in children diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. To determine whether PAE alters the central representation of the forelimb we used the rodent barrel cortex as our model system where it was possible to visualize and quantitatively measure the size of the forepaw representation in the forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) in first somatosensory cortex. In the present study, we examined the effects of PAE on pattern and size of the forepaw and forepaw representation in FBS in neonatal rats at gestational day 32 that corresponds to postnatal day 9. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically intubated with binge doses of ethanol (6 g/kg) from gestational day 1 through gestational day 20. The offspring of the ethanol treated dams comprised the ethanol (EtOH) group. The effect of PAE on the EtOH group was compared with a nutritional-controlled pairfed (PF) group and a normal chowfed (CF) group. The ventral (glabrous) surface area of the forepaw digits, length of digit 2 through digit 5, and the corresponding glabrous forepaw digit representations in the FBS were measured and compared between treatment groups. In rats exposed to in utero alcohol, the sizes of the overall glabrous forepaw and forepaw digits were significantly reduced in EtOH pups compared to CF and PF pups; overall glabrous forepaw area was 11% smaller than CF controls. Glabrous digit lengths were also smaller in EtOH rats compared to CF controls and significantly smaller in digit 2 through digit 4. The glabrous digit representation in FBS was 18% smaller in the EtOH group when compared to the CF treatment. However, PAE did not produce malformations in the forepaw or alter the pattern of the forepaw representation in FBS; instead, PAE significantly reduced both body and brain weights compared to controls. Unexpectedly, little or no correlation was observed between the size of the glabrous forepaw compared to the size of the glabrous forepaw representation in the FBS for any of the treatment groups. The present findings of PAE-related alterations in sensory periphery and the central cortical representation may underlie deficits in sensorimotor integration reported among children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - Objective: This study investigated whether there were differential effects of substantial prenatal alcohol exposure on letter and category fluency in children. Given that children with prenatal alcohol exposure are often impaired in executive functioning and that letter fluency taxes executive processes more than category fluency, it was expected that children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) would be more impaired in letter than in category fluency. A second objective of the study was to examine the developmental trends in the two types of fluency in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. It was hypothesized that between the ages of 6 and 9 years, these FAS children would show age-related changes in category fluency but not in letter fluency. Method: As part of a neuropsychological test battery designed for an international collaborative study of FAS in South Africa, tests of letter and category fluency were administered in Afrikaans. The participants were 62 children with FAS and 61 controls matched with respect to age, gender (58 boys and 65 girls), ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results: Results showed that the FAS group had relatively greater difficulty with letter fluency than with category fluency and that the FAS group generated fewer words in both fluency conditions. Contrary to the expectation, however, alcohol-affected children demonstrated age-related linear trends in both letter and category fluency. Conclusions: This is the first study of verbal fluency involving a large sample of well-diagnosed children with FAS conducted in a nonwestern environment. The results are nonetheless consistent with those obtained in western countries in studies of children with various levels of prenatal alcohol exposure and various levels of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This study suggests that at least some aspects of the cognitive profile associated with prenatal alcohol exposure may be generalizable across cultural and ethnic boundaries.

N2  - In-utero alcohol exposure produces sensorimotor developmental abnormalities that often persist into adulthood. The rodent cortical barrel field associated with the representation of the body surface was used as our model system to examine the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on early somatosensory cortical development. In this study, pregnant female rats were intragastrically gavaged daily with high doses of alcohol (6 gm/kg body weight) throughout the first 20 days of pregnancy. Blood alcohol levels were measured in the pregnant dams on gestational days 13 (G13) and G20. The ethanol treated group (EtOH) was compared to the normal control chowfed (CF) group, nutritionally matched pairfed (PF) group, and cross-foster (XF) group. Cortical barrel development was examined in pups across all treatment groups from G25, corresponding to postnatal day 2 (P2), to G32 corresponding to P9. The EtOH and control group pups were weighed, anesthetized, and perfused. Brains were removed and weighed with, and without cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, and neocortex was removed and weighed. Cortices were then flattened, sectioned tangentially, and stained with a metabolic marker, cytochrome oxidase (CO) to reveal the barrel field. Progression of barrel development was distinguished into three categories: (a) absent, (b) cloudy barrel-like pattern, and (c) well-formed barrels with intervening septae. The major findings are: (1) PAE delayed barrel field development by one or more days, (2) the barrel field first appeared as a cloudy pattern that gave way on subsequent days to an adult-like pattern with clearly demarcated intervening septal regions, (3) the barrel field developed differentially in a lateral-to-medial gradient in both alcohol and control groups, (4) PAE delayed birth by one or more days in 53% of the pups, (5) regardless of whether pups were born on G23 (normal expected birth date for non-alcohol controls) or as in the case for the alcohol-delayed pups born as late as G27, the barrel field was never present at birth suggesting the importance of postnatal experience on barrel field development, and (6) PAE did not disrupt the normal barrel field pattern, although both total body and brain weights were compromised. These findings suggest that PAE delays the development of the somatosensory cortex (SI); such delays may interfere with timing and formation of cortical circuits. It is unknown whether other nuclei along the somatosensory pathway undergo similar delays in development or if PAE selectively disrupts cortical circuitry. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuropathologic and neuroimaging studies have shown a wide range of structural problems, including abnormal neuronal migration and volume reduction in specific brain regions, including white matter. We identified foci of significant fetal white matter microglia-macrophage immunoreactivity in a "binge" model of early prenatal alcohol exposure in sheep. Ewes of alcohol-exposed fetuses received daily 90 min alcohol (1.5 gm/kg i.v.) infusions at 30-60 d gestation (term = 147 d). Ewes of control fetuses received same volume infusions of normal saline intravenously. Near-term (125 d gestation) fetal brains were labeled with microglia-macrophages using HAM56 antibody. We quantified dense immunoreactive cellular regions across sections and anatomical locations using computer-assisted microscopy and quantitative morphometry. The proportional HAM56-positive area in cortical white matter was greater in the alcohol-exposed fetuses (1.6%) compared with the saline controls (0.7%). The areas were localized to the frontal gyral white matter, temporal gyral white matter, optic radiation, and others (corpus callosum, septum pellucidum, fasciculus subcallosus, and external capsule), with a greater distribution in the gyral white matter. The greater area of macrophage-rich regions in near-term fetal sheep brain suggests a vulnerability of developing white matter that is enhanced by early alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Disruptions in sleep and feeding rhythms are among the consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. Previously, we reported that ethanol exposure during the second trimester equivalent in rats produces long-lasting impairments in circadian system functioning. In the present study, we examined the effects of ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent brain growth spurt on the development of the circadian clock system. Methods: Sprague-Dawley male rat pups were exposed to 6.0 g/kg/d ethanol via an artificial rearing procedure on postnatal days (PD) 4 through 9 (EtOH). An artificially reared gastrostomized control group and a normally reared suckle control group were also included. At 10 to 12 weeks of age, wheel-running behavior was measured continuously under a 12-hour/12-hour light/dark (LD) cycle. Thereafter, subjects were exposed to a 6-hour phase delay of the LD cycle, and the ability to adjust to the new LD cycle was evaluated. Results: Before the phase delay, onset time of activity and acrophases of activity in all 3 groups were not significantly different from one another. After the 6-hour LD cycle delay, EtOH subjects were slower to adapt to the new cycle compared with both control groups, as measured by both activity onset and acrophase. Throughout the experiment, activity levels of EtOH subjects tended to be higher compared to both controls. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that ethanol exposure during the third trimester disrupts the ability to synchronize circadian rhythm to light cues. Disruptions in circadian regulation may cause abnormal behavioral rhythmicity, such as disrupted sleep and feeding patterns, as seen in individuals prenatally exposed to ethanol.

N2  - Motor coordination was assessed in two samples of adult subjects: one sample (n = 90) included adults previously diagnosed with one of a number of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and comparison peers, the second was a prospective longitudinal study of adults who were exposed to varying levels of alcohol as fetuses (n = 402). This comparative analysis sought to determine whether motor effects seen in both clinical and nonclinical children persist into adulthood, whether any individual motor tasks show significant effects of prenatal alcohol exposure across the age range, and whether motor assessments of adults have any role in diagnostic strategies for adults suspected of FASD. Motor tests included balance and unilateral, bilateral, finger, hand and foot coordination. Three-quarters of the subjects with FASD demonstrated deficits in motor function outside the range of comparison subjects. Adults with FASD performed more poorly, on average, on all individual tests including balance and fine motor control. In the prospective longitudinal sample, only subjects who had been previously identified in childhood as having a possible diagnosis on the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum were still in deficit as adults on motor tasks, relative to comparison subjects. Thus, the dose-dependent motor coordination effects of alcohol previously found in children do not appear to persist into adulthood, except in those most highly exposed children who also have other accompanying neuropsychological effects in childhood. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The brains of fetal alcohol syndrome patients exhibit impaired neuronal migration, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying this abnormality. Here we show that Ca2+ signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of alcohol action in neuronal cell migration. Acute administration of ethanol reduced the frequency of transient Ca2+ elevations in migrating neurons and cGMP levels and increased cAMP levels. Experimental manipulations of these second-messenger pathways, through stimulating Ca2+ and cGMP signaling or inhibiting cAMP signaling, completely reversed the action of ethanol on neuronal migration in vitro as well as in vivo. Each second messenger has multiple but distinct downstream targets, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, calcineurin, protein phosphatase 1, Rho GTPase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. These results demonstrate that the aberrant migration of immature neurons in the fetal brain caused by maternal alcohol consumption may be corrected by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways.

N2  - Objectives: To examine alcohol use for mothers with and without an ADH1B*3 allele and the moderating effects of the maternal and child ADH1B*3 allele on a broad range of infant and 7.5-year outcomes. Study design: Blood samples from 263 black mother/child pairs (217 mothers and 239 children) were analyzed to determine incidence of the ADH1B allele and the relation of the maternal allele to pregnancy drinking assessed at every prenatal clinic visit. Moderating effects of ADH1B were examined by dichotomizing the moderator variable and performing regression analyses on the 2 groups. Results: Pregnancy drinking at conception was less frequent in the presence of the ADH1B*3 allele, and virtually no adverse effects were found in children whose mothers had at least one ADH1B *3 allele. By contrast to the maternal allele, we found no consistent pattern of greater vulnerability in children lacking the ADH1B *3 allele. Conclusions: These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the maternal ADH1B*3 allele provides some protection to the fetus from prenatal alcohol exposure. Copyright © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying self-reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health professionals at the Maipu Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption, and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p = 0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age (p = 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile, clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Inc.

N2  - The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human comprise a spectrum of structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We previously have proposed revisions to the 1996 Institute of Medicine Diagnostic Criteria for diagnoses in the FASD continuum [fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)], allowing for more reproducible and accurate FASD diagnosis in a clinical setting [Hoyme et al, 2005]. The NIAAA recently has coordinated and funded an international consortium of projects aimed at more complete characterization of the teratogenic spectrum of alcohol. One of the projects sites is in Finland. The aims of this project are: (1) to completely clinically characterize the structural and learning/behavioral phenotypes of a large cohort of older children and adolescents with moderate to severe disability within the FASD continuum; (2) to correlate FASD dysmorphology and behavioral phenotypes with CNS structure and function (i.e., MRS, MRI correlations); (3) to compare the phenotype of a genetically homogeneous population of Finnish children with FASD to that observed in other populations. We have recently completed dysmorphology examination and parent/guardian interviews of the 77 children in the Finnish cohort. The purpose of this report is to present historical and morphometric data on these patients, thereby more completely delineating the clinical spectrum of FASD in older children and adolescents, contrasting the phenotype with that described in other populations and examining whether a weighted dysmorphology score could be used as a clinical and research adjunct when fetal alcohol exposure is being suspected. All children were previously diagnosed with FASD by an experienced pediatric specialist in Finland, and all were exposed to significant maternal alcohol abuse prenatally. The sex ratio of the cohort was 0.38 (male: female) and ages ranged from 8 to 20 years, with a mean of 13 years. After application of the Revised IOM Diagnostic Criteria, 53% of the subjects were diagnosed as having FAS, 30% PFAS, 12% ARND, and 5% other diagnoses. Of note, although a family history of mental retardation or birth defects was rare, 43% of the children had one or more sibling who also carried a diagnosis of FAS. Eighty-nine percent of the mothers smoked cigarettes during gestation; other teratogenic exposures were rare. Almost none had undergone genetics evaluation in the past. Almost all of the subjects had resided in multiple foster placements since early childhood and had been followed regularly by pediatric specialists. Although 11% were born prematurely, 70% demonstrated prenatal growth deficiency, and 45% were microcephalic. Other than growth deficits and the cardinal facial features, the most common major and minor anomalies noted were: camptodactyly (55%), "hockey stick" or other altered palmar creases (51%), refractive errors (40%), strabismus (38%), dental crowding (43%), nail hypoplasia (38%), GU anomalies (22%), and congenital heart defects (18%), "Railroad track" ears were not observed in this population. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with learning, behavioral, and academic problems even in children without the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Objective: To examine the prenatal alcohol exposure and ability, academic achievement, and school functioning in adolescence. Methods: In a longitudinal cohort, intelligence, academic performance, and school functioning were evaluated in 265 low socioeconomic status (SES) adolescents (M age = 15.1 years), 128 prenatally exposed to alcohol, 53 controls, and 84 special education students by using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd edition (WISC-III) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT). School records were abstracted for grade point averages (GPA), standardized achievement test scores, conduct, attendance, and special education placement. Results: Alcohol-affected youth had significantly lower IQs than those in the other three groups. Conclusion: Although academic achievement (WIAT scores) was most impaired in the special education group who showed lower performance over all as well as in reading and spelling, alcohol-affected youth showed significant deficits on mathematics subtests. There was no increased incidence of conduct problems in school records related to alcohol exposure. © The Author 2005.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Objective: This study examined the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and child depressive symptoms, and the mediating effects of maternal and child characteristics. Methods: Participants were 42 children aged 4-5 years and their biological mothers. Prenatal alcohol consumption was assessed by self-report of maximum drinks per drinking occasion. The Pictorial Depression Scale (PDS) measured child depressive symptoms. Mother-child interactions were assessed using the family interaction puzzle task. Results: Structural equation modeling indicated that prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with more negative child affect. In turn, mothers of more negative children were less emotionally connected to their children, and those children had higher levels of depressive symptomatology. Results could not be explained by current maternal drinking patterns or maternal depression. Conclusions: Study findings highlight the importance of examining prenatal alcohol exposure as a risk factor in the prediction of childhood-onset depression and the environmental mechanisms that may mediate that relationship. © The Author 2005.

N2  - Alcohol abuse in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranging from discreet developmental problems to fetal alcohol syndrome. That is why pregnant women and the women considering pregnancy should abstain from alcohol. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders occur even after drinking at early stages of pregnancy when women are not aware of being pregnant. According to one study 75% Czech women drank alcohol before pregnancy and one third of them continued during first three months of pregnancy. According to new epidemiological data 83.4% of Czech women aged between 18 and 40 drank alcohol during the year preceeding the pregnancy. The prevention in this area in the Czech Republic is clearly not satisfactory, and it is complicated by the alcohol advertising targeted at women, low taxation of alcohol and other factors.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Elevated levels of fatty acid ethyl esters have been documented in the meconium of neonates born to heavily drinking mothers. Recently, accumulation of FAEE has been documented in the hair of drinking adults. To be able to use this test in the diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, one needs to establish baseline FAEE levels in infants born to nonalcoholic women because ethanol occurs in the baby naturally even without drinking. Scalp hair of 56 infants born to nonalcoholic women attending a well-baby clinic was obtained. Levels of FAEE were measured by GC-MS. FAEE were detected in almost all hair samples. Offspring of women admitting to mild, infrequent drinking did not differ in FAEE hair levels from infants of total abstainers. Baseline levels of FAEE in neonatal hair of nonalcoholic mothers have been established. Mild infrequent maternal drinking does not elevate these baseline levels. This may help avoid false-positive determinations when assessing infants born to problem drinking mothers.

T1  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy
A1  - Krulewitch C.J.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Alcohol is a potent teratogen in humans, and prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) refers to a pattern of birth defects found in children of mothers who drank during pregnancy. FAS has four criteria: maternal drinking during pregnancy, a characteristic pattern of facial abnormalities, growth retardation, and brain damage (often manifested by intellectual difficulties or behavioral problems). As surveillance and research have progressed, it has become clear that FAS is but a rare example of a wide array of defects that can occur from exposure to alcohol in utero. At least 1 in 10 women will continue to consume alcohol during pregnancy, putting their fetuses at risk for the effects of alcohol exposure. Nurses are in a key position to provide care and conduct research that will contribute to the prevention of the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure during the preconception and perinatal periods, as well as deal with the negative outcomes of exposure in the developing infant. Many areas have yet to be evaluated. Screening tools and interventions have been developed and tested, mostly in majority cultures. Culturally sensitive instruments must be generated and validated for high-risk groups such as Native Americans. Fetal alcohol biomarkers and genetic research are new and need considerably more work. Effective "no drinking during pregnancy" campaigns for high-risk groups must be created and tested. Nurses are well placed to conduct research that will describe the effects at social, behavioral, and biological levels; develop middle-range theories targeted at preventing the drinking behavior and optimizing care of affected children after birth; and generate and test effective interventions that enhance prevention strategies in the 21st century.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Since 1986, American parents have adopted >17300 children from Guatemala. This study assessed the health, growth, and developmental status of 103 Guatemalan adopted children (48 girls; 55 boys) after arrival in the United States. Physical evidence suggestive of prenatal alcohol exposure and adequacy of vaccinations administered were also reviewed. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted of 103 children who were evaluated after arrival in the United States in an international adoption specialty clinic, and a case-matched study was conducted of a subgroup of 50 children who resided in either an orphanage or foster care before adoption. Mean age at arrival was 16 +/- 19 months. Before adoption, 25 children resided in orphanages, 56 resided in foster care, and 22 resided in mixed-care settings. The 25 children who had resided in orphanages before adoption were matched for age at arrival, interval from arrival to clinic visit, and gender with a child adopted from foster care. Health and developmental status of these matched pairs were compared, allowing the first direct comparison of children raised in orphanages or foster care before adoption. RESULTS: Mild growth delays were frequent among the children. Mean z scores for weight, height, and head circumference were, respectively, -1.00, -1.04, and -1.08. Children from foster care had significantly better z scores for height, weight, and head circumference than those from orphanage or mixed care. Among children who were younger than 2 years at arrival, growth measurements correlated inversely with age at arrival. Infectious diseases included intestinal parasites (8%) and latent tuberculosis infection (7%). Other medical conditions included anemia (30%), elevated lead levels (3%), and (using strict criteria) phenotypic facial features suggestive of prenatal alcohol exposure (28%). Adequacy of vaccine records from Guatemala was assessed: 28% met American Academy of Pediatrics standards for vaccine administration. Unsuspected significant medical diagnoses, including congenital anomalies and ocular, neurologic, and orthopedic problems, were found in 14%. Most children were doing well developmentally (80-92% of expected performance), but 14% had global developmental delays. Cognition, expressive and receptive language, and activities of daily living skills correlated inversely with age at arrival for children who were younger than 2 years at adoption. Among the 50 matched children, those who resided in foster care before adoption had better measurements for height, weight, and head circumference at arrival to the United States. Moreover, those who resided in foster care scored significantly better for cognitive skills than those who had previously resided in orphanages (96.3% of age-expected compared with 88.3% of age-expected); other skills did not differ between the 2 groups. No differences were found between the 2 groups of children related to prevalence of medical diagnoses or phenotypic evidence suggesting prenatal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Guatemalan adoptees display similar overall patterns of growth and developmental delays as seen in other groups of internationally adopted children, although not as severe. Younger children had better growth and development (cognition, language, and activities of daily living skills) than older children, regardless of location of residence before adoption. Among children who were matched for age, gender, and interval from adoption to evaluation, those who had resided in foster care had better growth and cognitive scores than children who had resided in orphanages before adoption. These findings support the need for timely adoptive placement of young infants and support the placement of children in attentive foster care rather than orphanages when feasible.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) results from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and carries lifelong consequences. Early recognition of FAS can result in better outcomes for persons who receive a diagnosis. Although FAS was first identified in 1973, persons with this condition often do not receive a diagnosis. In 2002, Congress directed CDC to update and refine diagnostic and referral criteria for FAS, incorporating recent scientific and clinical evidence. In 2002, CDC convened a scientific working group (SWG) of persons with expertise in FAS research, diagnosis, and treatment to draft criteria for diagnosing FAS. This report summarizes the diagnostic guidelines drafted by the SWG, provides recommendations for when and how to refer a person suspected of having problems related to prenatal alcohol exposure, and assesses existing practices for creating supportive environments that might prevent long-term adverse consequences associated with FAS. The guidelines were created on the basis of a review of scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and the experiences of families affected by FAS regarding the physical and neuropsychologic features of FAS and the medical, educational, and social services needed by persons with FAS and their families. The guidelines are intended to facilitate early identification of persons affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol so they and their families can receive services that enable them to achieve healthy lives and reach their full potential. This report also includes recommendations to enhance identification of and intervention for women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Additional data are needed to develop diagnostic criteria for other related disorders (e.g., alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder).

N2  - QUESTION: By the time women find out they are pregnant and see a family physician, they might have already consumed alcohol during the pregnancy and affected the development of their fetuses. How can family physicians better prevent exposure to alcohol during pregnancy? ANSWER: Women of childbearing age should be counseled about the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy before they become pregnant. Diagnosing children who have fetal alcohol spectrum disorders can help identify birth mothers who are at risk of other alcohol-exposed pregnancies and who need support to change their behaviour.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to examine fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among Japanese children of alcoholic mothers. This is the first report concerning FASD in Japan. METHODS: The subjects were 30 alcoholic women who were inpatients in the Kurihama Alcoholism Center and had given birth to children. They were subjected to a semi-structured interview by the author. Sixty healthy women who had not drunk during pregnancy were used as a control group, and they also underwent semi-structured interviews. The alcoholic women were divided into two groups, 13 who drunk during pregnancies and 17 who did not drink. Twenty children experienced of prenatal alcohol exposure and 40 children did not. The three groups; i.e., 13 alcoholic mothers who had drunk during pregnancy and their 20 children (ALD group), 17 alcoholic mothers who had not drunk during pregnancy and their 40 children (ALND group) and 60 non-alcoholic control mothers and their 80 children (Control group), were compared concerning the mothers' drinking problems and abnormal deliveries, children's birth weights, congenital abnormalities, abnormalities of the central nervous system and psychological problems. RESULTS: The mean age of onset of problem drinking of the mothers in the ALD group was significantly lower than that in the mothers of the ALND group, and some of the mothers in the ALD group showed alcohol dependence before their pregnancies. The mean birth weights of the children of the ALD group, ALND group and Control group were 2816 g, 3128 g and 3142 g, respectively and the differences were significant. The children of the ALD group had significantly more abnormal birth episodes, developmental retardation and psychiatric symptoms than those in the other two groups. Among 20 children in the ALD group, FASD was suspected in 6 children (10% of the children of alcoholic mothers). Six children had low birth weights, abnormal birth episodes, mental retardation and psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: One third of the Japanese children of alcoholic mothers had experiences of prenatal alcohol exposure and 10% of them had suspected FASD abnormalities.

T1  - The neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Welch-Carre E.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - During pregnancy, ingestion of alcohol, a known teratogen, can cause harm to the fetus. Prenatal alcohol exposure is one of the leading causes of birth defects, developmental disorders, and mental retardation in children. The fetal central nervous system is particularly vulnerable to alcohol; this vulnerability contributes to many of the long-term disabilities and disorders seen in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure. Diagnoses associated with prenatal alcohol exposure include fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and alcohol-related birth defects. Once diagnosed, early intervention improves the long-term outcome of affected children. Without documentation of maternal alcohol use, a diagnosis, and consequently treatment, is often difficult to attain. It is imperative that nurses, physicians, and other healthcare providers become comfortable with obtaining a history of, and providing anticipatory guidance and counseling about, alcohol use.

N2  - PURPOSE: The incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is increasing, even though it is 100% preventable. This study examined use of, knowledge about, and attitudes toward alcohol of women requesting emergency contraception (EC) and/or a pregnancy test, and evaluated whether a brief intervention would be effective in educating them about the risks of FASD. DATA SOURCES: Fifty women from two outpatient clinics participated. Information was collected on demographic and personal health habits, alcohol use, and knowledge of and attitudes toward alcohol. As a brief intervention to increase knowledge about FASD, participants read a short pamphlet about the risks of alcohol exposure in pregnancy and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and skewness, were calculated for all variables. Pearson correlations were computed to assess relationships between demographic/lifestyle variables and attitudes toward and knowledge about alcohol. Paired t-tests were used to analyze the relationship between pretest and post-test knowledge scores. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants were single (76%), college educated (94%), and received EC at the clinic visit (60%). The average age was 24 years. Slightly over half (52%) reported drinking beer at least once a week, with one to six cans on occasion. Younger women expressed more tolerant attitudes toward alcohol use (p= .02) and drank significantly more beer on occasion (p= .015). Women who reported drinking alcohol when they last had sex were significantly (p= .017) less tolerant in their attitudes toward alcohol use. The intervention used in this study was effective in communicating knowledge about FASD to this population (p < .0001). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings suggest that young women may be engaging in behaviors that could put potential offspring at risk for exposure to alcohol. Clinicians are advised to take a thorough history to determine alcohol use in all women of childbearing age and to provide information regarding FASD prevention.

N2  - Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy may result in facial dysmorphism, growth retardation and central nervous system deficits. This has been found in infants ranging from fetal alcohol effects (FAE) to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), or alcohol related neurodevelopment disorders (ARND) and alcohol related birth defects (ARBD). In this study, we report a FAE case with orofacial cleft due to mother's alcohol use during her pregnancy. A 32-year-old Japanese woman, para2, gravida3. She was drinking alcohol while this pregnancy. At 39th week, a girl was delivered vaginally. Her birth weight is 3860gr. Apgar score is seven points at one minutes and eight points at 10 minutes. Orofacial cleft and sinus tachycardia were diagnosed postnatally. From a brain-computed tomography (CTscan), it showed a normal finding. Karyotype was normal female phenotype (46, XX). It is important to note that the obstetrician had to advise the women not to have alcohol use during pregnancy in order to prevent her baby from fetal alcohol effects or toxic effect of alcohol on the fetus.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The first descriptions in the modern medical literature of a distinctly recognizable pattern of malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse were reported in 1968 and 1973. Since that time, substantial progress has been made in developing specific criteria for defining and diagnosing this condition. Two sets of diagnostic criteria are now used most widely for evaluation of children with potential diagnoses in the FASD continuum, ie, the 1996 Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria and the Washington criteria. Although both approaches have improved the clinical delineation of FASD, both suffer from significant drawbacks in their practical application in pediatric practice. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to present specific clarifications of the 1996 IOM criteria for the diagnosis of FASD, to facilitate their practical application in clinical pediatric practice. METHODS: A large cohort of children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol were identified, through active case-ascertainment methods, in 6 Native American communities in the United States and 1 community in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The children and their families underwent standardized multidisciplinary evaluations, including a dysmorphology examination, developmental and neuropsychologic testing, and a structured maternal interview, which gathered data about prenatal drinking practices and other demographic and family information. Data for these subjects were analyzed, and revisions and clarifications of the existing IOM FASD diagnostic categories were formulated on the basis of the results. RESULTS: The revised IOM method defined accurately and completely the spectrum of disabilities among the children in our study. On the basis of this experience, we propose specific diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome and partial fetal alcohol syndrome. We also define alcohol-related birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder from a practical standpoint. CONCLUSIONS: The 1996 IOM criteria remain the most appropriate diagnostic approach for children prenatally exposed to alcohol. The proposed revisions presented here make these criteria applicable in clinical pediatric practice.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Elevated levels of fatty acid ethyl esters have been documented in the meconium of neonates born to heavily drinking mothers. Recently, accumulation of FAEE has been documented in the hair of drinking adults. To be able to use this test in the diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, one needs to establish baseline FAEE levels in infants born to nonalcoholic women because ethanol occurs in the baby naturally even without drinking. Scalp hair of 56 infants born to nonalcoholic women attending a well-baby clinic was obtained. Levels of FAEE were measured by GC-MS. FAEE were detected in almost all hair samples. Offspring of women admitting to mild, infrequent drinking did not differ in FAEE hair levels from infants of total abstainers. Baseline levels of FAEE in neonatal hair of nonalcoholic mothers have been established. Mild infrequent maternal drinking does not elevate these baseline levels. This may help avoid false-positive determinations when assessing infants born to problem drinking mothers. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Objective. Since 1986, American parents have adopted >17 300 children from Guatemala. This study assessed the health, growth, and developmental status of 103 Guatemalan adopted children (48 girls; 55 boys) after arrival in the United States. Physical evidence suggestive of prenatal alcohol exposure and adequacy of vaccinations administered were also reviewed. Methods. Retrospective chart review was conducted of 103 children who were evaluated after arrival in the United States in an international adoption specialty clinic, and a case-matched study was conducted of a subgroup of 50 children who resided in either an orphanage or foster care before adoption. Mean age at arrival was 16 +/- 19 months. Before adoption, 25 children resided in orphanages, 56 resided in foster care, and 22 resided in mixed-care settings. The 25 children who had resided in orphanages before adoption were matched for age at arrival, interval from arrival to clinic visit, and gender with a child adopted from foster care. Health and developmental status of these matched pairs were compared, allowing the first direct comparison of children raised in orphanages or foster care before adoption. Results. Mild growth delays were frequent among the children. Mean z scores for weight, height, and head circumference were, respectively, -1.00, -1.04, and -1.08. Children from foster care had significantly better z scores for height, weight, and head circumference than those from orphanage or mixed care. Among children who were younger than 2 years at arrival, growth measurements correlated inversely with age at arrival. Infectious diseases included intestinal parasites (8%) and latent tuberculosis infection (7%). Other medical conditions included anemia (30%), elevated lead levels (3%), and (using strict criteria) phenotypic facial features suggestive of prenatal alcohol exposure (28%). Adequacy of vaccine records from Guatemala was assessed: 28% met American Academy of Pediatrics standards for vaccine administration. Unsuspected significant medical diagnoses, including congenital anomalies and ocular, neurologic, and orthopedic problems, were found in 14%. Most children were doing well developmentally (80-92% of expected performance), but 14% had global developmental delays. Cognition, expressive and receptive language, and activities of daily living skills correlated inversely with age at arrival for children who were younger than 2 years at adoption. Among the 50 matched children, those who resided in foster care before adoption had better measurements for height, weight, and head circumference at arrival to the United States. Moreover, those who resided in foster care scored significantly better for cognitive skills than those who had previously resided in orphanages (96.3% of age-expected compared with 88.3% of age-expected); other skills did not differ between the 2 groups. No differences were found between the 2 groups of children related to prevalence of medical diagnoses or phenotypic evidence suggesting prenatal alcohol exposure. Conclusions. Guatemalan adoptees display similar overall patterns of growth and developmental delays as seen in other groups of internationally adopted children, although not as severe. Younger children had better growth and development (cognition, language, and activities of daily living skills) than older children, regardless of location of residence before adoption. Among children who were matched for age, gender, and interval from adoption to evaluation, those who had resided in foster care had better growth and cognitive scores than children who had resided in orphanages before adoption. These findings support the need for timely adoptive placement of young infants and support the placement of children in attentive foster care rather than orphanages when feasible.

N2  - In rats, neonatal alcohol (EtOH) exposure coinciding with the period of rapid brain growth produces structural damage in some brain regions that often persists into adulthood and thus may have long-term consequences in the neural regulation of behavior. Because recent findings indicate that the circadian clock located in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus is vulnerable to alcohol-induced insults during development, the present study examined the long-term effects of neonatal alcohol exposure on the photic regulation of circadian behavior in adult rats. Rat pups were exposed to alcohol (3.0, 4.5, or 6.0 gkg-1day-1) or isocaloric milk formula on postnatal days 4-9 using artificial-rearing methods. At 2 months of age, animals were housed individually and circadian wheel-running behavior was continuously analyzed to determine the effects of neonatal alcohol treatment on the rate of reentrainment to a 6-h advance in the 12-h light:12-h dark photoperiod and the phase-shifting properties of free-running rhythms in response to discrete light pulses on a background of constant darkness. For all doses, neonatal alcohol exposure had a significant effect in reducing the time for reentrainment such that EtOH-treated rats required four to five fewer days than control animals for stable realignment of the activity rhythm to the shifted light-dark cycle. Coupled with the accelerated rate of reentrainment, the amplitude of light-evoked phase delays at circadian time 14 and advances at circadian time 22 in the 4.5 and 6.0 gkg-1day-1 EtOH groups was almost twofold greater than that observed in control animals. The present observations indicate that the mechanisms by which photic signals regulate circadian behavior are permanently altered following alcohol exposure during the period of rapid brain development. These long-term alterations in the photic regulation of circadian rhythms may account, at least partially, for some neurobehavioral consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure in humans such as depression. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Alcohol abuse is common among the population and results in significant diseases that shorten life span. Ethanol may result in chronic brain changes such as atrophy but may also result in neurologic disease that may be acute or chronic and sometimes life threatening. Accompanying vitamin deficiencies may lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy and changes in serum osmosis may lead to several acute demyelinating disorders. In addition, pregnant women who consume alcohol place their babies at high risk for the fetal alcohol syndrome. In this article we review these disorders and emphasize their imaging features.

N2  - Objectives. Evaluation of the prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure in relation with declared alcohol consumption (DAC). Materials and methods. Observational prospective study based on the DAC of 150 women in post-partum or hospitalized for abnormal pregnancies. The main selection criterion was change in DAC before and during pregnancy, classified according to alcohol use and misuse limits. Excessive alcohol intake was defined as more than 4 glasses on occasion and/or more than 14 glasses a week. Age and professional position were also taken into account. Data were obtained using semi-directive interviews. Results. 79% of these women drank before pregnancy. 33.2% of them had excessive intake. Consumption of more than 14 glasses a week concerned 10% of the population. Excessive consumptions on occasion significantly affected 33% of the population. During pregnancy, 43% of these women continued drinking. Overall excessive intake, which is noxious for children, concerned 9.9% of the women. 5% declared a regular misuse above 14 glasses a week and 7% of them consumed more than 4 glasses on occasion. The average age was 29.8 years. Most of the women (61%) had a stable job. Conclusion. Our study confirms alcohol consumption by women, even during pregnancy. Consumptions of pregnant women is decreasing progressively. DAC is very useful to evaluate alcohol intake. © Masson, 2005.

N2  - Background. The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The first descriptions in the modern medical literature of a distinctly recognizable pattern of malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse were reported in 1968 and 1973. Since that time, substantial progress has been made in developing specific criteria for defining and diagnosing this condition. Two sets of diagnostic criteria are now used most widely for evaluation of children with potential diagnoses in the FASD continuum, ie, the 1996 Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria and the Washington criteria. Although both approaches have improved the clinical delineation of FASD, both suffer from significant drawbacks in their practical application in pediatric practice. Objective. The purpose of this report is to present specific clarifications of the 1996 IOM criteria for the diagnosis of FASD, to facilitate their practical application in clinical pediatric practice. Methods. A large cohort of children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol were identified, through active case-ascertainment methods, in 6 Native American communities in the United States and 1 community in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The children and their families underwent standardized multidisciplinary evaluations, including a dysmorphology examination, developmental and neuropsychologic testing, and a structured maternal interview, which gathered data about prenatal drinking practices and other demographic and family information. Data for these subjects were analyzed, and revisions and clarifications of the existing IOM FASD diagnostic categories were formulated on the basis of the results. Results. The revised IOM method defined accurately and completely the spectrum of disabilities among the children in our study. On the basis of this experience, we propose specific diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome and partial fetal alcohol syndrome. We also define alcohol-related birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder from a practical standpoint. Conclusions. The 1996 IOM criteria remain the most appropriate diagnostic approach for children prenatally exposed to alcohol. The proposed revisions presented here make these criteria applicable in clinical pediatricpractice. Copyright © 2005 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - Brain damage consequent to prenatal alcohol exposure can be detected by measurements of the corpus callosum in the midline magnetic resonance (MR) brain image in adolescents and adults. The present article extends this finding into the neonatal period, when the power of detection to ameliorate the quality of the child's future life is greatest. The midline corpus callosum of the very young infant can be located reliably in multiple frames of clinical transfontanelle ultrasound. We studied a sample of 18 children aged 17 weeks or less, 7 of whom were exposed to high levels of alcohol prenatally and 11 of whom were not exposed or only minimally exposed. The midline callosum of each child was imaged up to 50 times by a standard clinical device, and coplanar subsets of these series were averaged with reference to fiducial image structures. On each average image four semilandmark points were set and their configuration quantified by standard landmark methods. The angle between the terminal bulb of splenium and the long axis of the callosal outline classifies four of the seven exposed infants as different from all 11 of the unexposed infants. This simple angle measurement upon averaged ultrasound images of the human neonatal midline corpus callosum, perhaps a version of the long-sought "biomarker of prenatal alcohol damage," may be able to discriminate baby brains affected by prenatal alcohol exposure from those that were unaffected. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Due to changing cultural norms, Latinas of childbearing age residing in the U.S. may be at increasing risk of drinking harmful levels of alcohol during pregnancy, and may also be unaware of the risks for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders associated with this behavior. We assessed the prevalence of alcohol consumption in a sample of low-income pregnant Latinas and examined risk factors for alcohol use in the periconceptional period. Methods: As part of a larger intervention trial, a cross-sectional in-home interview study was conducted among a sample of 100 pregnant low-income Latinas receiving services from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in San Diego County, California. Results: Fifty-seven percent of respondents indicated they were either life-time abstainers or had not consumed any alcohol in the periconceptional period. Forty-three percent reported some alcohol use in the three months prior to recognition of the current pregnancy, and 20% reported at least one binge episode of four or more standard drinks during that time frame. Five percent reported drinking seven or more drinks per week, and 8% continued drinking alcohol after recognition of pregnancy. Significant predictors of any alcohol use in the periconceptional period included English language/higher level of acculturation, younger maternal age, lower parity, higher level of education, younger age at first drink, and having ever smoked. Women who were aware of alcohol warning messages and /or had more knowledge of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) were significantly more likely to have consumed alcohol in the periconceptional period. Frequency of periconceptional use of alcohol did not differ between women who planned or did not plan the pregnancy. Conclusion: The prevalence and pattern of early pregnancy alcohol consumption in this sample of Latinas is similar to patterns noted in other race/ethnic groups in the U.S. Level of knowledge about FAS and awareness of warning messages was not protective for early pregnancy alcohol consumption, suggesting that specific knowledge was insufficient to prevent exposure or that other factors reinforce maintenance of alcohol consumption in early pregnancy. Selective interventions in low-income Latinas are warranted, and should be focused on women of reproductive age who are binge or frequent drinkers and who are at risk of becoming pregnant.

N2  - Alcohol drinking during pregnancy results in abnormal fetal development, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in humans and experimental animals. FAS is characterized by two major effects, including central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and multiple anomalies recognizable mainly as a typical face. However, the mechanisms of alcohol-induced embryotoxicity have not been clearly demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced FAS in the developing embryo. First, ethanol-induced developmental abnormalities were investigated in vitro. Postimplantation embryos at gestation day (GD) 9.5 were cultured for 48 h and observed for morphological changes. Ethanol-mediated changes in proteins regulated apoptosis (p53 and bcl-2), antioxidant (vitamin E and catalase) activities, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative DNA damage shown as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-O HdG) were measured in embryonic midbrain cells. Alcohol or acetaldehyde significantly induced cytotoxicity in cultured rat embryonic midbrain cells. The levels of p53, bcl-2, and 8-O HdG were concomitantly changed by alcohol and acetaldehyde treatment in midbrain cells. Injured cells induced by ROS were increased by alcohol or acetaldehyde treatment in midbrain cells. Cotreatment with alcohol or acetaldehyde and catalase decreased cytotoxicity in midbrain cells. In postimplantation embryo culture, alcohol or acetaldehyde-treated embryos showed retardation of embryonic growth and development in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that alcohol and its metabolite acetaldehyde induce fetal developmental abnormalities by disrupting cellular differentiation and growth. Data demonstrate that some antioxidants can partially protect against the alcohol-induced embryonic developmental toxicity. Copyright© Taylor & Francis Inc.

A cross-sectional analysis of alcohol consumption and hormone levels in 339 pregnant women sampled from the Child Health and Development Study cohort was undertaken. Alcohol intake was queried from 1959 to 1966, long before any hazards of drinking during pregnancy were publicized. Third trimester serum hormone levels including estradiol and testosterone were analyzed. Among 339 pregnant women, 196 reported some alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The drinkers were divided into three groups with intake levels of 0.2-0.5, 0.6-2.0, and 2.1-12.5 ounces of ethanol per week. The second group corresponds to a median intake of ~2 drinks per week, and the last group corresponds to a median intake of ~1 drink per day, which is considered "light" to "moderate" drinking. Maternal estradiol levels were not associated with alcohol intake during pregnancy. However, serum testosterone was significantly lower, by 12.2%, in the latter two groups of drinking pregnant women, [confidence interval (CI) = -3.0 to 25.2] and 25.6% (CI = 9.2-39.5), respectively. The alcohol intakes reported are far below those shown to cause fetal alcohol syndrome, or any of the fetal alcohol effects so far studied. Light alcohol intake during pregnancy is associated with lower maternal testosterone. The health implications are uncertain, but may include an increased breast density in the daughters of drinking mothers. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Alcohol use among women of childbearing age is prevalent in the United States, with approximately 1 in 5 non-pregnant women reporting binge drinking (5 or more drinks on any one occasion) and 1 in 25 pregnant women reporting binge drinking. Alcohol use during pregnancy results in a spectrum of adverse outcomes known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of these disorders. Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by specific facial abnormalities and significant impairments in neurodevelopment and physical growth. Early identification of children with FAS has been shown to enhance their long-term outcomes. In an effort to improve clinical recognition of children with this condition, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was directed by Congress in 2002 to lead the development of uniform diagnostic criteria for FAS and other prenatal alcohol-related conditions. The purpose of this commentary is to provide clinicians a summary of the report released by CDC describing the current diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, advancements have been made in screening and brief interventions for alcohol use disorders in women who have the potential to make significant strides in the prevention of FAS spectrum disorders. Knowledge of the diagnostic criteria for FAS can lead to increased identification of the syndrome in infants and children and the provision of appropriate medical and support services. Screening for and intervening with women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy can prevent FAS and other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2005 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Children prenatally exposed to alcohol typically exhibit behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity, learning deficits, and an increased prevalence of depression. Similar impairments are found in children of hypothyroid mothers, and we have shown that alcohol-consuming rat dams have suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) function. Therefore, we hypothesized that suppressed maternal thyroid hormonal milieu may contribute to the deleterious consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. We aimed first to confirm and then to reverse the behavioral deficits in the fetal alcohol exposed (FAE) rat offspring by administration of thyroxine (T4) to the alcohol-consuming dams. Adult offspring prenatally exposed to ethanol (FAE; 35% ethanol-derived calories), pair-fed (PF) or control (C) diets were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM), the forced swim test (FST), and the open field test (OFT) to assess spatial learning, depressive behavior, and exploratory behavior/anxiety, respectively. Adult FAE offspring took longer to locate a hidden platform in the MWM and showed increased depressive behavior in the FST both of which were reversed by administration of T4 to the alcohol-consuming mother. We found sex and brain region-specific alterations in expression of genes involved in these behaviors in FAE adult offspring. Specifically, decreased hippocampal GAP-43 mRNA levels in adult FAE females and decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the amygdala of male and female FAE offspring were observed. The decreased mRNA levels of GAP-43 and GR were normalized by T4 treatment to the alcohol-consuming mother. Our results suggest that the suppressed HPT function of the alcohol-consuming mother contributes to the behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions observed in the offspring. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

N2  - Alcohol abuse in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranging from discreet developmental problems to fetal alcohol syndrome. That is why pregnant women and the women considering pregnancy should abstain from alcohol. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders occur even after drinking at early stages of pregnancy when women are not aware of being pregnant. According to one study 75% Czech women drank alcohol before pregnancy and one third of them continued during first three months of pregnancy. According to new epidemiological data 83,4 % of Czech women aged between 18 and 40 drank alcohol during the year preceeding the pregnancy. The prevention in this area in the Czech Republic is clearly not satisfactory, and it is complicated by the alcohol advertising targeted at women, low taxation of alcohol and other factors.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a second primary school cohort in a community in South Africa. Method: Active case ascertainment, two-tier screening, and Institute of Medicine assessment methodology were employed among 857 first grade pupils, most born in 1993. Characteristics of children with FAS were contrasted with characteristics of a randomly selected control group from the same classrooms. Physical growth and development, dysmorphology and psychological characteristics of the children and measures of maternal alcohol use and smoking were analyzed. Results: The rate of FAS found in this study is the highest yet reported in any overall community in the world, 65.2-74.2 per 1,000 children in the first grade population. These rates are 33-148 times greater than U.S. estimates and higher than in a previous cohort study in this same community (40.5-46.4 per 1,000). Detailed documentation of physical features indicates that FAS children in South Africa have characteristics similar to those elsewhere: poor growth and development, facial and limb dysmorphology, and lower intellectual functioning. Frequent, severe episodic drinking of beer and wine is common among mothers and fathers of FAS children. Their lives are characterized by serious familial, social and economic challenges, compared with controls. Heavy episodic maternal drinking is significantly associated with negative outcomes of children in the area of non-verbal intelligence but even more so in verbal intelligence, behavior and overall dysmorphology (physical anomalies). Significantly more FAS exists among children of women who were rural residents (odds ratio: 7.36, 95% confidence interval: 3.31-16.52), usually among workers on local farms. Conclusion: A high rate of FAS was documented in this community. Given social and economic similarities and racial admixture, we suspect that other communities in the Western Cape have rates that also are quite high.

N2  - Background: Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure can cause impairments even in the absence of gross morphological defects associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. The basal ganglia, which include the dopamine-rich striatum, are sensitive to fetal alcohol-induced injury. In this study, we manipulated the timing of moderate-level alcohol exposure and compared the risk of adverse effects on striatal dopamine (DA) system function in rhesus monkeys. Methods: Thirty-five young adult rhesus monkeys (Macaco mulatta) from four groups of females were assessed: (1) an early alcohol-exposed group (n = 9), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6 g/kg alcohol solution on gestational days O through 50; (2) a middle-to-late gestation alcohol-exposed group (n = 7), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6 g/kg alcohol solution on gestational days 50 through 135; (3) a continuous-exposure group (n = 9), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6 g/kg alcohol solution on days O through 135; and (4) controls (n = 10), in which mothers voluntarily consumed an isocaloric control solution on gestational days O through 50,50 through 135, or 0 through 135. We studied striatal DA system function by positron emission tomography in separate scans for trapping of [18F]fallypride and 6-[18F]fluoro-m- tyrosine to assess striatal DA D2 receptor (D2R) binding and DA synthesis, respectively, via dopadecarboxylase activity. Results: Moderate-level alcohol exposure during early gestation and continuous exposure throughout gestation (early + middle-to-late exposure) reduced the striatal D2R binding to DA synthesis ratio, whereas middle-to-late alcohol gestation exposure increased the striatal D2R binding to DA synthesis ratio. The continuous-exposure group showed the largest effect. Moreover, the D2R binding/DA synthesis ratio was related to neonatal neurobehavior measures in control monkeys, but these relationships were disrupted in the fetal alcohol-exposed monkeys. Conclusion: These results suggest that the vulnerability of the DA system to the effects of moderate doses of alcohol during gestation depend on the timing of the alcohol exposure. Early-gestation moderate alcohol exposure resulted in a reduction or blunting of dopaminergic function in adulthood, whereas middle to late exposure (without early exposure) either induced the opposite pattern or heightened dopaminergic function. Continuously exposed monkeys showed the largest effect, suggesting that the sooner women stop drinking, the better it is for the fetus. Copyright © 2005 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objective: Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders are contributors to long-term learning disabilities. By using a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, we have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure results in adult learning deficits of unknown mechanisms. In the developing hippocampus, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2B triggers long-term potentiation, fundamental to learning and memory; this is supplemented by the less plastic NR2A subunit in the adult. To understand the mechanism of learning deficits in FAS, we evaluated NR2B and NR2A expression in embryonic and adult mice. Study design: Pregnant C57Bl6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol or control (saline solution). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 10 days, and brains from adult offspring were collected at 3 months (after evaluation for learning deficit). Calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for NR2B and NR2A with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance. Results: At 6 hours, NR2B expression in the alcohol-exposed embryos was higher than in controls (P < .01). NR2A was not expressed in either group. By 24 hours there was no difference in NR2B (P = .3). However, at 10 days NR2B was lower in alcohol-exposed animals (P = .02). In the adult brains there was a relative decrease in NR2B (P = .03) and an increase in NR2A (P < .01). Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure during development induces NR2B expression deregulation in the embryos that persists until adulthood, when a relative increase in the less modifiable subunit NR2A occurs. This alteration in NMDA receptor subunits may underlie the learning abnormalities in fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - A significant number of college women are at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) owing to binge drinking paired with using contraception ineffectively. This article describes a randomized controlled trial of a one-session motivational interviewing-based intervention to reduce AEP risk among college women and presents 1-month outcomes demonstrating the early impact of this intervention. There were 228 female students from a mid-Atlantic urban university enrolled in the trial. Eligibility criteria were being in the age range of 18-24 years and being at risk for AEP. Risk for AEP was defined as having sexual intercourse with a man in the past 90 days while using contraception ineffectively (no use, incorrect use of an effective method, or use of an ineffective method only); drinking at risky levels was defined as engaging in at least one binge in the past 90 days or consuming an average of eight standard drinks per week. One-month outcome data were available for 212 of the 228 enrolled women (a follow-up rate of 93%), with complete data available for 105 women assigned to the control condition and 94 assigned to the intervention condition. At 1-month follow-up, 15% of the control subjects and 25% of the intervention women reported no risk drinking, a significant difference favoring the intervention group. Significantly fewer control subjects (48%) used effective contraception at 1-month follow-up as compared with intervention women (64%), chi2(1) = 5.1, p < .03. Significantly more intervention women (74%) were no longer at risk for AEP at 1 month as compared with control subjects (54%), chi2(1) = 8.15, p < .005. Factors that were associated with continued AEP risk at 1-month follow-up were a higher number of standard drinks per day consumed in the month prior to baseline (odds ratio, 1.1) and assignment to the control condition (odds ratio, 2.9). The risks of unintended pregnancy and AEP among drinking women in college merit greater prevention efforts. The results of this study show the promise of one preventive intervention that warrants additional study. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Question: By the time women find out they are pregnant and see a family physician, they might have already consumed alcohol during the pregnancy and affected the development of their fetuses. How can family physicians better prevent exposure to alcohol during pregnancy? Answer: Women of childbearing age should be counseled about the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy before they become pregnant. Diagnosing children who have fetal alcohol spectrum disorders can help identify birth mothers who are at risk of other alcohol-exposed pregnancies and who need support to change their behaviour.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure results in fetal death and neurobehavioral complications including learning impairment. Previously synthetic peptides derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor have been shown to prevent aspects of alcohol-induced damage in pregnancy. The objective of this work was to evaluate whether activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 could prevent alcohol-induced damage in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Study design: Using a well-characterized model, C57Bl6/J mice on gestational day 8 were treated with placebo, alcohol (30% volume/volume alcohol 0.03 mL/kg), alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 30 minutes prior to alcohol, or activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 alone. Fetal death was assessed on gestational day 18 (25 litters were evaluated: alcohol, n = 5; placebo, n = 9; alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12, n = 11). Neonatal behavior tests were performed on postnatal days 1 through 21 with the offspring of 12 dams (alcohol, n = 16; placebo, n = 46; alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12, n = 23; and activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12, n = 35). Adult males were tested in the Morris water maze for learning assessment and with the hole punch activity test for exploratory activity. Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis and analysis of variance. Results: Fetal death was greater in alcohol (67% +/- 13%) vs placebo (8.4% +/- 3%, P<.001). Pretreatment with activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death (2.2% +/- 8.1%) with levels similar to control (P = .12). Alcohol exposure caused a delay in achieving developmental milestones, with alcohol achieving milestones later than all other groups (all P<.001). Pretreatment with activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 prevented the alcohol-induced milestone delays. In the Morris water maze, the placebo learned, decreasing their latency to find the hidden platform over 70% (P<.01). Alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 also significantly learned, with a learning curve not different from placebo (all P>.5) and significantly better than alcohol on days 4, 6, and 7 (all P<.05). Alcohol exposure resulted in significantly less time in hole punch activity (P<.02) than control. Activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 pretreatment prevented the alcohol-induced decline, with levels the same as control (P = .1). Conclusion: The novel peptide activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 prevents alcohol-induced fetal death and developmental and learning abnormalities in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. This demonstrates that a single treatment with a peptide is efficacious and may be of value in the prevention of alcohol-induced damage. © 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to cognitive processing speed and efficiency in childhood

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to deficits in processing speed in both infancy and later in childhood. This study was designed to examine prenatal alcohol-related deficits in both processing speed and processing efficiency in four domains of cognitive function. Methods: Black children (n = 337; age, 7.5 years), prospectively recruited to over-represent prenatal alcohol exposure at moderate-to-heavy levels, were assessed on four processing speed tasks, using a Sternberg paradigm. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to contrast overall processing speed, indicated by reaction time (RT) differences at the intercept, with processing efficiency, indicated by the slope of RT changes across increasing levels of task difficulty. Performance on these tasks within an effortful cognitive framework was compared with RT on a task involving relatively more automatic processing. Path analysis was used to examine the degree to which the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on working memory was mediated by slower RT. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with slower processing speed on several of the Sternberg tasks, and the number comparison task showed a specific deficit in processing efficiency. These effects on tasks involving effortful processing contrasted with the lack of performance differences on the more automatic RT measure. The relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to working memory was mediated, in part, by an associated reduction in processing speed. Conclusions: These data confirm reports by other investigators linking prenatal alcohol exposure to slower processing speed and show that this RT deficit is found within the context of complex cognition but not where automatic processing is involved. The reduction in RT accounts, in part, for the previously reported alcohol-related effects on working memory. The number comparison slope was the only specific component of information processing affected, confirming previous reports of a distinctive prenatal alcohol effect on number processing.

T1  - Executive functioning and working memory in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
A1  - Rasmussen C.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The goal of this report is to critically review research on executive functioning (EF) and working memory in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Individuals with FASD exhibit EF deficits in the areas of cognitive flexibility, planning and strategy use, verbal reasoning, some aspects of inhibition, set shifting, fluency, working memory, and, recently, on tests of emotion-related or hot EF. Some researchers have linked prenatal alcohol exposure to abnormalities in the development of the frontal cortex of affected individuals or animals. One common finding is that these EF deficits persist regardless of whether the individual has facial dysmorphology. Furthermore, EF deficits are not simply due to a low IQ in these individuals. More research with larger sample sizes, smaller age ranges, and consistent measurement tools is needed in this area to ameliorate some inconsistencies in the literature. Furthermore, researchers should now focus on studying the pattern of weakness in EF in individuals with FASD as well as relations among working memory and EF, which will help to identify specific areas of weakness, to enhance diagnosis, and to improve treatment. There is limited research on the development of EF in individuals with FASD, which can have important implications for understanding of how these deficits unfold from childhood through adulthood.

N2  - Maternal alcohol exposure results in a variety of neurodevelopmental abnormalities that include cognitive and sensorimotor dysfunctions that often persist into adulthood. Many reports of central nervous system disturbances associated within a clinical diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome point toward disturbances in central information processing. In this study, we used the rat barrel field cortex as a model system to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the organization and size of the large whisker representation in layer IV of the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF) in somatosensory cortex. Pregnant rats (Sprague-Dawley) were intragastrically gavaged daily with alcohol doses (6 gm/kg body weight) from gestational day 1 to day 20 in a chronic binge pattern which produced blood alcohol levels ranging between 260 mg/dl and 324 mg/dl. Chow-fed (CF), pair-fed (PF), and cross-foster (XF) groups served as normal, nutritionally matched, and maternal controls, respectively, for the ethanol-exposed (EtOH) treatment group. All pups were examined on gestational day 32 corresponding approximately to postnatal day 9. EtOH and control group pups were weighed, anesthetized, and perfused. Brains were removed and weighed, with and without cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, and the neocortex was removed and weighed. Cortices were then flattened, sectioned tangentially, and stained with a metabolic marker-cytochrome oxidase-to reveal the barrel field. A subset of 27 cortical barrels, associated with the representation of the large whisker pad, was selected to examine in detail. The major results were: (i) the total barrel field area comprising the PMBSF was significantly reduced in EtOH (by 17%) and XF (by 16%) pups compared with CF pups, (ii) the sizes of individual barrels within the PMBSF were also significantly reduced in EtOH (16%) and XF (18%) pups, (iii) the septal region between barrels was also significantly reduced in EtOH (18%) and XF (12%) pups, (iv) anteriorly located barrels underwent greater reduction in size relative to the posteriorly located barrels, (v) body weights were also significantly reduced in EtOH (21%) and XF (27%) pups, (vi) total brain weight [with and without (forebrain) cerebellum/olfactory bulbs] and cortical weights were also significantly reduced in EtOH (total brain weight 15%, forebrain weight 16%, cortical weight 15%) and XF (18%, 19%, 20%) pups, and in contrast (vi) neither the overall barrel field pattern nor the pattern of individual barrels in the PMBSF was altered. These findings suggest that PAE reduces body and brain weight as well as the central cortical representation of the whisker pad, while leaving the overall barrel field pattern unperturbed. While these results might appear to support a miniaturization hypothesis (smaller PMBSF, smaller brain, smaller body weight), PAE also shows regional vulnerability within the PMBSF whereby anteriorly located barrels are most affected. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Objective: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with cognitive, behavioral and social deficits, including delinquency. Although delinquent populations and those with intellectual and behavioral deficits exhibit impaired moral judgment and reasoning, this area remains unexplored in alcohol-exposed individuals. Method: Moral maturity and delinquency were evaluated in 27 participants with prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC group) and 29 nonexposed controls (CON group) matched on age (range: 10-18), gender, handedness, socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Moral maturity was evaluated using the Sociomoral Reflection Measure-Short Form, and delinquency was evaluated with the Conduct Disorder (CD) Questionnaire. Additional measures included social desirability and inhibition. Results: The ALC group performed at a lower level of moral maturity than the CON group. Whereas Verbal IQ primarily predicted this difference, a deficit on the moral value judgment having to do with relationships with others was specific to prenatal alcohol exposure. Furthermore, delinquency was higher in the ALC group, and specific sociomoral values were predictive of delinquent behavior. Finally, half of the children and adolescents with a history of prenatal alcohol exposure but without fetal alcohol syndrome had probable CD. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that interventions aimed at reducing delinquency in those with prenatal alcohol exposure are necessary, and targeting moral judgment for this purpose may be beneficial.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and associated disorders resulting from maternal alcohol use during gestation are among the most common developmental disorders. However, they are rarely diagnosed and not fully understood in terms of their behavioral and neurocognitive phenorype. Prenatal exposure leads to alterations in facial morphology, growth, and neurocognition. The nature and extent of teratogenic effects on the brain and the relationship between such effects and observed behaviors remain in debate because there are no established markers for the neurological effects of exposure. In this study, we examined the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on white-matter integrity in the corpus callosum by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and herein describe the relationship between such effects and observed physical and behavioral outcomes. Methods: DTI was used to evaluate diffusion anisotropy in the genu and splenium of corpus callosum in 16 low-income, primarily African-American volunteers. Volunteers were recruited from a cohort of young adults who had received neuropsychological evaluations during adolescence. Nine had been prenatally exposed to alcohol and had characteristics of FAS, and seven were nonexposed controls. Results: Significant difference in the means for diffusion fractional anisotropy (t = 2.26, df = 9, p < 0.002) and apparent diffusion coefficient (t = 2.14, df = 14, p < 0.008) were observed in the corpus callosum of alcohol-exposed youth compared with nonexposed youth. No significant differences were found in intracranial volume between these groups. Conclusions: Our results illustrate that DTI can be used in evaluating the integrity of corpus callosum in alcohol-exposed individuals. If future studies support these findings, diffusion anisotropy, represented by fractional anisotropy, has the potential to be used as a clinical marker in the diagnosis of FAS.

N2  - Background: Since chronic alcohol use suppresses the adult immune system, we tested the hypothesis that maternal alcohol ingestion increases the risk of infection in term newborns. Methods: Analysis of a large case-control study of birth weight for gestational age was performed focusing on maternal alcohol ingestion and the development of infection in term newborns > 36 weeks gestation. After delivery, mothers were asked about alcohol and tobacco use in the 3 months prior to conception, the 1st, 2nd, and 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. Results: Eight hundred and seventy-two singleton newborns (872) > 36 weeks gestation were identified for analysis. A total of 51 (5.8%) had newborn infections. Gestational age, sex, and small for gestational age (SGA) were similar in the newborns with and without infection (p = NS). Infants whose mothers reported alcohol use, excessive drinking or smoking in pregnancy were more likely to have a newborn diagnosed with an infection than were mothers who reported abstaining from alcohol or cigarettes (p < 0.05). When controlling for race and smoking, SGA infants whose mothers used any alcohol had a 2.5-fold increase risk of infection, while excessive alcohol use increased the risk 3-4-fold. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for low maternal income, smoking, and SGA, excessive alcohol use during the 2nd trimester increased the risk of newborn infection (OR 3.7 [1.1,12.8], p < 0.05). Conclusions: Excessive maternal alcohol use is associated with an increased risk of newborn infection in this patient sample. Increased awareness and further clinical investigations are warranted to address the detrimental effects of fetal alcohol exposure on the developing immune system.

N2  - Objectives. We defined risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a region with the highest documented prevalence of FAS in the world. Methods. We compared mothers of 53 first-grade students with FAS (cases) with 116 randomly selected mothers of first-grade students without FAS (controls). Results. Differences between case and control mothers in our study population existed regarding socioeconomic status, religiosity, education, gravidity, parity, and marital status. Mothers of children with FAS came from alcohol-abusing families in which heavy drinking was almost universal; control mothers drank little to no alcohol. Current and past alcohol use by case mothers was characterized by heavy binge drinking on weekends, with no reduction of use during pregnancy in 87% of the mothers. Twenty percent of control mothers drank during pregnancy, a rate that declined to 12.7% by the third trimester. The percentage who smoked during pregnancy was higher for case mothers than for control mothers (75.5% vs 30.3%), but the number of cigarettes smoked was low among case mothers. The incidence of FAS in offspring of relatively young women (28 years) was not explained by early drinking onset or years of drinking (mean, 7.6 years among case mothers). In addition to traditional FAS risk factors, case mothers were smaller in height, weight, head circumference, and body mass index, all anthropomorphic measures that indicate poor nutrition and second-generation fetal alcohol exposure. Conclusions. Preventive interventions are needed to address maternal risk factors for FAS.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Clinical reports indicate a poor quality of life (QOL) among individuals with FASD; however, QOL has not been formally assessed and reported in this population. We describe psychosocial and QOL assessment scores among 11 women with FASD. These women had poor QOL scores and high levels of mental health disorders and behavioral problems relative to standardization samples and other at-risk populations. We suggest that psychiatric distress may play a substantial role in the reduced quality of life reported among adults with FASD.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: An overview with emphasis on changes in brain and behavior
A1  - Riley E.P.
A1  - McGee C.L.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders constitute a major public health problem. This article presents an overview of important issues that surround these disorders and emphasizes the structural and neurobehavioral consequences associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol. Diagnostic criteria are discussed, and possible moderating factors for the range of outcomes are mentioned. In addition, the prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is described, and estimates of the financial impact of these disorders are given. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure can severely affect the physical and neurobehavioral development of a child. Autopsy and brain imaging studies indicate reductions and abnormalities in overall brain size and shape, specifically in structures such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. A wide range of neuropsychological deficits have been found in children prenatally exposed to alcohol, including deficits in visuospatial functioning, verbal and nonverbal learning, attention, and executive functioning. These children also exhibit a variety of behavioral problems that can further affect their daily functioning. Children exposed to alcohol prenatally, with and without the physical features of fetal alcohol syndrome, display qualitatively similar deficits. Determining the behavioral phenotypes that result from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is critical, because the identification of these children is crucial for early interventions. In addition, knowing which brain areas are involved might enable the development of better intervention strategies. However, intervention needs to go beyond the affected individual to prevent future cases. As evidenced by the staggering financial impact these disorders have on society, prevention efforts need to be aimed at high-risk groups, and this issue needs to be made a high priority in terms of public health.

N2  - Background: Alcohol exposure during the fetal stage generates variable severity in different organs, as seen in fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect. Whether genetic factors or conditions of alcohol exposure influence the susceptibility to alcohol-related developmental impairment remains a question. Methods: To investigate the contribution of genotype to the susceptibility to alcohol-induced toxicity during development beyond confounding maternal factors and variables of alcohol exposures, the authors tested the effect of alcohol exposure under definitive concentration using a whole embryonic culture of two inbred strains previously known to be vulnerable (C57BL/6 [C6]) or resistant (DBA/2 [D2]) to alcohol. On gestational day 8, embryos from each group bearing three to six somites were collected and then cultured for 44 hr in a medium added with 400 mg/dl of ethanol. The viability and morphological malformations, as well as developmental staging of the embryos, were all scored at the end of the culture. Results: The authors found, in contrast to previous reports, that alcohol treatment retarded embryonic growth and induced abnormalities, including the neural tube opening and the hypoplasia of the optic vesicle in both strains. However, alcohol specifically compromised the heart and caudal neural tube in C6, whereas it specifically decreased the number of somites and the development of branchial bars among others in D2. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that both strains of embryos are vulnerable to the same amount and pattern of alcohol exposures at the same developmental stage, but each with unique vulnerability in specific organs, with alcohol having greater teratogenic effects in D2 than in C6. These differential vulnerabilities are results of greater genetic influence, rather than the maternal influence or conditions of alcohol. Copyright © 2005 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure produces many developmental defects in the central nervous system. The underlying molecular mechanism, however, has not been fully understood. The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) in offspring. The pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received 1 or 3 g/kg of alcohol or an isocaloric solution by intragastric intubation once a day from gestational day (GD) 5 to GD 20. On postnatal day 7-8, pups were killed and the hippocampus, striatum, cortex, and cerebellum dissected out. Levels of BDNF mRNA and proteins, total TrkB proteins and receptor phosphorylation were measured. The results showed that prenatal alcohol exposure at the dose of 1 g/kg/day did not significantly affect BDNF protein levels in any region examined. However, administration of alcohol at the dose of 3 g/kg/day markedly reduced levels of BDNF protein and mRNA in the cortex and hippocampus of offspring. Western blotting showed that prenatal alcohol exposure at the dose of 3 g/kg/day also inhibited TrkB phosphorylation in the hippocampus although no changes in total TrkB protein levels were observed in any region examined. Our data suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure alters both presynaptic and postsynaptic BDNF function in certain brain areas of offspring. These alterations in BDNF function may contribute to the development of alcohol-related birth defects. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Neuroanatomical and behavioral evidence indicate that the cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Recent research has shown impairments in eyeblink conditioning in rats following binge-like neonatal ethanol exposure. The neural substrates of eyeblink conditioning have been localized to the cerebellum and related brainstem mechanisms. The present study considered whether heavy prenatal alcohol exposure would result in similar impairments in eyeblink conditioning in children. A related purpose was to determine if eyeblink conditioning could discriminate between children with prenatal alcohol exposure and children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactive disorder or developmental dyslexia. Fifty-three age-matched children [10 prenatal alcohol exposure (FAE), 16 attention deficit hyperactive disordered (ADHD), 14 children with dyslexia (DYS), 13 normal controls] were assessed on eyeblink conditioning in the delay paradigm. Children in the FAE and DYS groups failed to learn the conditioned response, producing longer latencies and poorly timed responses to the conditioning stimulus. Children with ADHD were impaired on measures of adaptively timed responses, although conditioned responses matched normal controls. The results suggest that children prenatally exposed to alcohol have deficits in cerebellar processing similar to those with dyslexia, and that these functional deficits are related to disabilities in learning.

N2  - Background: A broad range of attentional and neuropsychological impairments have been demonstrated in children with fetal alcohol exposure. This study was designed to investigate which specific aspects of attentional function are most directly affected by moderate to heavy doses of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: A total of 337 black children who were aged 7.5 years and recruited prospectively to overrepresent prenatal alcohol exposure at moderate to heavy levels were assessed on a diverse battery of neuropsychological tests. Principal components analyses were used to replicate and extend Mirsky et al.'s (1991) four-component model of attention. The relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to empirically derived attentional constructs was examined. Results: Both the replicated and the extended attentional models produced solutions similar to the original Mirsky et al. model, reflecting elements of encode (working memory), shift, and focused and sustained attention, as well as a distinct component reflecting impulsivity. Adverse effects of maternal drinking across pregnancy were found primarily for working memory, and these effects were exacerbated when mothers were aged 30 or older at the time of the child's birth. Conclusions: These data confirm previous studies using diverse methods that suggest that working memory may be the most important aspect of attention that is adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background. There is still an ongoing discussion whether moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy is harmful to the fetus. In most western countries, however, total abstinence is recommended. Material and methods. Over the last five years we have seen 64 infants and children with alcohol-related disorders. We present the clinical records of one alcohol-damaged child, and present the latest recommended categorisation of alcohol-related disorders in infants and children. Results. In our experience, some women with heavy alcohol consumption are allowed to continue their abuse without interference from health professionals. Children of women with moderate alcohol consumption may be seriously damaged. Updated research on pregnancy and alcohol that we have reviewed provide clear evidence that brain structure as well as brain function are affected by heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Interpretation. Use of alcohol in pregnancy, also in moderate amounts, is a serious risk factor for fetal damage. Therefore complete abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy should be recommended. For the alcohol-damaged children, early recognition and appropriate treatment will give the child a better opportunity for future optimal development.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can induce a wide spectrum of adverse effects in offspring. Microcephaly and mental retardation are two major defects of central nervous system (CNS). Most mechanism studies of alcohol-related CNS defects have been focused on the morphologically abnormal tissues, and more attention has been paid to nuclear alteration as opposed to organelle development. METHODS: A mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was used to investigate the effect of alcohol on fetal cerebral mitochondria development. Pregnant mice were given different doses of ethanol intragastrically from GD6 to GD15. Fetal cerebral mitochondria were isolated and analyzed on GD18. RESULTS: Excessive cell apoptosis was found in the cerebra of prenatal alcohol exposure fetuses. Proliferation and differentiation of fetal cerebral mitochondria were inhibited by alcohol. Affected mitochondrial volume constriction and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) accumulation, reduced activities of respiratory chain complex I and IV and ATP synthase were detected in the cerebral tissue without obvious malformed appearance. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired mitochondria development plays a role in the CNS defects induced by prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can frequently lead to a congenital disorder known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS); however, not all children born to alcoholic women develop FAS. Alcohol consumption may affect diverse organs and systems during embryonic development, including craniofacial structures. Small teeth, enamel alterations, and delayed eruption have been observed after ethanol exposure. Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGF-Rs) participate in dental proliferation and differentiation, and changes in these receptors were considered here to be a likely mechanism associated to the dental anomalies observed in this syndrome. Epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (EGF-R) and epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (erbB-2) immunoexpression during the lower first molar morphogenesis was investigated in mouse fetuses exposed to ethanol during gestation. METHODS: Pregnant female mice were divided into groups, consuming either 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25% ethanol solutions, or water (control group). Heads were obtained from 16.5- and 18.5-day fetuses. Immunohistochemistry was applied to EGF-R and erbB-2. RESULTS: At days 16.5 and 18.5, fetuses from 15%, 20%, and 25% ethanol groups showed delayed differentiation, degenerative changes in dental epithelial tissues and reduced dental size; additionally, they displayed an enhanced immunoreactivity to EGF-R and erbB-2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ethanol consumption during pregnancy affects the expression of EGF receptors and induces a delay in murine fetal dental morphogenesis. Dental development is a process that involves a number of growth factors; hence we consider that further research is required to show whether the changes in glycosylation and growth-factor signaling pathways observed in other cells are also involved in the alterations observed in this study. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) are often diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These children show increases in reaction time (RT) variability and false alarms on choice reaction time (CRT) tasks. In this study, adult rats prenatally exposed to ethanol were trained to perform a CRT task. An analysis of the distribution of RTs obtained from the CRT task found that rats with a history of prenatal ethanol exposure had more variable RT distributions, possibly because of lapses of attention. In addition, it was found that, similar to children with FASD, the ethanol-exposed rats had more false alarms. Thus, rats with prenatal ethanol exposure show attention deficits that are similar to those of children with FASD and ADHD.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), the strongest manifestation of FASD, results in short stature, microcephally and facial dysmorphogenesis including microphthalmia. Using Xenopus embryos as a model developmental system, we show that ethanol exposure recapitulates many aspects of FAS, including a shortened rostro-caudal axis, microcephally and microphthalmia. Temporal analysis revealed that Xenopus embryos are most sensitive to ethanol exposure between late blastula and early/mid gastrula stages. This window of sensitivity overlaps with the formation and early function of the embryonic organizer, Spemann's organizer. Molecular analysis revealed that ethanol exposure of embryos induces changes in the domains and levels of organizer-specific gene expression, identifying Spemann's organizer as an early target of ethanol. Ethanol also induces a defect in convergent extension movements that delays gastrulation movements and may affect the overall length. We show that mechanistically, ethanol is antagonistic to retinol (Vitamin A) and retinal conversion to retinoic acid, and that the organizer is active in retinoic acid signaling during early gastrulation. The model suggests that FASD is induced in part by an ethanol-dependent reduction in retinoic acid levels that are necessary for the normal function of Spemann's organizer. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Inner-city, black women are among those groups that are at higher risk for having infants with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders that can include life-long neurobehavioral and cognitive impairments. Chronic alcohol consumption can decrease amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a fatty acid that is essential for optimal infant neural and retinal development in a variety of tissues. Methods: Black women who presented at an inner-city antenatal clinic for their first prenatal visit were recruited into a longitudinal, observational study. Alcohol intake was determined by a structured interview. Participants provided blood specimens and completed food frequency surveys at 24 weeks of gestation, infant delivery, and 3 months postpartum. Fatty acid composition analyses were completed on 307, 260, and 243 for plasma and 278, 261, and 242 erythrocyte specimens at 24 weeks of gestation, delivery, and 3 months postpartum, respectively. Results: Proportion of drinking days at the first prenatal visit was associated with decreased DHA in plasma and erythrocytes throughout the study. This association was the strongest at 24 weeks of gestation. In addition, an interaction between proportion of drinking days at the time of conception and ounces of absolute alcohol per drinking day at the time of conception was detected and demonstrated that, in daily drinkers, high intakes of alcohol are associated with decreased DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations in plasma. Conclusions: Frequent and high intakes of alcohol that have been previously associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are also associated with decreased maternal DHA and AA plasma concentrations. The present findings indicate that maternal DHA deficiency is associated with high-risk drinking and may contribute to the mechanism(s) of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

T1  - Alcohol consumption among women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant--United States, 2002
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with health problems that adversely affect the mother and fetus; no level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been determined safe. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is recognized as the foremost preventable condition involving neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities. Women who drink during pregnancy place themselves at risk for having a child with FAS or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To determine the alcohol consumption patterns among all women of childbearing age, including those who are pregnant or might become pregnant, CDC analyzed data for women aged 18-44 years from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. The results of that analysis indicated that approximately 10% of pregnant women used alcohol, and approximately 2% engaged in binge drinking or frequent use of alcohol. The results further indicated that more than half of women who did not use birth control (and therefore might become pregnant) reported alcohol use and 12.4% reported binge drinking. Women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant should abstain from alcohol use.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) consists of multi-system abnormalities and is caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of alcohol on humans has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and FAS is one of the most important human teratogenic conditions known today. Many investigators have catalogued, quantified and refined these hallmarks of FAS over the years and have established that the most consistent consequences of heavy maternal drinking during pregnancy are prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and brain and craniofacial abnormalities. Many practitioners are unable to recognise the often subtle features associated with FAS and fail to diagnose it. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and discuss the relevance of FAS to clinical dental practice.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes a major risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). This article defines the three syndromes linked to alcohol consumption during pregnancy: (1) FAS, with or without confirmed maternal alcohol exposure; (2) alcohol-related birth defect (ARBD) (3) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). The article also reviews data on alcohol use in pregnant women and in women of child-bearing age. The literature indicates that between 6% and 45% pregnant women have an at-risk alcohol use, and suggests that brief counseling interventions designed to prevent at-risk alcohol use are effective. Studies assessing alcohol use and brief intervention efficacy in pregnant women in Switzerland are needed.

N2  - This study examined the relationship between moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure, prenatal stress, and postnatal response to a challenging event in 6-month-old rhesus monkeys. Forty-one rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) infants were exposed prenatally to moderate level alcohol, maternal stress, or both. Offspring plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) were determined from blood samples before maternal separation and after separation. Behavioral observations were made repeatedly across separation. Moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with significantly higher plasma ACTH response to maternal separation. Offspring exposed to prenatal alcohol, prenatal stress, and prenatal alcohol and stress showed reduced behavioral adaptation to stress compared with controls. Baseline, 2-hr, and 26-hr plasma ACTH levels were intercorrelated and predicted behavior during separation.

T1  - Effect of a single dose of ethanol on developing skeletal muscle of chick embryos
A1  - Chaudhuri J.D.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Many of these affected children show retarded physical growth in the postnatal period despite adequate nutrition. On the basis of findings from studies with animals, it has been proposed that this is due to allometric retardation of growth of skeletal muscle, although the exact reasons for this are not known. The aim of the current study was to examine the structural changes in skeletal muscle in fetal alcohol syndrome in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of growth retardation in fetal alcohol syndrome. Chick embryos were exposed to single doses of 5%, 10%, and 15% ethanol, and the effects on the general growth and development, as well as on the skeletal muscle, of these chicks were studied. There was a significant retardation in crown rump length, head circumference, and body weight in ethanol-exposed chicks when these parameters were compared with findings for appropriate control groups. This retardation was associated with significant and proportionate reductions in the weights of skeletal muscles. Microscopic examination of skeletal muscle showed areas of neutrophil infiltration and necrosis, suggestive of muscle damage, in chicks exposed to 10% and 15% ethanol. Thus, findings of the current study demonstrate the direct toxic effects of a single dose of ethanol on developing embryos in general and skeletal muscle in particular. The pathologic changes seen in skeletal muscle could account for the failure in postnatal growth in fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can cause limb and digit defects. Variations in digit ratios in humans are associated with prenatal testosterone exposure. Since prenatal alcohol can reduce testosterone in rats, the effects of prenatal alcohol were measured on rat digit length. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated with 0 g/kg, 4 g/kg, or 6 g/kg of ethanol from Gestational Day 8 (GD8) to GD20. The 0-g/kg group and a nonintubated group served as controls. At postnatal day 31, forepaw digit lengths were measured and digit ratios calculated. Females had smaller digits on both forepaws and higher digit ratios on the right forepaw than males. Rats exposed to 6 g/kg of ethanol had smaller digits than controls on both forepaws and higher digit ratios than controls on the left forepaw. Rat digit ratios differ between the sexes, and prenatal alcohol exposure affects digit ratios. The results are consistent with a perinatal disruption of testosterone levels by alcohol and/or of testosterone's effects on digit length and ratios. An alternate interpretation is consistent with a retinoic acid-mediated effect of alcohol on digit length and ratios. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Objective: National initiatives on fetal alcohol syndrome in Canada and the United States aimed at prevention, identification, and treatment of individuals who are affected by alcohol exposure in utero recommend that women abstain from consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Health care providers are key educators regarding appropriate alcohol use. The objective of this study was to describe characteristics of physicians who recommend alcohol abstinence during pregnancy with regard to knowledge of fetal alcohol syndrome and preconception counseling strategies. Methods: A survey was mailed to Canadian physicians and midwives between 2001 and 2002. Participants consisted of a national random sample of 1090 Canadian obstetricians and gynecologists, midwives, and family physicians who were current members of provincial and national professional organizations. The main outcome measure was questionnaire responses to knowledge, prevention, and diagnosis of issues related to alcohol use during pregnancy. Results: Response rates ranged from 31.1% among family physicians to 63.5% among midwives. Overall, 91.2% of providers recommended abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. These providers were significantly more likely to believe that there is sufficient information about alcohol use and that clients were interested in discussing alcohol (p < 0.05). They were also significantly more likely to discuss depression, personal alcohol use, partner's use of alcohol, and family history of alcohol misuse with women of childbearing age (p < 0.05). Once a patient became pregnant, fewer practice differences were noted, although those who recommended alcohol abstinence were significantly more likely to take clinical action when pregnant patients were consuming moderate amounts of alcohol (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It is encouraging that almost 90% of Canadian health care providers recommend abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. However, differences in clinical practice exist between providers who recommend alcohol abstinence during pregnancy as compared with those who recommend a "glass in moderation".

N2  - Background: In contrast to the extensive literature documenting IQ deficits in patients with fetal alcohol syndrome, effects on IQ have not generally been reported for children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). This study examined the role of maternal age, MAST, and quality of parenting in moderating the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the WISC-III IQ test in moderate-to-heavily exposed children. Methods: A total of 337 inner-city African American children whose mothers were recruited prenatally were administered the WISC-III at 7.5 years. Alcohol exposure was assesed with a timeline follow-back interview administered at every prenatal clinic visit. Moderating effects of the three risk factors were examined by adding interaction terms to regression analyses and dichotomizing the moderators and performing separate regressions on the two groups. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was related to WISC-III Freedom from Distractibility but not to Full Scale IQ for the sample as a whole. However, among children born to older mothers, an alcohol effect emerged on Full Scale IQ and five of seven composite IQ scores. Similarly, adverse effects were seen among children of MAST-positive mothers and children whose parents provided less optimal cognitive stimulation. Each additional ounce of absolute alcohol consumed per day during pregnancy was associated with a 2.9-point decrease in Full Scale IQ and a 5.6-point decrement on Freedom from Distractibility. Conclusions: This study is the first to demonstrate IQ effects among children with ARND born to older and MAST-positive mothers, particularly in relation to first-trimester drinking. These findings suggest that there are subgroups of more vulnerable and severely affected children whose intellectual performance is compromised. A moderate- to heavy-drinking mother who has given birth to an unaffected child when she was younger needs to be warned that her risk of having an adversely affected child increases as she grows older.

N2  - Aims: To determine the alcohol exposure and pharmacokinetics of alcohol in a group of women who had given birth to children wit FAS, compared with women who had not given birth to FAS children. Methods: 10 women who had given birth to FAS children (FAS mothers) and 20 Controls were studied to determine how they metabolize alcohol in a single limited-access quasi-experimental session of voluntary consumption of alcohol. They had free choice in the consumption of any amount of their favourite beverage for ~2.5 h, but their drinking was terminated if the breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) exceeded 150 mg%. BrACs was measured during ethanol consumption and for several hours after, for estimation of alcohol exposure and pharmacokinetics. Results: FAS mothers consumed significantly larger amounts of alcohol, and achieved significantly higher peak BrAC levels than Controls. The rate of decline of alcohol from the circulation (beta-60) showed a 2-fold variation across subjects but there was no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions: This study did not show any difference in alcohol pharmacokinetics in free-choice drinking by non-pregnant women, who either have given or have never given birth to FAS children. However, mothers of FAS children tend to consume more alcohol per session. Future studies in larger samples will be needed to confirm these findings and to examine drinking patterns and other factors that may increase the risk of FAS in children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © Medical Council on Alcohol 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in morphological abnormalities in the fetuses of humans and experimental animals, and is referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, the molecular mechanism underlying FAS has not been completely elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced FAS in the developing embryo and fetus. cDNA microarray analysis was used to screen for altered gene profiles. Ethanol at a teratogenic dosage (3.8 g/kg, twice a day) was administered intraperitoneally to pregnant C57BI/6J mice from gestation day (GD) 6 to 8. Morphologic observations showed excessive malformations of the craniofacial regions (reduction of the face, the absence of eyes, nose, jaw, and mandible, underdevelopment of vibrissae areas, cleft lip, and palate) in ethanol-exposed embryos (GD 10) and fetusus (GD 75). cDNA microarray analysis showed alterations in several gene profiles, including the "palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone (plunc)," "neurofilament," and "pale ear." Of these genes, the expressions of plunc were confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and whole-mount in situ hybridization. The plunc was highly expressed in the craniofacial region, specifically in upper airways and nasopharyngeal epithelium. RT-PCR analysis revealed that normal plunc mRNA expression levels were present in GD 75 fetuses, but not in GD 10 embryos. Interestingly, ethanol significantly downregulated the plunc expression in GD 75 fetuses. Our results suggest that ethanol-induced FAS is due in part to the downregulation of plunc expression in the fetus, and this gene may be a candidate biological marker for FAS.

N2  - Alcohol-related pathologies lead to most serious expressions, both at clinical and social level. The diffused social acceptance of consumption and abuse behavior and the lack of alcohol education for professionals (physicians, psychologists, social workers etc.) make difficult to put in the right frame this issue. Just a multidimensional approach can make the problem understandable. The history of alcohol consumption during the time gives us an exhaustive picture of the negative consequences of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a problem still underestimated and represents a serious risk for the health of the newborns: children alcohol-exposed in uterus are at risk to develop many pathologies and even the fetal-alcohol syndrome (FAS) that leads to facial anomalies, growth deficiencies and neurological damages. Therefore interventions coping with this kind of issues are needed in order to enhance people's health.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome prevention in Washington State: Evidence of success
A1  - Astley S.J.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a permanent birth defect syndrome caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. It is characterised by growth deficiency, central nervous system damage/dysfunction, and a unique cluster of minor facial anomalies. To assess the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts, one must be able to estimate accurately the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome over time in population-based samples. With the establishment of the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network of clinics, the development of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Facial Photographic Analysis Software, the creation of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the establishment of the Foster Care Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Screening Program, and the collection of Pregnancy Risk Assessment Management System data on maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy, the tools, methods and infrastructure for assessing the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome primary prevention efforts in Washington State are in place. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine whether the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among children in a foster care population, born between 1993 and 1998, decreased with the documented decrease in prevalence of maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy from 1993 and 1998 in Washington State. The prevalence of maternal drinking during pregnancy in Washington State declined significantly (P < 0.001) from 1993 to 1998 as did the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among foster children born 1993-98 (P < 0.03). These observations support the likelihood that fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts in Washington State are working successfully.

N2  - The goal of this study was to examine differential effects of amount and pattern of prenatal alcohol exposure on child outcome. Alcohol use was assessed at each prenatal visit, and IQ and behavior were measured at age 7 years. After control for confounders, the amount of exposure was unrelated to IQ score and behavior for >500 black 7-year-old children. However, children who were exposed to binge drinking were 1.7 times more likely to have IQ scores in the mentally retarded range and 2.5 times more likely to have clinically significant levels of delinquent behavior. During prenatal care, clinicians should attend not only to amount but also to the pattern of alcohol intake, because of the elevated risk for cognitive deficits and long-term behavioral abnormality. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Implicit strategy affects learning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Roebuck-Spencer T.M.
A1  - Mattson S.N.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Learning and memory deficits are commonly reported in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Our recent work suggested that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure retained information as well as controls on a verbal learning test but not on a test of nonverbal learning and memory. To better understand the cause of this differential pattern of performance, the current study re-analyzed data from our previous study to determine if the presence of an implicit learning strategy may account, at least in part, for the finding of spared retention. Methods: The current study examined verbal learning and memory abilities in 35 children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and 34 nonexposed controls (CON) matched for age (9-16 years), sex, ethnicity, handedness, and socioeconomic status. Groups were compared on two measures of verbal learning, one with an implicit strategy (California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version; CVLT-C) and one without (Verbal Learning subtest of the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning; VL-WRAML). Results: Children with FASD learned less information overall than children in the CON group. Both groups learned a greater percentage of information and reached a learning plateau earlier on the CVLT-C compared with the VL-WRAML. Groups also showed comparable rates of retention after a delay on the CVLT-C. In contrast, on the VL-WRAML, children with FASD showed poorer retention rates than children in the CON group. Interestingly, children with FASD did not differ from children in the CON group on CVLT-C semantic clustering scores for learning trials 1 through 3, and greater utilization of semantic clustering was correlated with better learning and memory performance in both groups. This overall pattern of results was not related to overall intellectual level. Conclusions: The finding of spared retention of verbal information on the CVLT-C in our earlier studies may be related to test characteristics of the CVLT-C rather than a finding of spared verbal retention per se, given that spared retention was not found on a separate test of verbal learning and memory without an implicit learning strategy. These results suggest that the use of an implicit strategy positively affected the ability of alcohol-exposed children to learn and retain new verbal information.

N2  - Aim: To relate structural and functional findings in one adolescent dizygotic twin pair with prenatal alcohol exposure. Method: Neuropsychological and volumetric magnetic resonance studies were carried out on a 13-year-old preterm dizygotic twin pair with prenatal alcohol exposure. Results: Neuropsychological and brain structural findings differed between the twins. The child with the more affected phenotype had large-scale cognitive deficits and presented significant atrophy in several brain structures. Both subjects had white matter volume reductions relative to the whole cerebral volume. Conclusion: The neuropsychological and neuroimaging data reflect long-term consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. © Medical Council on Alcohol 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a group of clinical features which appears in the fetus after prenatal alcohol exposure. It is a well known fact that alcohol is the most frequent teratogenic agent, and that its effects can be prevented, should alcoholic intake be avoided during pregnancy. Physical, neurologic and behavioral anomalies can show even after low doses. We try to update in this paper the diagnostic criteria of FAS, to point out the main aspects of alcohol metabolism, its relationship with the placenta and the possible mechanisms of its teratogenic action. We report the clinical features of 13 patients diagnosed at our institution during the last 15 years.

T1  - Prenatal programming of adult thyroid function by alcohol and thyroid hormones
A1  - Wilcoxon J.S.
A1  - Redei E.E.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Increasing evidence associates environmental challenges early in life with permanent alterations of physiological functions in adulthood. These changes in fetal environment can trigger physiological adaptations by the fetus, called fetal programming, which may be beneficial before birth but permanently influence the physiology of the organism. In this study, we investigated the potential connection between alcohol-induced decreased maternal thyroid function and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) function of adult rat offspring. Plasma 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were decreased in alcohol-consuming (E) dams on gestational day 21 compared with ad libitum- (C) and pair-fed (PF) controls. No significant differences were found in HPT function in young offspring (3 wk of age) between diet groups. However, adult fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) offspring had significantly decreased levels of T3 along with elevated TSH compared with control offspring. T 4 administration to the mother did not normalize the hypothyroid state of the adult FAE offspring. Interestingly, administration of T4 to control pregnant dams decreased plasma T3 of the adult female offspring only, whereas T4 together with maternal alcohol consumption or pair-feeding led to decreased TSH and T4 in the adult female offspring. Our results suggest that ethanol consumption and T4 administration alter maternal HPT function, leading to prenatally programmed permanent alterations in the thyroid function of the adult offspring.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - We compared the rate of all-cause mortality in siblings of children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) with the siblings of matched controls. The siblings of children with FAS had increased mortality (11.4%) compared with matched controls (2.0%), a 530% increase in mortality. The age of death in case siblings deaths occurred later (between 1 day and 7 years) compared with the controls (1 day to 4 years) [odds ratio (OR) = 2.4 (0.4-15.6)]. Siblings of children with FAS had increased risk of death due to infectious illness [OR = 13.7 (1.2-361)] and sudden infant death syndrome compared with controls [OR = 10.2 (1.2-75.1)]. A diagnosis of FAS is an important risk marker for mortality in the siblings of the proband even if they do not have FAS. Maternal alcoholism appears to be a useful risk marker for increased mortality risk in diagnosed cases and their siblings. This has important implications in the management of family members of children with FAS.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which may increase the risk of confinement in the corrections system. In the United States each state and four major cities' corrections systems were asked to complete a questionnaire on the prevalence of FAS and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) in the offender population, the availability of screening and diagnostic services to identify offenders with FAS and staff training needs related to FAS. The total population in the 54 entities was 3 080904 inmates. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 42 entities (78%). The mean rate of reported substance abuse in offenders was 60.1%. Specialized programs for persons with mental retardation were reported for 44.4% of corrections facilities and 25.9% of community corrections facilities. Programs for pregnant women were reported for 46.3% of corrections facilities and 29.6% of community facilities. One program (1.9%) reported having a screening program for FAS in the corrections system. Only four programs (7.4%) reported having access to diagnostic services for FAS in the corrections facilities. Of the 3 080 904 offenders, only one offender was reported to have a diagnosis of FAS. Reported staff training needs were very large. In conclusion, corrections systems have high unmet needs to screen, identify, and treat offenders with FAS and ARND. Staff training needs are substantial.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes long-term serotonin neuron deficit in mice
A1  - Sari Y.
A1  - Zhou F.C.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Previous work from this laboratory showed that prenatal alcohol exposure at approximately 100 mg/dl from embryonic day (E)7 to early midgestation reduced the number and retarded the migration of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the raphe nuclei in C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we report that the deficit of 5-HT neurons found in midgestation persisted on E18 and into young adulthood. Methods: Pregnant dams were treated from E7 to E18 in three groups-(1) the alcohol group, fed with liquid diet with 25% ethanol-derived calories; (2) the isocaloric pair-fed group; and (3) the chow group for analysis of concentrations of active caspase-3-to study apoptosis at E18 in the brainstem and the number of 5-HT neurons at E18 and postnatal day 45. The concentrations of active caspase-3 were determined by using a colorimetric assay, and the 5-HT neurons were determined by immunocytochemistry. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure increased the concentration of active caspase-3 in the brainstem and caused reductions in brain weight by 20% and in the total number of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei by 20% at E18 as compared with those of the pair-fed and chow controls. Continuous observation from prenatal to postnatal stages showed that the reduction of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei persisted in the young adult stage. Conclusions: Upon prenatal alcohol exposure, an increased concentration of active caspase-3 and a decreased number of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the brainstem were observed at E18. The decreased number of 5-HT neurons persisted to the young adult stage of postnatal day 45. This suggests that ethanol has a long-lasting effect on 5-HT deficit. A fetal alcohol exposure-rendered lasting deficit of 5-HT and other transmitter systems may underlie the neuropsychiatric deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption by pregnant animals and humans leads to general growth impairment in their offspring, delayed growth and multiple birth defects collectively called "Fetal Alcohol Syndrome". In utero exposure of ethanol to rat pups causes damage to their developing intestinal epithelium which leads to impairment of nutrient assimilation and growth retardation during postnatal development. Aim To determine the effect of prenatal exposure of ethanol on the postnatal development of rat intestinal Na+-dependent and independent D-glucose transporter along with the amino acids (glycine and L-leucine) transporter activity at 4, 8, 14, 20 and 30 days of postnatal age. The changes in the expression levels of Na +-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1) mRNA was assessed at different days of postnatal age in rat pups. Methods: Wistar strain albino female rats were fed ethanol at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight/day orally by Ryle's tube for one month before mating and during the entire period of gestation while the control females received isocaloric glucose. Transport studies were performed using the everted intestine of 4, 8, 14, 20 and 30 day-old control and ethanol-exposed pups employing the tissue accumulation method. The expression of SGLT1 mRNA at different days of postnatal age in control and ethanol-exposed rat pups was determined using a Northern Blot analysis. Results: Prenatal exposure of ethanol to rat pups leads to a decrease in their body weight, intestinal length and weight and reduces the uptake capacities of SGLT1 as well as energy dependent glycine and L-leucine transporters with respect to their age-matched controls. However, the mRNA levels of SGLT1 remained unaltered in the ethanol-exposed pups at all ages of postnatal development compared to their controls. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in utero exposure to ethanol leads to a general delay in the postnatal development of the intestine of ethanol-exposed rat pups affecting mainly the development of intestinal energy dependent D-glucose and amino acid (glycine and L-leucine) transporters.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The classic clinical criteria for the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) include a "characteristic" facial appearance, pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, mental retardation, and occasional major malformations. However, diagnostic constraints, especially in the newborn period, lead to an underestimate of their prevalence. We report an epidemiological study of the potential risk of congenital defects in the offspring of mothers who ingested different sporadic and daily amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. METHODS: The study was based on the data from the ECEMC hospital-based case-control study and surveillance system, with a methodology aimed not only at the surveillance of congenital anomalies, but also at investigating their characteristics, clustering, and causes. For the purposes of this study, we considered as exposed those infants whose mothers reported the ingestion of any amount of alcohol during gestation (4705 mothers of cases and 4329 mothers of controls), and classified them into five groups according to their levels of alcohol consumption. Two groups consisted of mothers who consumed increasing sporadic levels and the other three consisted of mothers who consumed increasing daily levels of alcohol. RESULTS: Our study showed that even low sporadic doses of alcohol consumption during pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital anomalies in the offspring and that this risk increases with increasing levels of alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that it is necessary to generalize the preventive norm and recommend complete abstinence from alcohol during gestation. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Fetal, Infant, and Child Mortality in a Context of Alcohol Use
A1  - Burd L.
A1  - Wilson H.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Alcohol is an important element in the causal chain of risk for fetal, infant, and childhood mortality. Mortality risk is influenced by interactions of alcohol with other environmental and genetic factors and temporal periods of susceptibility. In this paper we discuss four time periods (preconceptual, gestational, infancy, and childhood) where alcohol use may create a context of risk. Alcohol use in one period increases the risk of alcohol use in subsequent periods. Gestational alcohol use can influence risk of mortality from abuse of mother/fetus, can cause other adverse outcomes, and can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In infancy alcohol use can increase risk from impairment of arousal in adults who use alcohol. Infants with gestational exposure can be behaviorally difficult with sleep disturbance, irritability, and colic. This can increase the risk of harm or death, especially during periods of caretakers' alcohol use. Caretakers' alcohol use and smoking are strongly correlated. The all-cause mortality rate in people diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is over 5%. All-cause mortality in siblings of diagnosed cases of FAS is increased 530% compared to siblings of matched controls. We recommend that a context of alcohol use be considered as a marker for multifactorial risk in all fetal, infant, and child deaths. A schema to collect data on alcohol use is provided to increase awareness of alcohol use as an environmental risk marker for mortality. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common identifiable teratogenic cause of mental retardation, neurological deficit, mental disorders, and developmental disabilities. Accurate estimates of the cost of care for persons with FAS are essential for appropriate funding of health care, developmental disabilities services, special education, and other service systems, as well as prioritizing funding of public health prevention efforts. The cost of care for individuals with FAS can be conceptualized as the annual cost of care for one person or a population, or as the lifetime cost of care for an individual. Annual cost estimates for the United States range from $75 million in 1984 to $4.0 billion in 1998. Estimates of lifetime cost vary from $596,000 in 1980 to $1.4 million in 1988. After adjustments for changes in inflation and population, 2002 estimates of total annual cost and lifetime cost are higher. FAS is increasingly being recognized as a large public health problem with high potential for the prevention of future cases and for the prevention of excess disability and premature mortality in persons who are affected. Each day, from 6-22 infants with FAS are born in the United States, and as many as 87-103 more are born with other impairments resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Updated and improved cost data on FAS should be a research priority. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Heavy alcohol exposure can have serious and long-lasting effects on the developing fetal brain. In the last decade, researchers have utilized quantitative structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the brains of living children and adults with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. In addition to microcephaly, these studies indicated structural abnormalities in various regions of the brain, including the cerebellum, corpus callosum, and the basal ganglia. Most recently, we have utilized novel imaging and analytic techniques to study the brain as a whole in an effort to elucidate more subtle differences than was possible with earlier techniques. Results indicated displacements in the corpus callosum, increased gray matter densities in both hemispheres in the perisylvian regions, and altered gray matter asymmetry in portions of the temporal lobes in the brains of alcohol-exposed subjects. In addition, prominent shape abnormalities were observed in the brains of these subjects, with narrowing in the temporal region and reduced brain growth in portions of the frontal lobe. These results imply that brain growth continues to be adversely affected long after the prenatal insult and that the brain regions most affected may be consistent with the neurocognitive deficits characteristic of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - An Analysis of the Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure on Growth: A Teratologic Model
A1  - Day N.L.
A1  - Richardson G.A.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The association between prenatal exposure to alcohol and growth is linear, and effects have been measured at levels of exposure that are considerably below one drink per day. Thus, with respect to growth deficits, there is no safe level of drinking during pregnancy. Alcohol exposure during gestation causes growth deficits among the offspring at birth and during infancy. At older ages, however, growth deficits are reported in some, though not all, studies. Exposed offspring who grow up in more privileged environments are apparently able to make up their growth deficits, while those raised in less optimal circumstances do not. This means that there is an interaction between the environment in which a child is raised and the expression of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. The long-term implications of growth deficits are not yet well understood. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Recognition of Facial Features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in the Newborn

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The diagnosis of an infant, especially a newborn, with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is difficult due to the fact that not all of the features are apparent at that time. Many cases are also missed due to inadequate knowledge of the mother's drinking pattern and because of the examining physician's lack of experience with the disorder. While conducting a study of the use of maternal blood markers to determine alcohol use in pregnancy, we have evaluated systematically the effects of alcohol on the newborn infant. We have developed a facial scoring system consisting of six of the features commonly seen in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and present preliminary data about its use. By using a cutoff of four or more of these six features, there is a significant correlation with the presence of these features and the mother's self-reported alcohol use. In addition, there has been no significant difference in the frequency of positive scores between newborns of Caucasian or Black ancestry. We propose that this system may be useful in the assessment of newborn infants at high risk because of alcohol exposure during pregnancy. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Data were obtained from three samples of women of childbearing age. One sample of women is from prenatal clinics serving Plains Indian women. The second sample is of women from the Plains whose children were referred to special diagnostic developmental clinics, as their children were believed to have developmental issues consistent with prenatal alcohol consumption. The third sample is of women from South Africa, each of whom has given birth to a child diagnosed with full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Data across samples conform to expected trends on many variables. For example, the maternal age at time of pregnancy, a major risk factor for FAS, ranged from a mean of 23.5 years for the prenatal clinic sample, to 23.8 years for the developmental clinic sample, to 27.6 for the sample of women who have delivered children with FAS. Other variables of maternal risk for FAS expected from the extant literature, such as high gravidity and parity, binge drinking, heavy intergenerational drinking in the mother's extended family and immediate social network, and length of drinking career, were compared across the three samples with variable results. However, normative measures of drinking problems are unreliable when reported across cultures. An unexpected finding from this three-sample comparison was the differential risk found when comparing U.S. women to South African women. Women in the U.S. Plains Indian samples report a high consumption of alcohol in a binge pattern of drinking, yet there is less detectable damage to the fetus than among the South African women. Body mass index (BMI) and lifelong and current nutrition may have a substantial impact, along with the above factors, in relative risk for an FAS birth. The level of risk for producing a child with FAS is influenced by environmental and behavioral conditions that vary between populations and among individual women. Also, because many syndromes are genetically based, there is a need for full behavioral and genetic histories of the mother, family, and child being studied. Collecting extensive behavioral information as well as genetic histories will provide the requisite information for making an accurate diagnosis of FAS. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy is a leading, preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States, with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) being one of the most severe outcomes. Current survey statistics find that approximately one in eight pregnant women (500,000 per year) report alcohol use, with approximately 80,000 reporting binge drinking. While annual rates have fluctuated, trends analysis finds that there has been no significant change in rates of prenatal alcohol exposure over the past 10-year period. Development of effective programs to prevent FAS and to monitor the success of prevention efforts requires epidemiological data systems to inform these activities. This article describes alcohol use patterns among childbearing-age women and data sources that can be used in monitoring this behavior.

N2  - The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a "Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health Disparities 2002: A Call to Arms," on December 5, 2002, in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. This workshop was part of the NIAAA/NIH comprehensive strategic plan to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities. Eleven topics were addressed: (1) biomedical risk factors that may contribute to disparities in the toxic effects of alcohol; (2) alcohol and gene-environment interactions that affect the health of diverse groups; (3) alcohol pharmacogenetics in Mexican-Americans; (4) determinants of risk for alcoholism in minority populations; (5) consideration of population groups in linkage-disequilibrium studies to identify genes associated with alcohol dependence; (6) interaction between alcohol dependence and African-American ethnicity in disordered sleep, nocturnal cytokines, and immunity; (7) disparities of brain functional reserve capacity affecting brain morbidity related to substance abuse; (8) alcohol and pregnancy disparities; (9) role of alcohol in cancer risk disparities; (10) ethnic diversity in alcoholic cardiomyopathy; and (11) postmenopausal health disparities. On the basis of these presentations, seven conclusions emerged: (1) Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes exist in various populations. (2) These enzymes play a role in the variation in health effect outcomes seen in different populations, owing to alcohol consumption. (3) Differences between and among population groups can be critically important for the design and interpretation of studies in genetics. These include differences in expression of phenotype, in locus heterogeneity, in risk alleles, and in population structure. (4) Incidence rates for fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are greater in African-Americans and Native-Americans than in Caucasians. Genetic polymorphisms, nutrition, and other factors may account for these differences. (5) The highest mortality rate for cirrhosis has been found in white Hispanic men. (6) Mexican-Americans have a low frequency of the protective alleles ADH1B*2 and ALDH2*2 and a relatively high frequency of CYP2E1 c2, which is associated with early onset alcoholism. (7) The incidence rate for cancer is greater for African-Americans than for Caucasians, and part of the higher risk may be attributed to heavier drinking. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Maternal prenatal alcohol use is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities. On the severe end of the spectrum of conditions related to drinking during pregnancy is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Physicians and other health practitioners play a critical role in diagnosing FAS and in screening women of childbearing age for alcohol use during pregnancy. The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Team at CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities awarded funds to four medical school partners (Meharry and Morehouse Medical Colleges, St. Louis University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and the University of California at Los Angeles) to develop FAS regional training centers (RTCs). The RTCs are developing, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating educational curricula for medical and allied health students and practitioners that incorporate evidence-based diagnostic guidelines for FAS and other prenatal alcohol-related disorders. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background: This study investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on learning and memory in 14-year-old adolescents. The Children's Memory Scale was used to assess learning and memory function in the verbal/auditory and visual/spatial domains. In addition, both short- and long-term memory function were assessed. Methods: Data were collected as part of the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project, a longitudinal study including 580 children and their mothers. Women were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy and with their children from birth to 16 years of age. At age 14, memory function was evaluated using the Children's Memory Scale, an assessment tool that measures learning and immediate and delayed memory function in the verbal and visual-spatial domains. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure during the first trimester predicted deficits in learning, short-term memory, and long-term memory, specifically in the verbal domain. Deficits in performance were specific to learning and memory of word-pairs. In addition, deficits in memory were mediated by learning performance. Conclusions: Results demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure lead to deficits in encoding processes as indicated by deficits in verbal learning. Initial deficits in acquisition were responsible for deficits in immediate and delayed recall of verbal information in children who were exposed to alcohol during pregnancy but did not have fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - The Impact of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure on Neurophysiological Encoding of Environmental Events at Six Months
A1  - Kable J.A.
A1  - Coles C.D.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Using methodologies from developmental studies on infant information-processing skills, early manifestations of later long-term neurocognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure can be explored by assessing primary cognitive processes, including attentional regulation and processing speed. Methods: One hundred eighteen 6-month-old infants (18 high risk, 100 low risk) from a longitudinal study of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and intrauterine growth retardation were presented with both auditory (400 and 1000 Hz pure tones) and visual stimuli (chromatic Caucasian faces) in an information-processing paradigm with cardiac response as the dependent variable. The first three habituation trials were analyzed to assess neurophysiological encoding of environmental events in infants categorized as high and low risk based on status of maternal drinking. Specific indexes of the cardiac response were used to assess the infant's (1) speed of initiating attention, (2) sustained attention, and (3) shifting attention after stimulus offset. Results: Infants identified as high risk based on a cumulative risk index for prenatal alcohol exposure responded more slowly to stimuli and were rated as significantly higher in arousal level across the three trials but did not display differences in their sustained deceleration responses or responses to stimulus-offset. Conclusions: Less efficient neurophysiological encoding was observed among high-risk infants, suggesting that prenatal alcohol exposure may disrupt fundamental components of the attentional system responsible for regulating the body's responses to environmental events. Slower neurophysiological responses involved in encoding environmental stimuli and initiating attention and higher levels of behavioral arousal suggest that these infants may have had difficulties with regulating the interactions between arousal level and the attentional system needed to provide optimal efficiency in processing environmental events. These outcomes suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure results in specific impairments in early attentional regulation, which may influence subsequent cognitive development and behavioral outcomes dependent on these primary cognitive processes.

N2  - Objective: We performed a longitudinal study of nerve conduction velocity to determine the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the peripheral nervous system. Study design: We studied 17 children exposed to >2 oz of absolute alcohol/day prenatally and 13 unexposed children, identified prospectively from a cohort of pregnant women screened during prenatal care. Nerve conduction assessment was done on the median, ulnar, peroneal and tibial nerves during the newborn period and between 12 and 14 months of age. Results: At both assessments the alcohol-exposed subjects had significantly slower ulnar motor nerve velocity (P = .007), smaller proximal (P = .018) and distal amplitude (P = .051). They also showed reduced tibial nerve velocity (P = .06) and a decrease in distal amplitude. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with abnormalities in nerve electrical properties, and that the pattern is different from that seen in adults. Electrophysiologic abnormalities in peripheral nerves should be added to the problems found in children of alcohol abusing mothers.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: Diagnosis, epidemiology, and developmental outcomes
A1  - O'Leary C.M.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - In Australia the issue of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has not been the subject of policy development or of extensive research. There is a lack of knowledge, both in the general community and by health professionals, of the nature of the risks associated with heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the factors that increase this risk. This paper reviews the literature surrounding FAS with the aim of providing the reader an understanding of the diagnostic features and epidemiology of FAS and of the developmental sequelae associated with this syndrome.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt brain development, leading to a variety of behavioral alterations including learning deficits, hyperactivity, and motor dysfunction. We have been investigating the possibility that perinatal choline supplementation may effectively reduce the severity of alcohol's adverse effects on behavioral development. We previously reported that perinatal choline supplementation can ameliorate alcohol-induced learning deficits and hyperactivity in rats exposed to alcohol during development. The present study examined whether perinatal choline supplementation could also reduce the severity of motor deficits induced by alcohol exposure during the third trimester equivalent brain growth spurt. Male neonatal rats were assigned to one of three treatment groups. One group was exposed to alcohol (6.6 g/kg/day) from postnatal days (PD) 4 to 9 via an artificial rearing procedure. Artificially and normally reared control groups were included. One half of subjects from each treatment received daily subcutaneous injections of a choline chloride solution from PD 4 to 30, whereas the other half received saline vehicle injections. On PD 35-37, subjects were tested on a parallel bar motor task, which requires both balance and fine motor coordination. Ethanol-exposed subjects exhibited significant motor impairments compared to both control groups whose performance did not differ significantly from one another. Perinatal choline treatment did not affect motor performance in either ethanol or control subjects. These data indicate that the beneficial effects of perinatal choline supplementation in ethanol-treated subjects are task specific and suggest that choline is more effective in mitigating cognitive deficits compared to motor deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Health care providers can more effectively prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and prenatal alcohol exposure if they know more about mothers who have children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or some characteristics of FAS. METHODS: We conducted two retrospective case-control studies of Northern Plains Indian children with FAS and some characteristics of FAS diagnosed from 1981 to 1993 by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71. We compared mothers who had children with FAS or some characteristics of FAS with mothers who had children that did not have FAS. RESULTS: Compared with control mothers, 43 mothers who had children with FAS and 35 mothers who had children with some characteristics of FAS were older, had fewer prenatal visits, more pregnancies, more mental health problems, and more injuries (both total and alcohol-related). Although the prevalence of drinking was high in both case and control mothers, case mothers had more alcohol-related medical problems, drank heavily, in binges, and daily more often than control mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Women with injuries and mental health problems should be screened for substance use. Mothers of children with FAS or of some characteristics of FAS have numerous needs that must be addressed to prevent future prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Because alcohol is a known teratogenic substance that negatively affects the fetus, screening for alcohol use is included in maternal child texts for nurses. They present no standard screening approach, however. In the general literature, a multitude of screening instruments exist for the purpose of detecting maternal alcohol dependence but few allow the nurse to detect fetal alcohol exposure in the absence of maternal alcohol dependence. After a comparative analysis of existing screening instruments, we concluded that the Timeline Followback method has the most utility as a screening instrument to detect fetal exposure to alcohol. The purpose of this article is to present a critical review of current screening instruments related to alcohol consumption in pregnant women and to propose the use of the Timeline Followback method as the preferred approach.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome--South Africa, 2001
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities. The FAS phenotype is characterized by a combination of facial dysmorphic features, growth retardation, and central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. State-based estimates of the prevalence of FAS in the United States vary from 0.3 to 1.5 per 1,000 live-born infants. Recently, the highest prevalence of FAS worldwide was reported among first-grade children in a wine-growing region in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Investigators for the National Institutes of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) reported a FAS prevalence of 40.5 to 46.4 per 1,000 children aged 5-9 years in one community in Western Cape. To determine whether FAS was associated exclusively with the wine-growing region in Western Cape or was more endemic in other areas of the country, CDC, in collaboration with the University of Witwatersrand and the Foundation for Alcohol Related Research in Johannesburg, South Africa, conducted a prevalence study in Gauteng province and is developing ongoing surveillance and prevention activities. This report summarizes the findings of the study, which indicate a high prevalence of FAS among first-grade children in four nonwine-growing communities around Johannesburg. Because South Africa has limited resources and many competing health problems (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases), integrating prenatal alcohol-exposure prevention activities with existing prevention programs should be explored.

T1  - Motivational intervention to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies--Florida, Texas, and Virginia, 1997-2001
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol use is a threat to healthy pregnancy outcomes for many U.S. women. During 1999, approximately 500,000 pregnant women reported having one or more drinks during the preceding month, and approximately 130,000 reported having seven or more alcohol drinks per week or engaging in binge drinking (i.e., five or more drinks in a day). These heavier drinking patterns have been associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (ARND). Lower levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., fewer than seven drinks per week) also have been associated with measurable effects on children's development and behavior. Although the majority of women reduce their alcohol use substantially when they realize they are pregnant, a large proportion do not realize they are pregnant until well into the first trimester and, therefore, might continue to drink alcohol during this critical period of fetal development. To reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies, CDC initiated a multisite pilot study (phase I clinical trial) in 1997 to investigate the use of a dual intervention focused on both alcohol-use reduction and effective contraception among childbearing-aged women at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (Project CHOICES). This report describes the association between baseline drinking measures and the success women have achieved in reducing their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The analysis compares the impact of the motivational intervention at 6-month follow-up on women drinking at high-, medium-, and low-risk drinking levels. The findings indicate that although 69% of the women in the study reduced their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, women with the lowest baseline drinking measures achieved the highest rates of outcome success, primarily by choosing effective contraception and, secondarily, by reducing alcohol use. Women with higher baseline drinking measures chose both approaches equally but achieved lower success rates for reducing their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial of the motivational intervention is under way to further investigate outcomes of the phase I study.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an integrated review of the literature on fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), focusing on the definition of FAS/FAE, their incidence and related problems, gestational research findings, FAS symptoms, the effects of prenatal alcohol consumption on offspring over time, and FAS/FAE preventive measures. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches of MEDLINE and Web sites, as well as reference lists from published articles on FAS/FAE from 1973 to present. STUDY SELECTION: Literature was chosen from refereed journals and from current publications of the National Organization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using keywords relevant to FAS and FAS prevention. DATA SYNTHESIS: The consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can harm the fetus irreparably. Preventive measures can be helpful in decreasing or stopping the use of alcohol during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol is a definite teratogen. The amount of alcohol, if any, that can be safely consumed during pregnancy, the exact physiological mechanisms that make alcohol unsafe for the fetus, and the most effective prevention measures have yet to be identified. FAS/FAE is still increasing in the United States.

N2  - Background: Health care providers can more effectively prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and prenatal alcohol exposure if they know more about mothers who have children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or some characteristics of FAS. Methods: We conducted two retrospective case-control studies of Northern Plains Indian children with FAS and some characteristics of FAS diagnosed from 1981 to 1993 by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71. We compared mothers who had children with FAS or some characteristics of FAS with mothers who had children that did not have FAS. Results: Compared with control mothers, 43 mothers who had children with FAS and 35 mothers who had children with some characteristics of FAS were older, had fewer prenatal visits, more pregnancies, more mental health problems, and more injuries (both total and alcohol-related). Although the prevalence of drinking was high in both case and control mothers, case mothers had more alcohol-related medical problems, drank heavily, in binges, and daily more often than control mothers. Conclusions: Women with injuries and mental health problems should be screened for substance use. Mothers of children with FAS or of some characteristics of FAS have numerous needs that must be addressed to prevent future prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Alcohol Use in Pregnant Low-Income Women

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Objective: The present study had two aims: (1) to examine the prevalence rates of prenatal alcohol consumption in a group of women participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in Southern California, with special emphasis on Hispanic women, and (2) to identify variables associated with postconception drinking in low-income minority women. Method: The study employed a cross-sectional survey that assessed alcohol use rates, demographic variables, and alcohol risk status. Participants were 826 pregnant women enrolled in the Public Health Foundation Enterprises (PHFE) WIC Program in Los Angeles and Orange counties, California. Pregnant women who enrolled self-administered a specially designed alcohol screener. Results: Findings were that 24% of sample women were consuming alcohol post conception. Of that percentage, approximately two thirds drank prior to pregnancy recognition, and one third continued to drink after pregnancy was confirmed. Approximately 30% of white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic and English-speaking Hispanic women were found to drink post conception compared with 15.8% of Spanish-speaking Hispanic women. This finding supported recent research that suggests more acculturated Hispanic women tend to incorporate the drinking patterns of the larger U.S. population to a greater extent than less acculturated Hispanic women. Although a number of demographic variables differentiated women who were abstinent from those who were postconception drinkers, the best predictor of postconception alcohol consumption was the woman's high-risk drinking score as measured by the TWEAK (sensitivity = 70.1%, specificity = 88.5%). Conclusions: Results suggest the importance of screening low-income minority pregnant women in a community setting so that interventions can be initiated to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and related conditions.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and ADHD: Diagnostic implications and therapeutic consequences
A1  - O'Malley K.D.
A1  - Storoz L.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The first association between prenatal alcohol exposure and a teratogenic effect in the developing fetus was made in 1968 by pediatrician Paul Lemoine in France. A few years later, Jones and Smith defined the fetal alcohol syndrome which combined dysmorphic facial, growth and CNS features. The classic fetal alcohol syndrome has been recently reviewed. Current research is beginning to acknowledge that exposure to differing levels of prenatal alcohol cause a spectrum of clinical conditions which can be grouped under the umbrella term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. There are three subtypes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: full fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome (where there is only partial facial dysmorphology) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (where there is no facial dysmorphology and often absence of growth features). The term alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder is gradually replacing the older term fetal alcohol effects. These subtypes were initially described by Stratton and colleagues in 1996. It is also becoming clearer that the full fetal alcohol syndrome as originally described by Jones and Smith, and diagnosed in dysmorphic clinics, is the least common clinical subtype resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. In addition, current and ongoing research on brain structure, shape and function indicates that the brain abnormality is not correlated with the facial dysmorphology or intelligence quotient. Therefore, the presence of full fetal alcohol syndrome does not necessarily mean that the patient has the most severe CNS impairments. Genetic research has suggested that genetic factors may have a role in a modulating a woman's susceptibility to having a baby with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (specifically the full fetal alcohol syndrome subtype). Thus, genetic factors may increase the variability of the teratogenic effect of prenatal exposure to alcohol on the developing fetus.

T1  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on infant mental development: A meta-analytical review

A1  - Das Eiden R.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Aims: Although research on fetal alcohol exposure has had a significant effect on social norms and public policy, there has been little quantitative review of this literature. Methods: Meta-analysis was used to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on infant mental development, assessed using the Mental Development Index (MDI) from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, a widely used, standardized measure. The current study examined the effects of three levels of average daily exposure during pregnancy: less than 1 drink per day, 1-1.99 drinks per day and 2 or more drinks per day. Analyses were conducted separately for effects derived from observations of 6-8-, 12-13- and 18-26-month-old children. Results: Fetal alcohol exposure at all three dosage levels was associated with significantly lower MDI scores among 12-13-month-olds. The effect was attenuated, but not eliminated, when effect sizes adjusted for relevant covariates were used. For younger and older children, the effect of fetal alcohol exposure did not attain statistical significance at any dosage level. Conclusions: This pattern of results may reflect differences in MDI item content at different ages and the differential sensitivity of these abilities to prenatal alcohol exposure. Because the body of relevant literature is neither large nor conclusive, and because of heterogeneity in measurement, analysis and samples, caution is urged in interpreting results. Future research would benefit from use of more specific measures of infant outcomes and consideration of the impact of relevant covariates, different dosage patterns and timing of drinking on infant mental development.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The aims of the study were, first, to perform a comprehensive assessment of neurocognitive status in early adolescence of children exposed to alcohol prenatally; and, second, to examine whether duration of exposure continues to be predictive of outcome at this age. Twenty-seven exposed 12-14-year-olds and 39 non-exposed 13-14-year-olds underwent neuropsychological assessments (WISC-III, NEPSY subtests) of attention and executive functions, language, visuomotor functions, and memory. The group of non-exposed children was used to develop preliminary test norms for the 13-14-year-old exposed children whereas published test norms could be used for the 12-year-olds. The results demonstrated neurocognitive impairment across all types of tasks. Impairment varied in degree according to the duration of alcohol exposure. Children exposed throughout pregnancy, most of who had diagnoses of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) or Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE), performed well below the average range. It was concluded that the neurocognitive effects of alcohol exposure tend to be widespread and generalized. Attention and executive functions do not seem to be selectively affected. Further, the relationship between duration of prenatal alcohol exposure and neurocognitive development continues to be significant in early adolescence.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - We employed a computerized (virtual) Morris water task (VMWT) to measure place learning and cued-navigation in eight adolescent males (9.5-16.5 years old) diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Eight adolescent males matched for age and ethnicity with no history of prenatal alcohol exposure served as controls. Participants were trained to navigate to a hidden platform in a fixed location relative to a set of four conspicuous extramaze cues. After 20 hidden platform trials, a single no-platform probe trial was conducted, followed by 8 trials during which the platform was visible (cued-navigation). The FAS group traveled further than controls to navigate to the hidden platform during training. During the probe trial, controls navigated more directly to the platform region and persisted in searching where the platform had been more than the FAS group. Cued-navigation was comparable in both groups, suggesting that group differences in place learning were not attributable to visual-motor or motivational deficits in the FAS subjects. This pattern of impaired place learning and spared cued-navigation is similar to that reported in rats exposed to ethanol during periods of prenatal or early postnatal brain growth, as well as in animals with hippocampal damage. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

T1  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on glucose tolerance in the rat offspring
A1  - Chen L.
A1  - Gregoire Nyomba B.L.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Low birth weight in humans predisposes to obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes in adult life. Alcohol exposure during pregnancy has been associated with fetal growth restriction. We investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol on glucose metabolism later in the offspring. Female Sprague Dawley rats were given ethanol (ETOH), 4 g/kg/day by gavage throughout pregnancy. Compared with controls, newborn ETOH rats had decreased body size (5.1 +/- 0.1 v 6.3 +/- 0.1 g, P < .001), plasma insulin (0.44 +/- 0.4 v O.67 +/- 0.1 ng/mL, P < .05), and leptin mRNA (P < .05), but they had normal beta-cell mass and elevated adipose resistin mRNA and plasma glucose (5.0 +/- 0.5 v 3.6 +/- 0.3 mmol/L, P < .01). Food intake was decreased in ETOH rats during the fourth week of life, and body weight remained decreased compared with controls until a catch-up growth occurred by 7 weeks of life. At 13 weeks of age, body weight and beta-cell mass of ETOH offspring were normal, but plasma glucose and insulin after a glucose challenge were increased compared with controls (P < .05). Adipose leptin and hypothalamic Ob-R mRNA were not different from controls, but resistin was increased (P < .05), and muscle GLUT4 content was decreased (P < .05) in ETOH offspring compared with controls. The data suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure impairs glucose tolerance in the offspring by both inducing insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. The prevailing mechanism in 3-month-old rat offspring appears to be insulin resistance, manifested by glucose intolerance and decreased GLUT4 despite hyperinsulinemia. Copyright 2003 Elsevier, Inc.

T1  - Prenatal ethanol exposure alters the responsiveness of the rat hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to nitric oxide
A1  - Lee S.
A1  - Blanton C.A.
A1  - Rivier C.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to cause hyperactivity of the mature offspring's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We have recently shown that hypothalamic neurons that produce corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), the peptide that represents the major adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) secretagogue, display increased responses to various stimuli in prenatal alcohol-exposed (E), compared to control (C) rats. CRF-producing perikarya are regulated, in part, by nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule whose function is also modified by prenatal alcohol exposure. The present investigation was therefore undertaken to test the hypothesis that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with alterations in NO-stimulated ACTH secretion. Methods: Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to alcohol in utero were injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) with the vehicle or the NO donor 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1; 20 or 50 mug). ACTH levels were measured in blood samples collected from indwelling jugular cannulae at 15, 30 and 45 min following injection. Brains were obtained 45 and 90 min after SIN-1 injection and processed for in situ hybridization. Results: Compared to males, both C and E females exhibited a significantly (p < 0.01) larger ACTH response to SIN-1 (20 mug). Prenatal alcohol treatment enhanced SIN-1-induced ACTH release in all E animals, but this difference only reached statistical significance (p < 0.01) in males. This prenatal influence was also observed in the significantly (p < 0.01) larger SIN-1-induced increase in transcripts for the immediate early gene nerve growth factor induced protein B (NGFI-B) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the males', but not females' hypothalamus. Conclusions: The ability of increased brain NO levels to release ACTH and stimulate PVN neuronal activity is enhanced in adult male rats exposed to alcohol prenatally. These data support the hypothesis that alterations in HPA axis activity in adult offspring of alcohol-exposed dams may be related to changes in hypothalamic responsiveness to NO.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) display altered performance in tasks of learning and memory, behaviours thought to be associated with the hippocampus. Altered hippocampal structure has been reported in some FAS children; therefore, a rat model system was used to determine whether the size and numbers of pyramidal cells in regions CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampal formation and granule cells in the dentate gyrus were altered by alcohol exposure during different periods of development. Rat pups were exposed to alcohol in utero during the second trimester-equivalent (E10-20), the first two trimesters-equivalent (E1-20), during the time of hippocampal pyramidal cell neurogenesis (E16-20), part of the third trimester-equivalent (P4-9), and all three trimesters-equivalent (E1-20+P4-9). Control animals (nutritional and untreated) were reared for all treatment conditions. All pups were perfused on P10. CA1 volume, pyramidal cell density, and number were reduced in pups treated with alcohol during the third trimester-equivalent, whether unique or as exposure during all three trimesters-equivalent. CA3 volume was reduced in alcohol-treated animals across all gestational ages; however, pyramidal cell density and number in this region were only reduced in animals treated with alcohol during the third trimester-equivalent. Volume of the dentate gyrus did not appear to be affected by alcohol treatment. Granule cell density and number in this region were reduced in animals treated with alcohol during the third trimester-equivalent. The third trimester-equivalent in the rat appears to be a developmental period during which the hippocampus is particularly susceptible to the effects of alcohol consumption. The resulting damage to the hippocampus may contribute to the behavioural deficits related to learning and memory noted in children with FAS. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Plasma testosterone (T) was measured in control male and female rats on gestational days 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 and on days 17-20 in males from dams who were fed ethanol and/or were stressed during pregnancy. Circulating T in control males showed an earlier rise, yielding a longer period of prenatal T elevation, than was reported previously (Endocrinology 106 (1980)306). Compared to control males, exposure to alcohol-alone augmented T on days 18 and 19, stress-alone attenuated prenatal T, and the combination of stress and alcohol completely blocked the normal rise in T between days 17 and 18. When these prenatal alterations in T are viewed along with effects these same treatments have on the postparturient T surge (Horm. Behav. 41 (2002) 229), a possible explanatory mechanism emerges for the uniquely different behavioral patterns of sexual behavior differentiation induced in males by prenatal exposure to alcohol, stress, or both factors. Whereas the potential for feminine behavior is retained to the extent that either the prenatal or the neonatal T surge is attenuated, the male potential is more sensitive to reductions in the fetal surge and is maximally disrupted if both the prenatal and the postparturitional T surges are suppressed. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

N2  - Background and Objective: The fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is considered as the main preventable cause of congenital defects and mental deficiency. We analyzed whether the consumption of alcohol during gestation has changed in Spain. Subjects and Method: We analyzed the evolution over the last 24 years, as well as the geographical distribution according to Spanish regions, of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. We used data from the ECEMC, a registry which includes 1,820,862 liveborns, of whom 30,836 were malformed. A similar number of healthy controls was collected. We established 5 increasing levels of alcohol consumption, for sporadic and diary intakes, and 3 levels of maternal scholarship. Results: Except for the lowest and highest intakes, alcohol consumption levels showed a decreasing trend over the time. These tendencies were similar in almost all Spanish regions. When comparing the intake between regions, the differences were statistically significant. There was a correlation between the maternal scholarship and the alcohol intake, showing that the higher the education the lower the amount of alcohol consumption. Conclusions: The awareness of the alcohol effects is related to the maternal cultural level. Maternal consumption of alcohol varies across Spanish regions, though its trends are similar.

N2  - Background: Although the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) varies within the population, few data are available concerning variation in the prevalence of prenatal drinking. Methods: Postpartum women delivering singleton infants at two Atlanta hospitals in 1993 or 1994 were interviewed. Those delivering infants who were small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 638) were over-sampled relative to those delivering infants with birth weights that were appropriate for gestational age (AGA) (n = 247). The prevalence of prenatal drinking was estimated as a weighted average of reports from mothers of SGA and AGA infants. Estimates of the prevalence of FAS come from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: The prevalence of first-trimester drinking was half that reported for the three previous months (private hospital: 72% vs. 35%; public hospital: 52% vs. 28%). Most women (85%) reported abstaining throughout the second trimester. Fewer than 10% of women delivering at the public hospital (7.5%), but one-quarter of those delivering at the private hospital, reported third-trimester drinking. Binge, moderate and heavy drinking in pregnancy were more common among women delivering at the public hospital. Eight infants born at the public hospital during this period, but none of those born at the private hospital, were identified as possibly having FAS; four of the eight were identified as probably having FAS. Conclusions: These results have implications for health education programs. For example, obstetricians in private practice may wish to reaffirm their advice to abstain from drinking in the third trimester. They also suggest that prenatal abstinence programs be targeted at populations identified as most likely to engage in risky drinking.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a major public health issue that is evident on an international scale. The current article summarizes a meeting that was held in Valencia, Spain, in September 2001, that reviewed ongoing international collaborations and the prospects for new collaborative research. The attendees represented nine different countries and many different specialties. Following overviews of existing international collaborations in South Africa, Russia, and Chile, a number of topics for future work were discussed. Issues related to the diagnosis of FAS, its prevalence and how measures might be enhanced and standardized were presented, as obtaining consistency across populations is of prime importance. Another session discussed the current state of basic research and how collaborations in this area might be initiated. The neurobehavioral profile of FAS and how work in this area could be advanced and interpreted in light of findings with different populations generated considerable discussion. There was a review of brain imaging data in FAS and how this might be utilized in assisting the diagnosis of FAS and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). A presentation on the utilization of international collaborations in defining the role of genetics in the etiology of FAS was included. Finally, issues related to the prevention of FAS and how these issues might be modified based upon different populations were presented. International collaborations provide a wealth of resources for the study of FAS, and it was hoped that this meeting might better enhance the work ongoing in this area, and provide opportunities for future work.

T1  - Biochemical markers of alcohol use in pregnant women
A1  - Cook J.D.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Objectives. To describe the serious health consequences of alcohol (ethanol) use, especially as they relate to pregnancy and the development of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE). The classic markers of alcohol exposure, including blood/breath alcohol, -glutamyl transferase (GT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hemoglobin-associated acetaldehyde (HAA) and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), are valuable and their methods of analysis are reviewed. Conclusions. Since both FAS and FAE represent two of the leading preventable causes of mental retardation and birth defects, identification of alcohol use early in pregnancy is important to avoid adverse fetal outcomes. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of FAS and FAE is usually made after birth, when alcohol damage has become irreversible and permanent. The clinical laboratory can help prevent this damage and make a valuable contribution in assessing prenatal alcohol use. The clinical utility of blood/breath alcohol, GT, MCV, HAA and CDT in alcohol use identification, especially in pregnancy, is substantial. Although none of the markers singularly has adequate sensitivity and specificity for screening, their diagnostic utility increases when measured as a panel. This is especially true in detecting alcohol use in pregnancy where the presence of several positive markers was correlated with the presence of alcohol-related fetal effects. © 2002 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Verbal Learning deficits have been reported following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). This study examined verbal and visual multitrial learning in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) and controls matched on age and gender from the same community. In this study, the FAS/FAE group's immediate memory on the Verbal Learning and Visual Learning tasks from the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML) was significantly weaker than that of the control group. Although the FAS/FAE group also recalled significantly less information after a delay, they did retain an equivalent proportion of the visual and verbal information as compared to the control group. Thus, the overall pattern of performance on both verbal and visual measures was consistent with that observed in previous studies of Verbal Learning: despite weaker learning, the FAS/FAE group's relative retention of information was no different than that of controls. © 2002 National Academy of Neuropsychology.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), and alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorders (ARNDs) in neonates are often the result of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Facial characteristics are associated with FAS, but ARBDs and ARNDs are more difficult to diagnose. Fetal exposure to alcohol can cause central nervous system dysfunction, pre- and postnatal growth problems, cardiac defects in neonates, and attention deficit disorders and mental retardation in older children. To date, diagnosis of fetal alcohol effect has depended largely on maternal interview, although clinical tests are becoming more widely used. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are formed in the body by esterification of ethanol with free fatty acids and trans-esterification of glycerides and have been detected in the meconium of newborns. This report estimates the prevalence of fetal alcohol exposure in two populations by detecting FAEEs in meconium. Methods: We analyzed the prevalence of FAEEs in the meconium of two separate groups of neonates by use of solid-phase extraction and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the chemical ionization mode. In the first study, meconium samples were taken anonymously from babies born in a large, regional perinatal center in Hawaii. In the second study, specimens were obtained from infants admitted to six different newborn intensive care units within the state of Utah. Results: In the first study, 73 of 436 (16.7%) meconium specimens tested were considered positive for FAEEs. When broken down into quartiles, the mean total FAEEs measured were 1059, 3133, 6628, and 62115 ng/g. In the second study, 35 of 289 (12.1%) specimens were considered positive. When broken into quartiles, the mean total FAEEs were 1139, 3067, 7674, and 50 143 ng/g. The overall FAEE profiles of the two study sets were remarkably similar. Conclusion: In an adequate meconium specimen, a total FAEE concentration >10 000 ng/g may indicate that the newborn has been exposed to significant amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. © 2003 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

N2  - A description of an ongoing program for the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs) is provided. The prevention program focuses on women with increased risk factors. Paraprofessionals were added to selected professional case management teams in Montana in both rural and urban settings. The pilot program is linked with existing public health programs that are in place to help decrease the mortality of infants in Montana. A quasi-experimental design is being utilized to determine the efficacy of the prevention program in reducing risk factors that lead to alcohol use during pregnancy. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure is an important cause of growth impairment. In this study we examined the stability of the growth measurements, including height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) percentiles, from birth to age at the time of diagnosis for subjects who were referred for evaluation to determine if they had fetal alcohol syndrome. Methods: We utilized subjects from the North Dakota Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Registry. Each person referred for assessment was provided a standardized assessment completed by a medical geneticist. We also examined differences in the diagnostic schema from the Institute of Medicine. The population consisted of 315 subjects with paired weight measurements, 234 subjects with paired height measurements, and 322 subjects with current BMI measurements. Results: Increases in weight percentiles and decreases in height percentiles were found. Children with FAS had consistently lower growth measurements. There was significant movement in and out of lower 5th and 10th percentiles by partial and no FAS children from birth to diagnosis. Discussion: The requirement for growth impairment needs to be broad rather than narrow, if most subjects with a diagnosis of FAS and partial FAS/ARND are to be captured. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common cause of developmental disability, neuropsychiatric impairment and birth defects. The disorder is identified by the presence of growth impairment, central nervous system dysfunction, and a characteristic pattern of craniofacial features. The reported prevalence of the disorder varies widely and recent estimates approach 1% of live births. Expression of these features varies by age. People with FAS have high rates of comorbid conditions: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (40%), mental retardation (15-20%), learning disorders (25%), speech and language disorders (30%), sensory impairment (30%), cerebral palsy (4%), epilepsy (8-10%). Birth defects are common. In the United States, the annual birth cohort of persons with FAS could be as high as 39,000 cases annually. Cause-specific mortality is 6% for patients with FAS. The disorder is expensive to treat and most patients have lifelong impairment. The annual cost of care in the United States would approach US$5.0 billion. Early recognition and entry into appropriate treatment programs appear to improve outcome. Prevention efforts should involve screening for alcohol use prior to pregnancy and at the first prenatal care visit. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A1  - Struck J.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The Four-State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Consortium on the Studies of the Prevention of FAS is an effort to bring together resources, both human and material, across the states of Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota to decrease the prevalence of births affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Beginning in September 2000, the Consortium received 3 years of funding and operates through a cooperative agreement with funding from the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Three primary objectives are addressed through the Consortium structure. These include: to develop and evaluate the formation of the Consortium itself; to develop an information base that systematizes data collection that helps determine populations and areas considered high risk; and to implement and test a scientific-based prevention/intervention model for women considered high risk of abusing alcohol during their childbearing years. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction. The microdeletion 22q11.2 affects 1/4000 live births and constitutes the most frequent interstitial chromosomal alteration in humans. It is involved in a heterogeneous series of phenotypic expressions. Aims. To determine the most important clinical characteristics in a series of patients with this genetic-molecular disorder. Patients and methods. We conducted a retrospective study of 16 patients who had been diagnosed, by means ofFISHorPCR, as having microdeletion 22q11.2, and the following data were evaluated in a protocolised manner: sex, age, family background, characteristics of the pregnancy, birth, neonatal and post-neonatal periods, clinical and semiological data, as well as the results from the complementary explorations carried out according to the predominant pathology. Results. The age at which the diagnosis was made oscillated between newly born and 8 years, with a predominance of males overfemales in a ratio of 3.2/1. In all, 81% of patients presented neurological disorders. Brain malformations were seen in six, hypoplasia of the anguli oris muscle in five, congenital facial palsy in three-which was associated with brain malformations in one patient-, retarded neurodevelopment in six cases and neurogenic arthrogryposis in one. Other findings such as congenital heart disease (75%), skeletal disorders (37%), peculiar phenotypes (31%), nephrourological disorders (19%) and hypoacusis (19%) constitute significant manifestations of the process. Some of the most noteworthy occasional events include retarded height and weight development, hypocalcemia and cleft palate. In one case involving a child whose mother suffered from chronic alcoholism, there were both phenotypic traits of this entity and offoetal alcohol syndrome at the same time. In four of the patients the FISH teehnique did not detect the deletion, which was confirmed by a technique involving DNA amplification with PCR. Conclusions. The presence of central and peripheral neurological alterations, together with cardiac, skeletal, renal and auditory disorders was confirmed, as was the existence of neurodevelopmental retardation and a peculiar phenotype. Both the frequency and the kind of disorder coincided with what has been described earlier. A number of facts stand out owing to their novelty. These include the high incidence of asymmetric crying facies, the existence ofdata compatible with foetal alcohol syndrome in one of the patients with this clinical entity, and the association with neurogenic arthrogryposis in another, which are circumstances that suggest the possibility of a causal relation with the deletion 22q11.2. Using DNA amplification with PCR is seen to be of greater diagnostic efficacy than the FISH technique.

T1  - Corpus callosum and visual cortex of mice with deletion of the NMDA-NR1 receptor: II. Attenuation of prenatal alcohol exposure effects
A1  - Deng J.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Offspring of transgenic mice with deletion of the NMDA-NR1 (NR1) receptor received prenatal alcohol exposure during most of gestation. Before and after birth, offspring were sacrificed in order to examine the morphological consequences of the prenatal exposure. Previously, we reported that the dendritic arborization of corpus callosum projection neurons (CCpn) in visual cortex was abnormal in rats given prenatal alcohol exposure; the effects were dose-dependent [Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 24 (2002) 719-732]. The same parameters were examined in the transgenic mice. Crystals of DiI were placed into the CC of mice at different ages that had been prenatally exposed to alcohol. Controls included untreated transgenic mice, and transgenic mice with the same nutritional and handling stressors. Compared to Controls, prenatal alcohol exposure caused the NR1+/+ mice to expand the dendritic arbor of CCpn in visual cortex. The dendritic arbors had increased branch numbers and length; these increases were dose-dependent. In contrast, the prenatally exposed NR1-/- mice showed normal dendritic arbors with all prenatal alcohol doses. In addition, prenatal alcohol exposure was found to have morbidity and teratogenic effects on offspring. In seven separate indicators of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, only one indicator was present but reduced in NR1-/- offspring, indicating that total deletion of the NMDA-NR1 receptor throughout development largely blocks but sometimes attenuates the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Similarly, in seven separate indicators of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, five indicators were attenuated in NR1+/- compared to NR1+/+ offspring, although affected more than in NR1-/-; this suggests a gene-dose effect. The results indicate that functional NMDA-NR1 receptors are necessary for the neurotoxic and teratogenic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. This study will aid in understanding how the NMDA receptors play an important role in prenatal alcohol effects on brain development. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Background. Significant interindividual variability exists following maternal alcohol consumption; not all children born to alcoholic women manifest the symptoms associated with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objective. To investigate the potential role of the placenta as a source of variability by determining if interindividual variability exists in the binding of acetaldehyde to human placenta. Methods. Acetaldehyde was added to ten different human placental homogenates and subjected to equilibrium dialysis. Homogenates of placentae obtained from guinea pigs chronically exposed to ethanol throughout gestation were also dialysed in the presence of acetaldehyde to look for alterations in binding after chronic alcohol exposure. Nonlinear least-squares regression analysis was used to characterize the binding system involved. Results. It was found that the amount of acetaldehyde bound to human placentae varied by as much as 3-fold among placentae. The binding profile of acetaldehyde was characterized as a two site binding system (Ka1 = 9.8 x 105 +/- 0.7 x 105 l/mol, N1 = 1.1 x 10-8 +/- 0.7 x 10-8 mol/g tissue; Ka2 = 1.6 x 104 +/- 0.9 x 104 l/mol, N2 = 1.7 x 10-7 +/- 0.4 x 10-7 mol/g tissue). Chronic alcohol exposure had no effect on the degree of acetaldehyde binding. Conclusion. This previously unidentified source of variability may partially explain why some foetuses are adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure while others are not. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

T1  - Fetal ethanol exposure causes hepatic insulin sensitizing substance-dependent insulin resistance

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and type 2 diabetes occur with high incidence in the same populations and both are associated with autonomic neuropathies. The authors have recently shown that hepatic parasympathetic neuropathy results in insulin resistance of skeletal muscle. The authors tested the hypothesis that fetal ethanol exposure (FEE) results in hepatic insulin sensitizing substance (HISS)-dependent insulin resistance (HDIR) in the adult offspring of rats. The parasympathetic nerves normally provide a permissive signal to the liver, allowing insulin to cause the release of HISS, which stimulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Blockade of the neural signal prevents HISS release, and a state of HDIR ensues, whereby the response to insulin is reduced by 50 to 60% in the fed state. The rapid insulin sensitivity test (RIST), a transient euglycemic clamp, was used. The RIST index is the amount (mg) of glucose per kg of body weight required to maintain euglycemia following a bolus of insulin (50 mU/kg). Adult male offspring of dams who received ethanol through the maternal drinking water, throughout gestation and nursing, showed ethanol dose-related HDIR. The control RIST index of 195.3+/-5.5 mg glucose/kg body weight decreased progressively with maternal consumption of 5 to 20% vol/vol ethanol to 122.5+/-13.9 mg glucose/kg body weight in the 20% ethanol group. HISS-independent insulin action and the glucose disposal effect of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 were unaltered. FEE lead to insulin resistance completely attributable to ethanol dose-related suppression of HISS action (HDIR) in the adult male offspring. The possibility of the same relationship in humans requires evaluation.

N2  - The ontogenetic development of the rat brain cortex Na+, K(+)-ATPase and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities under female ethanol (20% v/v) consumption in the third trimester of gestation or in postpartum period was studied. The weight characteristics (body, whole brain and cortex weight) of viable rats on the first day after birth were not affected critically by prenatal alcohol exposure. It is revealed that the delay of postnatal rat growth 10 days after birth under translactational ethanol consumption is accompanied by reliable decrease of plasma membrane Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity in comparison with control animals. The comparable decrease in activities was observed for the ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-resistant Na+, K(+)-ATPase components (isoform species). From the 20th day the differences in enzyme activity were not revealed. Mg(2+)-ATPase increases in postnatal period independent of Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity and it remains insensitive to postnatal maternal alcohol intake. It is suggested, the first ten day period of lactation is critical for ethanol effect on the developmental control of the brain Na+, K(+)-ATPase functional expression and the course of adaptive processes in the rat organism.

N2  - Frequent alcohol drinking during pregnancy may result in facial dysmorphism, growth retardation and central nervous system deficits in infants ranging from Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). However, few studies has been done to empirical research the psychosomatic approach among women with FAE. In this study, twelve women with FAE infants were selected and interviewed at two or three days after delivery with CMI, MAS, and ANS-S, in order to elucidate the number of problems with mental health of them. All of women with FAE infants drank alcohol during the pregnancy consumed 2 or 3 drinks per week (ethanol consumption less than 92.0 gms per week). The mean mother's age of FAE infants is 30.2 years (range 27-35) and that of healthy mother is 30.3 years (range 24-35). Eleven of 12 (91.7%) infants were identified having the smooth philtrum, 9 (75.0%) with thin upper lip, 3 (25%) with hypersensitivity, 3 (25%) with sleeping disturbance, 2 (16.7%) with growth retardation. Eighty-three percent of infant with FAE had an adequate body weight and height. In comparison with the women without FAE, women with FAE infants were noted to have a significant difference of the score of CMI (p < 0.0001), MAS (p < 0.0001), ANS-S (p < 0.02). Psychosomatic interview revealed that women with FAE infants have increased anxiety neurosis and stress state. Seventy-five percent of women with FAE infants had an anxiety compared with control group (18.8%). Our findings in this study are important because 12 women with FAE infants were not alcoholics and did not consider themselves to have alcohol problems. Therefore, obstetrician has to cut down women alcohol intake considerably during pregnancy for preventing adverse fetal effects. Alcohol consumption and psychometric works also need to be done for detecting at risk use of alcohol during the pregnancy.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to serious birth defects and developmental disabilities. A need exists to develop effective strategies for both children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or other prenatal alcohol-related effects and for women at high risk for having an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Since the syndrome was identified approximately 30 years ago, advancements have been made in FAS diagnostics, surveillance, prevention, and intervention, but a substantial amount of work remains. Collaborations among partners in federal state, and local agencies, academia, clinical professions, school systems, and families are critical to developing and implementing successful efforts related to FAS and fetal alcohol effect (FAE). In 1999, Congress directed the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to convene the National Task Force on FAS and FAE (the Task Force). CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Team, coordinates the Task Force and manages its operation. Since the Task Force was chartered in 2000, Task Force members, with input from multiple partners, have convened to deliberate and determine the Task Force mission, goals, and priority concerns to be addressed. This report describes the structure, function, mission, and goals of the Task Force and provides their first recommendations. An explanation of how the Task Force recommendations were generated and the Task Forces next steps are also reported.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol often induces birth defects that combine morphological stigmata with neurological or neuropsychological deficits. But it has proved problematic to diagnose these syndromes in adolescents and adults, in whom the morphological signs are absent or attenuated, the behavioral deficits nonspecific, and the exposure history often difficult to reconstruct. Localizing the associated brain abnormalities might circumvent most of these difficulties. To this end, three-dimensional (3D) locations were recorded for 67 homologous points on or near the corpus callosum in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images from 60 adolescents and adults who were normal, 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, and 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol effects. We combined the standard statistical approach to this type of geometric data, Procrustes analysis, with a multivariate strategy focusing on differences in variability. In this data set, the shape of the corpus callosum and its vicinity proves systematically much more variable in the alcohol-affected brains than in those of the normal subjects. From this excess variability follows a promising classification rule, having both high sensitivity (100 out of 117) and high specificity (49 out of 60) in this sample. The discrimination uses four landmark points and two summary scores of callosal outline shape. The information from the corpus callosum and vicinity, as viewed in MR brain images of full-grown subjects, may serve as a permanent record of the prenatal effects of alcohol, even in patients who are first suspected of these syndromes relatively late in life or who lack the facial signs of prenatal alcohol damage. The statistical pattern underlying the callosal diagnosis also leads to speculations on mechanisms of the prenatal damage. Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Alcohol use among women of childbearing age--United States, 1991-1999
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, mental retardation, and neurodevelopmental disorders in the United States. One of the national health objectives for 2010 is to increase to 94% the percentage of pregnant women abstaining from alcohol use [corrected]. During 1991-1995, alcohol use by pregnant women increased substantially, and alcohol use by nonpregnant women of childbearing age increased slightly. To characterize trends in alcohol use among women of childbearing age, CDC analyzed representative survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) during 1991-1999. This report summarizes the results of the analysis, which indicate that the rate of any alcohol use (i.e., at least one drink) during pregnancy has declined since 1995. However, rates of binge drinking (i.e., > or = 5 drinks on any one occasion) and frequent drinking (i.e., > or = 7 drinks per week or > or = 5 drinks on any one occasion) during pregnancy have not declined among nonpregnant women of childbearing age. Health-care providers should routinely screen women of childbearing age for alcohol use and counsel them about the adverse effects of alcohol use during pregnancy.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome prevention research
A1  - Hankin J.R.
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have numerous adverse health consequences for the developing fetus, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related effects, and therefore is a significant public health problem. A variety of programs have been developed to prevent drinking during pregnancy and the resulting health problems. Some of these efforts, such as public service announcements and beverage warning labels, are universal and strive to increase the public's knowledge about FAS. Selective prevention approaches target women of reproductive age who drink alcohol. Such approaches may involve screening all pregnant women for alcohol consumption and counseling those women who do drink. Indicated prevention approaches target high-risk women (e.g., women who have previously abused alcohol or have had a child with FAS or other alcohol-related effects) and typically offer repeated counseling over several years. Both selective and indicated prevention efforts can reduce maternal alcohol consumption and improve the outcome of the offspring.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome--Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, and New York, 1995-1997
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. FAS is diagnosed on the basis of a combination of growth deficiency (pre- or postnatal), central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, facial dysmorphology, and maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Estimates of the prevalence of FAS vary from 0.2 to 1.0 per 1,000 live-born infants. This variation is due, in part, to the small size of the populations studied, varying case definitions, and different surveillance methods. In addition, differences have been noted among racial/ethnic populations. To monitor the occurrence of FAS, CDC collaborated with five states (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, New York, and Wisconsin*) to develop the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network (FASSNet). This report summarizes the results of an analysis of FASSNet data on children born during 1995-1997, which indicate that FAS rates in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, and New York ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 per 1,000 live-born infants and were highest for black and American Indian/Alaska Native populations. This study demonstrates that FASSNet is a useful tool that enables health care professionals to monitor the occurrence of FAS and to evaluate the impact of prevention, education, and intervention efforts.

T1  - The Toronto experience in diagnosing alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder: A unique profile of deficits and assets
A1  - Greenbaum R.

A1  - Rovet J.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which involves the triad of features reflecting facial dysmorphology, growth retardation and intellectual impairments, encompasses a relatively small proportion of the children affected prenatally by alcohol. Unfortunately, in the absence of facial dysmorphology, the diagnosis is difficult in the majority of children, who are considered to have alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Because accepted clinical methods are not pathognomonic, a novel profile approach was used to examine neuropsychological abilities and disabilities to identify children with ARND who do not meet the diagnostic criteria of FAS. OBJECTIVE: To establish a set of criteria, to be validated in future studies, for characterizing the neuropsychological profile of children with ARND. By describing the procedures at this preliminary stage of our work, the goal is to draw attention to this neglected topic and to suggest a model that can be replicated and validated by others, and to provide the first systematic clinical report on diagnosing ARND in Canada. PROCEDURES: On the basis of the literature, parents' descriptions and the authors' own experience with ARND, a profile of neuropsychological characteristics, including both deficits and assets, that are associated with prenatal alcohol exposure was hypothesized. A group of children was then evaluated, mostly adoptees or children in foster care, who were referred for learning and behavioural problems potentially associated with gestational exposure. Their results were submitted to a profile analysis by comparing their deficits and assets according to a list describing a hypothetical ARND profile to determine whether each child fit or did not fit the ARND profile. Groups were compared for background characteristics, FAS symptomatology, and results on specific neuropsychological and behavioural tests. Finally, the characteristics most strongly differentiating the two groups were identified. SETTING: Hospital-based outpatient program. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two children aged four to 18 years who were referred for a diagnostic assessment related to suspected or known prenatal alcohol exposure. OUTCOME MEASURES: Each child's assessment results were compared against a list of 21 deficits and six assets by two independent raters. Children with an average of more than 60% deficits and 50% assets were considered to have ARND, while the remainder were not. RESULTS: Twenty-eight children (54%) were assigned to the ARND group and 24 to the non-ARND group. The groups did not differ in physical features or home background characteristics, with the exception of higher parental intelligence quotient in the non-ARND group. The ARND group was more likely to have repeated a grade or received special education and scored lower on standardized measures of intelligence, language and memory abilities. Frequency of behaviour or social problems were equivalent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A profile approach used to identify children with ARND discriminates problems in neuropsychological but not behavioural domains. Because elevated scores on behavioural tasks in both ARND and non-ARND groups were clinically significant, more research is needed to identify what behavioural problems are unique to children with ARND compared with other clinic-referred children.

N2  - Here we report on detailed three-dimensional quantitative maps of brain surface and gray matter density asymmetry patterns during normal adolescent development and show how these anatomical features of the brain are disrupted as a result of prenatal exposure to large quantities of alcohol. We studied two independent samples of normally developing children, adolescents, and young adults, totaling 83 subjects from two different research groups, and compared them to 21 individuals with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Surface-based image analysis techniques allowed us to match cortical anatomy across subjects and between hemispheres based on manually delineated sulcal landmarks. Quantitative maps of brain surface asymmetry reveal prominent peri-Sylvian hemispheric differences in which the superior temporal and inferior parietal cortices are shifted backward in the left relative to the right hemisphere in both normal and alcohol-exposed subjects. Cortical surface gray matter asymmetry, mapped here in adolescent populations, is most prominent in the posterior inferior temporal lobes (right greater than left), and this effect does not differ between groups of normally developing children, adolescents, or young adults. Alcohol-exposed individuals show a significant reduction in this asymmetry, whether studied with surface-based or more traditional volumetric region of interest analyses. This region of cortex, near the junction of Brodmann's areas 21, 22, and 37, primarily subserves language functions that are known to be impaired on average in the alcohol-exposed subjects. Our findings elucidate regional patterns of brain surface and gray matter asymmetry during normal development and may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the neural substrates of cognitive dysfunction after heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to alcohol (prenatal alcohol exposure) is associated with gross and fine motor skill dysfunction. The present study examined performance on two types of timing tasks to determine the extent to which prenatal alcohol exposure affects perception, movement planning, and movement execution during tasks that require temporal processing. Methods: Fourteen children with confirmed heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 22 control children (aged 5-10 years) completed two timing tasks: a coincident-anticipation timing task that primarily assessed central processing, and a movement-speed timing task that evaluated the motor component of temporal processing. Absolute error, signed error, and variability of the participant's signed error were the dependent variables. Results: For both timing tasks, children with prenatal alcohol exposure were significantly less accurate and more variable than control children, indicating that both the sensory-perceptual and motor components of temporal processing were disrupted in alcohol-exposed children. Conclusions: Alcohol-exposed children had difficulty producing accurate and consistent motor responses when intercepting a moving target or moving through a spatial target in a specified amount of time. Disruptions in these motor timing behaviors may be indicative of alcohol-related cerebellar or basal ganglia damage.

T1  - Interhemispheric transfer in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure

A1  - Mattson S.N.
A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has long been associated with alterations in brain structure and behavioral changes. The corpus callosum can be affected by heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, and agenesis (absence) of this structure occurs more often in children with fetal alcohol syndrome than in the general population or in other developmentally delayed populations. Although the majority of children with fetal alcohol syndrome do not have agenesis of the corpus callosum, callosal area is reduced in this population, particularly in the anterior and posterior regions. However, the functional implication of these size reductions has not been examined. Methods: The current study used a finger localization task to measure the transfer of information across the corpus callosum in children and adolescents with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and age- and sex-matched controls. In a subset of children, correlational analysis was also conducted between behavioral data and cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum. Results: When compared with nonexposed controls, alcohol-exposed children made more errors on trials for which information had to cross the corpus callosum ("crossed" trials) than on trials for which it did not ("uncrossed" trials), and they also made more errors as the task increased in complexity. Additionally, correlations with magnetic resonance imaging data in a subset of children revealed that impairment in interhemispheric transfer was related to reductions in the size of the corpus callosum. These correlations were independent of effects expected from the relationship between corpus callosum size and general intellectual functioning alone. Conclusions: These findings suggest that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure display subtle deficits in the interhemispheric transfer of information in the somatosensory domain. Such deficits in interhemispheric transfer are likely to be related to the myriad of other behavioral and cognitive impairments observed in these children.

N2  - Alcohol is a known teratogenic substance that operates under a dose-response mechanism. Before we conducted a larger study that examines the use of alcohol both before pregnancy and during pregnancy, it was important to pilot our method for measuring a pregnant mother's alcohol use that would allow us to capture the number of drinks consumed per day while addressing recall bias. The purpose of this study was 1) to pilot the Time Line Followback (TLFB) method developed by Sobell and Sobell (1992, Measuring Alcohol Use. Totowa, NJ: Humana Press) as a method for examining alcohol use during pregnancy and 2) to determine if the use of a study protocol that included biological markers of alcohol use would affect our ability to recruit subjects. Using a descriptive design, we tested our protocol for collecting alcohol use data with 10 mothers receiving prenatal care. We measured alcohol use using the TLFB method (Sobell and Sobell, 1992, Measuring Alcohol Use. Totowa, NJ: Humana Press, 1996). We also collected collected biological blood markers for heavy alcohol use. Of the 10 maternal subjects we recruited, 5 mothers (50%) reported alcohol use during pregnancy. We successfully recruited 10 out of 11 mothers approached and had a 100% retention rate for the second interview. The TLFB method is viable for measuring fetal alcohol exposure over the pregnancy, and the collection of blood samples did not impact our ability to recruit or retain mothers.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to describe psychiatric disorders exhibited by children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Twentythree children between the ages of 5 and 13 years who were referred to the UCLA Fetal Alcohol and Related Disorders Clinic because of heavy exposure to alcohol in utero were evaluated. Children with intelligence quotients of 70 and above and their families were interviewed by the study child psychiatrist and psychologist and psychiatric diagnoses were based upon DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Inter-observer reliability of diagnosis was established comparing clinical diagnoses with diagnoses made using the "best-estimate" procedure. For the best estimate method, items from the Child Behavior Checklist, the Fetal Alcohol Behavior Scale, the Child Symptom Inventory-4, the Conners' Rating Scale, as well as information from historical records were reviewed by two experienced clinicians who were blind to the diagnostic and alcohol exposure status of the children. Approximately 87% of the sample met criteria for a psychiatric disorder. The majority of the children (61%) were assigned a mood disorder diagnosis. Twenty-six percent were diagnosed with major depressive disorder or adjustment disorder with depressed mood and 35% met criteria for bipolar disorder. Psychiatric disorders are common in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. In particular, these children seem to be highly vulnerable to mood disorders. There is a need for training in how to recognize the physical and behavioral phenotypes of children with prenatal alcohol exposure so that appropriate treatment can be initiated early.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure produces many developmental defects of the central nervous system (CNS), such as in the corpus callosum (CC). This study was designed to observe the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure during the second trimester equivalent on the development of dendritic arbors of CC projection neurons (CCpn) in rat visual cortex. In addition, the effect of second trimester equivalent prenatal alcohol exposure on brain weight was determined. Pregnant dams received 1.2-6.0 g/kg ethanol (EtOH) during gestational day (G) 11-20. Controls consisted of normal and nutritionally matched pairfed (PF) dams. Pups were sacrificed on the day of birth, G26, G29 and G33. DiI crystals were placed in the midsagittal CC bundle to retrogradely label CCpn. Images of visual cortex were obtained from tissue slices using a confocal laser scanning microscope. The number and length of apical and basilar dendrite branches were determined. The results show that prenatal alcohol exposure restricted to the second trimester equivalent alters the development of the CCpn dendritic arbor and the brain weight in a blood alcohol concentration (BAC)-dependent manner. The alteration in the EtOH CCpn is manifested as an increase in the number and length of CCpn apical and basilar dendrite branches, while brain weight is reduced compared with Controls. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - This prospective study evaluated the relations between maternal alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use during pregnancy and children's growth at 6 years. In this cohort of pregnant teenagers and their offspring, mothers were recruited from an urban prenatal clinic between 1990 and 1995, and observed from their fourth prenatal month. At the delivery assessment, there were 413 live-born singletons. At the 6-year visit, 345 children and mothers were evaluated. Prenatal alcohol and marijuana exposure were significantly associated with growth deficits, after controlling statistically for other prenatal substance use, current maternal substance use, current environmental tobacco exposure (ETS) and sociodemographic and growth-related covariates. There was a significant negative association between the second and third trimester alcohol exposure and offspring height. Third trimester alcohol exposure predicted reduced skinfold thickness. Exposure to any prenatal marijuana in the second trimester was significantly associated with shorter stature. First trimester tobacco exposure was associated with increased skinfold thickness among the 6-year-olds. The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth at birth persisted in older children despite a low level of exposure during gestation. Effects of prenatal marijuana exposure on reduced height were not anticipated and occurred only when use was categorized as any/none. These data are consistent with an emerging body of evidence indicating that, by contrast to the growth deficits associated with smoking during pregnancy, which are evident at birth, the shorter stature associated with prenatal alcohol exposure continues to be evident during childhood. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - We determined the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a foster care population and evaluated the performance of the FAS Facial Photographic Screening Tool. All children enrolled in a Washington State Foster Care Passport Program were screened for three conditions: (1) the FAS facial phenotype from a photograph, (2) evidence of brain damage with prenatal alcohol exposure from their Health and Education passport, and/or (3) other syndromes identifiable from a facial photograph. Screen-positives received diagnostic evaluations at a FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network clinic. The prevalence of FAS in this foster care population was 10 to 15/1000, or 10 to 15 times greater than in the general population. The screening tool performed with 100% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity, 85.7% predictive value positive, and 100% predictive value negative. We conclude that the foster care population is a high-risk population for FAS. The screening tool performed with very high accuracy and could be used to track FAS prevalence over time in foster care to accurately assess the effectiveness of primary prevention efforts.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and attachment behavior in children

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Background: This study examined the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and attachment behavior in 4- and 5-year-old children. Prenatal alcohol exposure was hypothesized to be associated with insecure attachment behavior of the child toward the mother. It was also hypothesized that children with heavier prenatal alcohol exposure would exhibit higher levels of negative affect as well as poorer coping skills. The quality of maternal support in interaction with the child was predicted to mediate prenatal exposure effects. Methods: Participants were 42 mother-child dyads, the majority of whom came from poverty backgrounds in which the mother was a single parent. Attachment security was measured using the Attachment Q-Set. Results: Results revealed that prenatal alcohol exposure was highly related to attachment insecurity. Eighty percent of children who were exposed to alcohol during gestation were insecure, whereas 36% of unexposed children were insecure. Prenatal alcohol exposure also predicted child negative affect, which was related to lower levels of maternal emotional support of the child. However, when the mothers of the prenatally exposed children provided high levels of support, these children evidenced better coping skills and more secure attachment relations. Conclusions: Although prenatal alcohol exposure was found to relate to higher levels of insecure attachment, children of mothers who provided them with emotional support were more able to deal with frustration. These children also exhibited higher levels of attachment security. Thus, the mother's supportive presence may mediate the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and the child's security of attachment.

N2  - Background: Growth deficits are among the cardinal features for the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. Growth deficits have also been noted among those who were exposed to alcohol prenatally but who do not have fetal alcohol syndrome. Few studies have observed subjects past early and middle childhood, however, to evaluate the longer-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth in adolescence. This is a report of the effects of alcohol exposure during gestation on the size of the offspring at 14 years of age. Methods: Women were recruited in their fourth prenatal month. These women were interviewed in the fourth and seventh months of pregnancy and at delivery. The women and their children were seen when the offspring were 14 years of age. Results: Growth deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were identified among the offspring at 14 years of age. Weight, height, head circumference, and skinfold thickness continued to be significantly affected by prenatal alcohol exposure after controlling for other significant predictors of size. These effects exhibited a dose-response pattern, and significant effects were found at levels below one drink per day. For example, first trimester alcohol exposure predicted weights of 152 lbs for the offspring of abstainers, 149 lbs for the offspring of light drinkers (>0 and <0.2 drinks per day), 143 lbs for the offspring of moderate drinkers (>0.2 and <0.89 drinks per day), and 136 lbs for the offspring of heavy drinkers (>0.89 drinks per day). Conclusions: Prenatal alcohol exposure continues to affect size at age 14 years in this cohort of children followed since their fourth month of gestation.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - The article reviews the literature concerning the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain development, IQ, reaction time, attention and hyperactivity behavior, gait and balance functioning and gross and fine motor skill performance. A description of the brain damage caused by the teratogenic effects of alcohol exposure is included to provide the clinician with a basis for understanding the causes of the associated cognitive and motor dysfunctions. Specific characteristics of IQ, gait and posture deficits were selected for review as these deficits represent overt manifestations of alcohol exposure observed by the clinician. The article concludes with a series of suggested rehabilitation measures designed to address specific cognitive and motor deficits.

N2  - Background: The present study investigated central and peripheral processing speed using simple reaction time (SRT) and choice reaction time (CRT) tasks in children who were exposed to alcohol in utero compared with control subjects. Each RT interval was fractionated into premotor and motor components to assess the central processing of stimulus information and peripheral motor unit recruitment, respectively. Methods: Eleven children with confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) and 13 control subjects (NC), aged 5 to 10 years, completed 20 trials of both SRT and CRT tasks. Muscle activity was recorded from the biceps brachii muscle of each arm using electromyography to facilitate the fractionating of RT into premotor and motor components. Results: ALC children exhibited significantly slower premotor RTs during the CRT task. Motor RTs were also slower for the ALC group during both SRT and CRT tasks. ALC children exhibited greater response variability compared with control subjects; however, the magnitude of this variability was not greater than would be predicted, given their lengthened RTs. In contrast, response variability was greater for young children of both groups even after accounting for mean RT. Significant age-related differences in premotor and motor RTs were also observed. Conclusions: Alcohol-related increases in CRT were attributable to longer premotor and motor components, reflecting both reduced speed of information processing and peripheral delays in responding. These alterations likely are associated with alcohol-related changes in the central and peripheral nervous systems that could impede or slow neuronal transmission.

N2  - Serotonin (5-HT) has specific roles not only as a transmitter but also as a signal for differentiation. We recently found that alcohol drinking during pregnancy resulted in incomplete neural tube fusion which hindered the development of midline cells such as 5-HT neurons in mice. We now report that, at the birth of 5-HT neurons (E11), the 5-HT immunoreactive (5-HT-im) neurons are often found missing medial projecting fibers towards ventricle in the Alcohol treated group (ALC) as compared with pair-fed (PF) and Chow-fed groups (Chow) in mice. At E13, there are fewer 5-HT-im neurons in either dorsal or median raphe of ALC as compared with PF or Chow; furthermore, neurite outgrowth and migration of the 5-HT neurons are also compromised with alcohol exposure. We, thus, demonstrated that fetal alcohol exposure compromised 5-HT development as early as at the 5-HT neuron birth. Since 5-HT is a signal for development of many forebrain neurons, the deviation of 5-HT in early life may have consequences on brain development that extend beyond those seen in the 5-HT system.

T1  - Ethanol induces morphological and dynamic changes on in vivo and in vitro neural crest cells

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is an embryopathology related to maternal alcohol drinking. The information concerning the factors involved in the prenatal mechanisms of ethanol action at the cellular and molecular levels is scarce. Because several abnormal changes in FAS involve regions colonized by cell lineages derived from neural crest cells (NCCs), it is reasonable to propose that epigenetic alteration of this cell population can represent an important component of the etiopathogeny. The aim of this work was to evaluate the direct effect of ethanol on a chick embryo model, as well as on in vitro NCC morphology and dynamic behavior. Methods: After ethanol treatment, in ovo or cultured chick embryos were used to determine the anatomical development of and to quantify the migratory parameters and apoptosis of NCCs. Scanning electron microscopy was performed on ethanol-perfused (and control) cultures of cephalic and trunk NCCs; the actin cytoskeleton was evaluated, and morphometric and dynamic parameters were determined after time-lapse videorecording. Recovery capacity after ethanol treatment was also determined. Results: Chick embryos submitted to conditions sufficient to induce FAS in mammals displayed developmental disruptions frequently accompanied by cephalic/facial anomalies. In vitro studies also indicated that cephalic and trunk NCCs exposed to ethanol exhibited significant and permanent changes regarding cell shape, surface morphology, apoptotic cell death, cytoskeleton, and distance and velocity traveled, as well as an abnormal pattern of migration. Conclusions: Taking into account that even a limited period of abnormal behavior may imply serious consequences in the final cues of an embryonic cell population, our results indicate that the biological effects of ethanol on early development - even during a short time - could induce permanent ontogenetic perturbations of NCCs, with potentially dramatic effects on embryonic morphogenesis. These results support an important participation of NCCs in the etiopathogeny of FAS.

N2  - Persons with brain damage consequent to prenatal alcohol exposure have typically been diagnosed with either fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE), depending on facial features. There is great variability of behavioral deficits within these groups. We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with neurocognitive and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over the variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline curves of the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions from T1-weighted MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15 with FAE, and 15 who were unexposed and clinically normal. From 5 h of neuropsychological testing we extracted 260 scores and ratings pertaining to attention, memory, executive function, fine and gross motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline shape was analyzed by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to behavior by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly more variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With the excess shape variation are associated two different profiles of behavioral deficit unrelated to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE distinction within the exposed subgroup. A relatively thick callosum is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive function; one that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed from the unexposed in this sample. Thus there is considerable information in callosal form for prognosis of neuropsychological deficits in this frequently encountered birth defect. © 2002 Elsevier Science.

N2  - We assessed regional brain shape abnormalities and spatial relationships between brain shape and abnormalities observed in the underlying tissue in children and adolescents prenatally exposed to large quantities of alcohol. We used high resolution, 3-D, structural magnetic resonance imaging data and novel, whole-brain, surface-based image analysis procedures to study 21 subjects with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (8-22 years, mean age 12.6 years) and 21 normally developing control subjects (8-25 years, mean age 13.5 years). Significant brain size and shape abnormalities were observed in the alcohol-exposed subjects in inferior parietal/perisylvian regions bilaterally, where their brains appeared to be narrower than those of the controls in the same general location where they also had increased gray matter density. Highly significant decreased brain surface extent or reduced brain growth was also observed in the ventral aspects of the frontal lobes most prominent in the left hemisphere. For the first time in this report we have mapped brain morphologic abnormalities to the cortical surface in subjects with prenatal alcohol exposure and have shown that the size and shape of the brain is altered in these individuals. The results imply that brain growth continues to be adversely affected long after the prenatal insult of alcohol exposure to the developing brain and the brain regions most implicated, frontal and inferior parietal/perisylvian, may be consistent with behavioral deficits characteristic of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol often induces birth defects that combine morphological stigmata with neurological or neuropsychological deficits. But it has proved problematic to diagnose these syndromes in adolescents and adults, in whom the morphological signs are absent or attenuated, the behavioral deficits nonspecific, and the exposure history often difficult to reconstruct. Localizing the associated brain abnormalities might circumvent most of these difficulties. To this end, three-dimensional (3D) locations were recorded for 67 homologous points on or near the corpus callosum in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images from 60 adolescents and adults who were normal, 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, and 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol effects. We combined the standard statistical approach to this type of geometric data, Procrustes analysis, with a multivariate strategy focusing on differences in variability. In this data set, the shape of the corpus callosum and its vicinity proves systematically much more variable in the alcohol-affected brains than in those of the normal subjects. From this excess variability follows a promising classification rule, having both high sensitivity (100 out of 117) and high specificity (49 out of 60) in this sample. The discrimination uses four landmark points and two summary scores of callosal outline shape. The information from the corpus callosum and vicinity, as viewed in MR brain images of full-grown subjects, may serve as a permanent record of the prenatal effects of alcohol, even in patients who are first suspected of these syndromes relatively late in life or who lack the facial signs of prenatal alcohol damage. The statistical pattern underlying the callosal diagnosis also leads to speculations on mechanisms of the prenatal damage. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Postnatal stress of early weaning exacerbates behavioral outcome in prenatal alcohol-exposed juvenile rats
A1  - Zimmerberg B.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Some of the behavioral deficits caused by prenatal or postnatal alcohol exposure have been demonstrated to be ameliorated by environmental manipulations such as handling or environmental enrichment. This experiment, in contrast, investigated whether behavioral deficits due to prenatal alcohol exposure could be exacerbated by a stressful experience, early weaning. Pregnant dams were given either a liquid diet with 35% of the calories derived from alcohol, a liquid diet without alcohol to control for any effects of the liquid diet administration, or ad libitum food and water. Half of each litter were weaned at 15 days of age (early weaning) and half were weaned at 21 days of age (normally weaned). Offspring were weighed, tested for activity in an open field at 18 days of age, and trained to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze at 22-24 days of age. Alcohol-exposed subjects who were weaned early were more impaired in spatial navigation ability than any other group. Similarly, the combination of early weaning and prenatal alcohol exposure caused the slowest growth. All subjects exposed to alcohol, regardless of weaning condition, had greater latencies to find the platform than those from the two control groups. There was no synergistic effect of alcohol and stress on activity levels, but all early-weaned females were more active than normally weaned females; males did not show this effect. Thus, environmental stressors such as early weaning can compound detrimental symptoms of prenatal alcohol exposure. These results have implications for the understanding of the effects of the environment on neuronal plasticity. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Acquisition and retention of verbal and nonverbal information in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Mattson S.N.
A1  - Roebuck T.M.
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Background: Memory deficits are reported commonly in children with fetal alcohol syndrome. However, little, is known about nonverbal memory performance in this population. Methods: The current study examined learning and memory abilities in alcohol-exposed children and nonexposed controls. Multiple verbal and nonverbal measures were used that incorporated repeated learning trials and delayed recall trials. The alcohol-exposed group included children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with and without fetal alcohol syndrome. Children ranged in age from 8 to 16 years, and groups were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure displayed deficits in learning and recall of verbal and nonverbal information across all measures. On learning trials, they recalled fewer words and displayed a lower rate of acquisition. However, when we analyzed delayed verbal recall data after controlling for initial verbal learning, group differences were not apparent. The same pattern did not occur for nonverbal information; children with prenatal alcohol exposure recalled less on delayed recall even when we accounted for initial learning. Conclusions: These data are consistent with previous studies that indicate immediate memory deficits but suggest that, at least for verbal information, delayed recall deficits in this population are better accounted for by deficits in initial learning. Importantly, a different pattern of results was demonstrated for verbal versus nonverbal information, which suggests the need for additional research in this area.

N2  - Alcohol is a physical and behavioural teratogen. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common yet under-recognized condition resulting from maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. While preventable, FAS is also disabling. Although FAS is found in all socioeconomic groups in Canada, it has been observed at high prevalence in select First Nations and Inuit communities in Canada. This statement addresses FAS prevention, diagnosis, early identification and management for health care professionals. Prevention of FAS must occur at two levels. Primary prevention involves eliminating FAS through classroom or community education, and encouraging women to avoid consuming alcohol before conception and throughout pregnancy. Secondary prevention involves identifying women who are drinking while pregnant and reducing their consumption. This statement describes a variety of screening strategies including Tolerance-Annoyance, Cut Down, Eye Opener (T-ACE). Medical practitioners should recommend abstinence starting with the first prenatal visit. Prompt referral for alcohol treatment is recommended for pregnant individuals who are unable to stop drinking alcohol. This statement describes the diagnosis of FAS, partial or atypical FAS, alcohol-related birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. With a history of in-utero alcohol exposure, a diagnosis of FAS should be considered with current or previous growth deficiency, select facial abnormalities involving the upper lip and eyes, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. These features are best quantified with the use of a four-digit diagnostic method. Strategies for early identification of possible alcohol-related abnormalities are outlined. Intervention focuses on optimizing development, managing behavioural difficulties and providing appropriate school programming. Of prime importance is earliest possible childhood intervention to prevent secondary disabilities that may result from delay while awaiting a definitive diagnosis of FAS.

N2  - Objective: Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) births were examined as part of a larger epidemiologic study of FAS in a community in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Method: Using retrospective case-control methodology, 31 mothers who had given birth to FAS children 6 to 9 years previously were compared with 31 matched controls on a variety of demographic, socioeconomic, drinking, family and maternity variables. Descriptive analyses were utilized to determine major differential characteristics between the two groups. Results: In this community with a very high rate of FAS and rather uniform low socioeconomic status, the two groups were found to be comparable with respect to age, annual income, ethnic background, age of initiation of regular drinking, age at birth of the index child, gravidity and parity. However, mothers of FAS children reported initiating drinking at an earlier age, as well as reporting higher rates of heavy alcohol consumption in their extended family, current use of alcohol, drinking before and during pregnancy, and smoking of tobacco (percentage who smoke) during each trimester of the pregnancy. Mothers of FAS children had lower educational attainment and reported lower religiosity than control mothers. Conclusions: This study in South Africa draws upon the experience of mothers of 31 children with FAS to confirm many of the same high-risk variables identified in maternal risk studies in the United States and Europe. Some factors associated with less maternal alcohol abuse in this high-risk population were also identified, which may be helpful for implementing prevention in this region as well as in other developing countries.

N2  - To assess the teratogenic action of ethanol on cardiac contractile function in offspring exposed to ethanol in utero, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with ethanol during gestation. Left-ventricular papillary muscles and myocytes were isolated from the offspring of the ethanol-ingesting and control pregnant rats. Mechanical parameters measured were peak tension development (PTD, indicating the myocardial force-generating capacity), peak cell shortening (PS), time-to-PTD/PS (TPT/TPS), time-to-90% relaxation/re-lengthening (RT90/TR90), and maximal velocities of contraction/shortening and relaxation/re-lengthening (+/-VT and +/-dL/dt). Intracellular Ca2+ levels and apoptosis were evaluated with fura-2 fluorescent dye and Caspase-3 activation assay, respectively. Offspring of the ethanol group displayed decreased heart weight associated with comparable body, liver and kidney weight, and papillary muscle weight/size, compared to the control group. However, prenatal ethanol exposure depressed myocardial PTD and +/-VT. The myocardium from the ethanol group also exhibited slightly but significantly shortened TPT, accompanied with normal RT90. Muscles from both groups exhibited comparable responses to post-rest potentiation, increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration, noradrenaline and acute ethanol challenge. Ventricular myocytes from both the control and ethanol groups possessed similar PS, TPS, TR90 and +/-dL/dt. Both resting and peak intracellular Ca2+ levels were elevated in myocytes from the ethanol group. Additionally, acute ethanol application depressed caffeine-induced intracellular Ca2+ rise in myocytes from both groups. Myocytes from the ethanol group displayed an enhanced Caspase-3 activation, compared to control myocytes. These results suggest that prenatal ethanol exposure alters myocardial contractile function and may contribute to the development of postnatal cardiac dysfunction through, in part, increased intracellular Ca2+ loading and apoptosis.

N2  - This study examined 17 children (nine males, eight females; mean age 13 years) with prenatal alcohol exposure of various durations. The aim of the study was to detect specific brain morphological alterations by means of MRI and to see if findings correlated with particular cognitive deficits. Of the 17 children, five had been exposed to heavy maternal consumption of alcohol (over 10 drinks/week) during the first trimester only; four had been exposed during the first and second trimester; and eight had been exposed throughout pregnancy. Five children had alcohol related neurobehavioural disorder, seven were diagnosed as having foetal alcohol effects and five were diagnosed as having foetal alcohol syndrome. Hypoplasia of the vermis was observed in 10 children and malformed posterior vermis in one additional child. Five children had hypoplastic cerebellar hemispheres. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum was observed in two children. Small hippocampi were observed in three children and wide cortical sulci in six. No specific structural anomaly correlated with a particular neuropsychological deficit. In this study, deviations in the development of the vermis was the most sensitive morphological indicator of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It was seen in every diagnostic group including children who had been exposed during only the first trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - The question of whether psychosocial stress during pregnancy (alone or in combination with fetal alcohol exposure) has negative consequences for offspring has not been clearly established in human studies. In this article, we present an overview of three prospective longitudinal studies. Using rhesus monkeys as subjects, a noise or hormone stressor, alone or in combination with moderate level alcohol solution, was presented daily during different stages of pregnancy. Prenatal stress resulted in lighter birth weights in two of three studies, and males from the alcohol plus noise stress condition had reduced birth weights. There were no significant effects of any of the prenatal treatments on gestation duration. Both prenatal stress and moderate fetal alcohol exposure reduced attention span and neuromotor capabilities of offspring during the first month of life, while early gestation prenatal stress, during the period of neuronal migration, emerged as a period of enhanced vulnerability for these effects. Under conditions of challenge, prenatally stressed monkeys showed more disturbance behaviors and reduced locomotion and exploration as well as altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to stress. Fetal alcohol exposed monkeys also showed increased HPA axis activity in response to stressful conditions. Finally, altered patterns of alcohol consumption during adolescence were associated with prenatal stress. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Exposure during pregnancy to alcohol (ethanol) produces a number of adverse effects. One of them is fetal alcohol syndrome. The hallmark of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is craniofacial dysmorphism and the changes in craniofacial measurement are dependent on the alcoholic dose and its time of exposure. Since prenatal ethanol exposure can alter craniofacial development in rodents and reliably produce long-term behavioral effect in them, the present study was designed to extend the same changes in the Sprague Dawley species. METHODS: The albino rat was studied to determine whether gestational exposure to alcohol (Ethanol) produces permanent craniofacial effect. On gestational day (GD7-10) 25% ethanol was injected intraperitoneally to pregnant rats. Various dimensions for skull and face of adult male rats were taken. RESULTS: Both vertical and coronal dimensions were altered in the exposed animals. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that exposure to ethanol on a critical gestational period produces permanent craniofacial defects.

N2  - Detecting alcohol use among pregnant women is an important step toward preventing alcohol-related birth defects. A biomarker that could detect alcohol use during pregnancy would aid in earlier identification and intervention for affected infants. The existing potential biomarkers for identifying alcohol use during pregnancy can detect varying degrees of alcohol exposure, or use. However, further research is needed to evaluate these biomarkers.

N2  - Converging evidence from various research areas indicates that people who have been exposed to alcohol prenatally may exhibit impairments on the performance of relatively complex and novel tasks. These tasks include tests designed to measure executive functioning (EF)--the ability to plan and guide behavior to achieve a goal in an efficient manner. EF can be categorized into two domains, cognition-based EF and emotion-related EF. People prenatally exposed to alcohol show impaired performance on tests assessing both domains. Moreover, one cognition-based and two emotion-related measures of EF appear to be reliable and stable predictors of behavioral problems in alcohol-affected people. A deficit in flexible recruitment of brain regions to do complex tasks may underlie the EF deficits in people prenatally exposed to alcohol.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Since the late 1970s, many studies have reported on the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (ARND). The three main types of research methods used in these studies are passive surveillance, clinic-based studies, and active case ascertainment. This article describes each of these methods, including their strengths and weaknesses, and summarizes the estimated prevalence of FAS produced by each of these approaches. The maternal risk factors associated with FAS and other alcohol-related anomalies include advanced maternal age, low socioeconomic status, frequent binge drinking, family and friends with drinking problems, and poor social and psychological indicators. Overall, the available literature points to a prevalence rate of FAS of 0.5 to 2 cases per 1,000 births in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is often associated with cardiac hypertrophy and impaired ventricular function in a manner similar to postnatal chronic alcohol ingestion. Chronic alcoholism has been shown to lead to hypomagnesemia, and dietary Mg2+ supplementation was shown to ameliorate ethanol-induced cardiovascular dysfunction such as hypertension. However, the role of gestational Mg2+ supplementation on FAS-related cardiac dysfunction is unknown. This study was conducted to examine the influence of gestational dietary Mg2+ supplementation on prenatal ethanol exposure-induced cardiac contractile response at the ventricular myocyte level. Timed-pregnancy female rats were fed from gestation day 2 with liquid diets containing 0.13 g/L Mg2+ supplemented with ethanol (36%) or additional Mg2+ (0.52 g/L), or both. The pups were maintained on standard rat chow through adulthood, and ventricular myocytes were isolated and stimulated to contract at 0.5 Hz. Mechanical properties were evaluated using an IonOptix soft-edge system, and intracellular Ca2+ transients were measured as changes in fura-2 fluorescence intensity (DELTAFFI). Offspring from all groups displayed similar growth curves. Myocytes from the ethanol group exhibited reduced cell length, enhanced peak shortening (PS), and shortened time to 90% relengthening (TR90) associated with a normal DELTAFFI and time to PS (TPS). Mg2+ reverted the prenatal ethanol-induced alteration in PS and maximal velocity of relengthening. However, it shortened TPS and TR90, and altered the DELTAFFI, as well as Ca2+ decay rate by itself. Additionally, myocytes from the ethanol group exhibited impaired responsiveness to increased extracellular Ca 2+ or stimulating frequency, which were restored by gestational Mg2+ supplementation. These data suggest that although gestational Mg2+ supplementation may be beneficial to certain cardiac contractile dysfunctions in offspring of alcoholic mothers, caution must be taken, as Mg2+ supplementation affects cell mechanics itself.

N2  - A fostering/crossfostering analysis of the effects of maternal ethanol exposure on lactation performance and offspring growth was performed. Wistar rats were kept under one of the three experimental nutritional treatments: alcohol-treated (EG), pairfed-treated (PFG) (as a nutritional control of alcohol-associated malnutrition), and control or normal diet (CG). Rats from the EG group were accustomed to increased amounts of ethanol (5 % during the first week to 20 % in the fourth week). The 20 % ethanol level was maintained throughout three additional weeks and during gestational and lactational period. Daily food intake, fluid consumption, body weight and gestational parameters were studied in control (CG), pairfed (PFG) and ethanol dams (EG). At birth, half the litters were fostered to other dams of the same treatment (GLG) and half were cross-fostered to dams of the opposite treatment (GG, LG). No crossfostering analyses were performed on the pair-fed group. Offspring body weight was controlled throughout lactation. Liver, kidney and spleen weights as well as milk consumption were also studied at the end of lactation period. In dams, a significant reduction of body weight was described throughout the suckling period. No ethanol detrimental effects were observed on body weight at birth, but in spite of a normal birth weight, alcohol during lactation was responsible for a growth deficit. Milk consumption was significantly reduced in offspring exposed to ethanol during gestation and/or lactation. Curiously, prenatal alcohol exposure affects adversely the suckling behaviour in pups at the time of weaning. In our study, alcohol treatment and malnutrition affects liver and spleen weights. However, malnutrition decreases spleen weights more than alcohol treatment. In the case of the kidney weights the alcohol decreases kidney weight more than malnutrition. Collectively, the data from the present study show similar effects following pre/postnatal and postnatal alcohol exposure. The findings suggest that chronic alcohol administration during gestation and/or lactation adversely affects pup growth at weaning as indicated by its effect on milk consumption, pup and organ weight.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - The effect of alcohol on maternal vascular adaptations to pregnancy is unknown. This study was designed to determine the effect of alcohol consumption on nitric oxide-mediated vascular function in mice during pregnancy. Female pregnant or nonpregnant C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet or a liquid diet of 25% ethanol-derived calories for 13 days (from gestational days 6-18). Phenylephrine vasoconstriction was blunted in pregnancy compared with the nonpregnant state due to enhanced nitric oxide modulation, which was impaired by ethanol exposure. Although the EC50 and maximal responses to methacholine were not different in nonpregnant vs. pregnant mice, the nitric oxide component to methacholine-induced vasorelaxation was greater in the pregnant mice. Interestingly, alcohol affected only the pregnant animals in their response to methacholine. These data indicate that alcohol reduced the nitric oxide modulation of vascular response, which was more pronounced during pregnancy. These studies provide novel information regarding the effects of alcohol on the maternal vascular system during pregnancy and thereby contribute to further understanding of the adverse effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Although high-dose prenatal alcohol exposure is related to cognitive and behavioral impairments in children and adolescents with fetal alcohol syndrome, there is relatively little research on the effects of moderate drinking during pregnancy. We examined learning, memory, and behavior in adolescent rhesus monkeys prenatally exposed to moderate levels of alcohol, psychological stress, or both alcohol and stress. Methods: Forty adolescent rhesus monkey subjects were derived from four groups of female rhesus monkeys that (1) consumed alcohol throughout gestation; (2) experienced prenatal stress; (3) experienced prenatal stress and alcohol consumption; or (4) control group (no alcohol, no stress). The subjects were assessed for number of trials required to reach 90% criterion of correct responses on nonmatching-tosample task (NMS), followed by trials with delays of 30, 60, or 120 sec. Ratings of behavior during testing were made after each session. Results: Subjects exposed to moderate prenatal alcohol required significantly more trials to reach criterion on the acquisition phase of the NMS task but had no difficulty with delays. Prenatally stressed monkeys showed lower response inhibition or less behavioral restraint, whereas prenatal alcohol plus stress monkeys showed higher activity level and stereotypies compared with controls. High scores on neonatal measures of orientation (attending to novel stimuli) and motor maturity and low scores on irritability, activity, stereotypies, and impulsivity during acquisition were correlated with fewer trials to criterion on acquisition of NMS. Conclusions: NMS trials required to reach criterion and behavior during testing are sensitive to moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure in monkeys. The most adverse behavioral outcomes (hyperactivity and stereotypies) were associated with prenatal alcohol plus stress, raising concerns that environmental stress might provide the context within which fetal alcohol exposure could promote adverse behavioral outcomes. These effects occurred in the absence of either facial deformities or retarded physical growth.

A1  - Hobbins J.C.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Whether prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with a reduction in the frontal cortex was examined. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women (n = 167) received multiple ultrasonographic assessments. During the assessment, brain structures were visualized and measured, including the distance from the posterior margin of the cavum to the calvarium, the distance from the posterior margin of the thalamus to the calvarium, the transcerebellar diameter, and the biparietal diameter. RESULTS: Regression analyses and odds ratios demonstrated that alcohol exposure was associated with a reduction in the frontal cortex, but not other brain structures. Strikingly, the percent of fetuses with a frontal cortex below the 10th percentile increased from 4% for nonexposed fetuses to 23% for heavily exposed fetuses. CONCLUSION: There was a relationship between frontal brain size and maternal alcohol consumption, suggesting that ultrasonography may be a sensitive tool for detecting alcohol-induced changes in the fetal brain.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters the liver and induces pathological changes in the morphology and function of the Golgi apparatus (GA), including an accumulation or reduced transport of newly synthesized glycoconjugates which suggests that ethanol could affect the cytoskeleton (CSK) in hepatocytes. To test this possibility we have analysed, using various techniques, the effect of ethanol "in utero" on several CSK proteins including actin, alpha- tubulin, cytokeratin, vimentin and the motor associated proteins dynein and kinesin. Our results show that this treatment increases the amount of both alpha-tubulin and cytokeratin and alters its distribution.

N2  - PURPOSE: Heavy maternal drinking during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome, but whether more moderate alcohol consumption is associated with such adverse pregnancy outcomes as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) remains controversial. METHODS: Using data from a case-control study, we examined the association between maternal alcohol consumption and risk for IUGR among 701 case and 336 control infants born during 1993-1995 in Monroe County, New York. RESULTS: Our results provide no evidence of an independent association between moderate maternal alcohol consumption (<14 drinks per week) and risk for IUGR. The risk for IUGR among heavy drinkers (>14 drinks per week) around the time of conception was OR = 1.4 (95% CI 0.7-2.6) for IUGR < 5th percentile and OR = 1.4 (95% CI 0.7-2.8) for IUGR 5th-10th percentile. For heavy drinkers during the first trimester, the OR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.4-4.5) for IUGR < 5th percentile and OR = 1.3 (95% CI 0.4-4.8) for IUGR 5th-10th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: Since IUGR is a heterogeneous outcome with a possible multifactorial origin, further studies are needed to examine the combined effects of alcohol and other environmental and genetic factors on IUGR risk for subgroups of IUGR. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Background: Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits in nonhuman primate offspring. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of gestational timing of alcohol exposure on neurobehavior with a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Sixty-three rhesus monkey infants (Macaca mulatta), from four groups of females, were assessed: (1) an early alcohol-exposed group, in which mothers voluntarily consumed alcohol on gestational days 0 through 50; (2) a mid to late gestation alcohol-exposed group, in which mothers consumed an identical dose on gestation days 50 through 135; (3) a continuous-exposure group, in which mothers consumed an identical dose on days 0 through 135 or days 0 through 165; and (4) controls, in which mothers voluntarily consumed an isocaloric control solution on gestational days 0 through 50, 50 through 135, 0 through 135, or 0 through 165. Data were obtained on offspring for measures of growth and neurobehavior. Results: There were no effects of alcohol on birthweight, gestation length, or ponderal index. Prenatal exposure to alcohol during early gestation significantly decreased scores on infant neurobehavioral tests overall in multivariate tests, after controlling for birthweight. Univariate tests showed that early gestation alcohol exposure was related to reductions in infant orientation and motor maturity. Mid- to late-gestation exposure also resulted in a reduction in motor maturity but did not affect overall neurobehavioral performance in the multivariate tests. Conclusions: Early-gestation alcohol exposure is as deleterious to neonatal neurobehavior as late-gestation or continuous exposure. Moreover, neurobehavior seems to be a more sensitive marker of early-gestation moderate alcohol exposure than growth parameters. Women who are attempting to become pregnant should minimize frequent social drinking, because subtle neurodevelopmental effects to the fetus may be induced before pregnancy is detected.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose was to demonstrate that an objective, multivariate case definition of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) can be derived by means of craniofacial anthropometry. Study design: Craniofacial measurements (n = 21) were taken of 100 individuals who had been exposed to alcohol before birth (41 FAS, 59 PFAS) and 31 members of a control group. Multivariate discriminant analysis was used to identify craniofacial measurements that best differentiated the 3 groups (FAS, PFAS, and control). Results: Both the FAS and PFAS groups had a unique craniofacial phenotype that could be accurately discriminated from that of the control group. Stepwise discriminant analysis identified 6 craniofacial measurements that could differentiate individuals with and without prenatal alcohol exposure with 96% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 90% specificity. Conclusions: individuals with FAS and PFAS have a distinctive facial phenotype that can be characterized anthropometrically. The phenotypic case definition could be used as a screening tool to identify individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol who do not exhibit a "classic" FAS phenotype but exhibit a more subtle craniofacial dysmorphia.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - It is not known why some heavy-drinking women give birth to children with alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) whereas others do not. The objective of this study was to determine whether the frequency of elevated maternal blood acetaldehyde levels among alcoholics is in the range of ARBD among alcoholic women. MEDLINE was searched from 1980 to 2000 using the key words acetaldehyde, pharmacokinetics, and alcoholism for controlled trials reporting blood or breath acetaldehyde levels in alcoholics and nonalcoholics. Separately, using the key words fetal alcohol syndrome, epidemiology, prevalence, incidence, and frequency, articles were identified reporting ARBD incidences among the offspring of heavy drinkers. Of 23 articles reporting acetaldehyde levels in alcoholics, four met the inclusion criteria. Forty-three studies reported on the rate of ARBD in heavy drinkers, and 14 were accepted. Thirty-four percent of heavy drinkers had a child with ARBD, and 43% of chronic alcoholics had high acetaldehyde levels. The similar frequencies of high acetaldehyde levels among alcoholics and the rates of ARBD among alcoholic women provide epidemiologic support to the hypothesis that acetaldehyde may play a major role in the cause of ARBD.

N2  - Background: Abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC) have been documented in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), ranging from subtle decrements in its size to partial and even complete agenesis. Prenatal exposure to alcohol is also known to result in neurocognitive deficits. Objective: To 1) investigate abnormalities in size, shape, and location of the CC within the brain in individuals with FAS and in those exposed to high amounts of alcohol prenatally but without FAS (PEA group); and 2) determine if there is a relationship between callosal dysmorphology and cognitive test performance. Methods: MRI and novel surface-based image analytic methods were used. Twenty alcohol-exposed subjects (8 to 22 years) along with 21 normal controls (8 to 25 years) were studied with high-resolution MRI and measures of verbal learning and visuospatial abilities. Results: In addition to callosal area reductions, most severe in the splenium, the CC is significantly displaced in patients exposed to alcohol prenatally. In the alcohol-exposed group, this structure lies more anterior and inferior in posterior regions with relatively normal localization of anterior regions. These findings are significant in the FAS group, and a similar but less severe pattern is observed in the PEA patients. The authors show that the amount of CC displacement is correlated with impairment in verbal learning ability and that CC displacement is a better predictor of verbal learning than regional CC area. The brain-behavior relationship is only significant within the alcohol-exposed group, and the effect is not solely mediated by overall impaired verbal intellectual functioning. Conclusions: These results further emphasize the vulnerability of midline brain structures to prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Although the mechanisms that underlie fetal alcohol-induced neuronal loss have not been determined, hypoxia/hypoxemia has been considered a leading candidate. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that neuronal loss could occur in the developing brain in the absence of fetal hypoxemia. Methods: Three groups of pregnant sheep were used: a control group, a binge-drinking group, and a pair-fed group. The alcohol and pair-fed animals were anesthetized on day 113 of pregnancy, and the mothers and fetuses were instrumented with arterial and venous catheters. All animals were killed on day 133. Stereological cell counting techniques were used to estimate the total number of Purkinje cells in the fetal cerebellum. Results: Peak maternal and fetal blood alcohol concentrations did not produce fetal hypoxemia. Nevertheless, there was a 25 % loss of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in the alcohol-exposed fetuses compared with that in the pair-fed controls. The loss of neurons was not accompanied by microencephaly or a concomitant decrease in either cerebellar weight or volume of the fetal cerebellum. Conclusions: Neuronal loss can be observed after alcohol exposure during the third trimester equivalent in fetal sheep in the absence of alcohol-induced hypoxemia. Furthermore, cell loss in the absence of deficits in gross brain weight or regional brain volume indicates that the lack of gross brain volume deficits from magnetic resonance imaging techniques is not a reliable indication that the brain is unaffected by the alcohol exposure.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts motor performance in affected offspring. The ventrolateral nucleus (VLN) of the thalamus functions to relay information between the cerebellum and motor cortex. Reductions in the size of the thalamus have been found in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, and therefore a rat model system was used to determine whether VLN size and neuronal number were altered by alcohol exposure during development. Methods: Rat pups were exposed to alcohol in utero during the first 10 days of gestation (first trimester equivalent), the second 10 days of gestation (second trimester equivalent), or the first two trimesters equivalent combined. Some pups were exposed to alcohol in utero during the time of VLN neurogenesis. In addition, offspring from some of the dams treated during the first two trimesters equivalent were reared artificially from postnatal day (P) 4 through P9 (part of the third trimester equivalent) and received binge-like alcohol during this time, resulting in offspring exposed to alcohol during all three trimesters equivalent. Other offspring from untreated dams were reared in the same manner but received alcohol only during the third trimester equivalent. Control animals (nutritional and untreated) were reared for all treatment conditions. All pups were perfused on P10. Results: A unique effect of alcohol treatment was not found for the VLN volume or the number of neural cells within the VLN. However, the period of VLN neurogenesis was found to be sensitive to both alcohol and nutritional control treatments, resulting in significant decreases in the VLN volume and neural cell number. Conclusions: Motor deficits seen in offspring exposed prenatally to alcohol do not seem to result from direct effects on the structure of the VLN of the thalamus.

N2  - Two peptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (ADNF-9)], that are associated with novel glial proteins regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, are shown now to provide protective intervention in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal demise and growth restrictions were produced after intraperitoneal injection of ethanol to pregnant mice during midgestation (E8). Death and growth abnormalities elicited by alcohol treatment during development are believed to be associated, in part, with severe oxidative damage. NAP and ADNF-9 have been shown to exhibit antioxidative and antiapoptotic actions in vitro. Pretreatment with an equimolar combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities. Pretreatment with NAP alone resulted in a significant decrease in alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas ADNF-9 alone had no detectable effect on fetal survival after alcohol exposure, indicating a pharmacological distinction between the peptides. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with 1-h post-alcohol administration. Bioavailability studies with [3H]NAPVSIPQ indicated that 39% of the total radioactivity comigrated with intact peptide in the fetus 60 min after administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.

N2  - Objective: Executive function deficits, including verbal fluency, have been documented in children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure. Whereas nonverbal fluency impairments have been reported in adults with such exposure, these abilities have not been tested in children. Deficits in both verbal and nonverbal fluency were predicted and assessed in children and adolescents with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Method: There was a total of 28 (54% female) sub children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with (n = 10) and without (n = 8) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were compared to nonexposed controls (n = 10) on the design and verbal fluency measures from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System. Both fluency measures consist of three conditions, including a new set-shifting task. All tests require the generation of multiple responses within both rule and time constraints. Results: Data were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance and hierarchical regression analyses. Compared to controls, children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with and without FAS displayed deficits in both fluency domains, but did not differ from each other. In addition, prenatal alcohol exposure was a significant predictor of performance on the set-shifting design fluency task above and beyond performance on more traditional fluency tasks. IQ was not a significant predictor for the traditional or set-shifting fluency measures, whereas diagnostic group remained a significant predictor when IQ was included in the model. Conclusions: This study adds to the literature on the integrity of executive functions in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, documenting fluency impairment in both verbal and nonverbal domains. It is important to note that these impairments were demonstrated in higher functioning alcohol-exposed children, both with and without FAS, and that diagnostic group explained such deficiencies above and beyond general intellectual ability.

N2  - The association between deficits in emotion-related learning, conceptual set shifting, and behavioral problems was investigated in individuals with substantial prenatal alcohol exposure. Twenty subjects with confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (10 of whom were diagnosed as having Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) and 20 normal controls matched for age, gender, and ethnic background participated. The two groups were administered a battery of tests including two tests of emotion-related learning (visual discrimination reversal and extinction of reward-response associations), tests of conceptual set shifting and intellectual ability, and behavioral measures. The alcohol-exposed group made fewer reversals than the control group in visual discrimination reversal and exhibited more variability in extinction. These group differences remained significant after controlling for intellectual ability and conceptual set shifting. Variability in extinction and two measures of set shifting, perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and omission errors on reversal learning, were found to be robust predictors of parent-rated behavioral problems.

T1  - Pregnancy and drinking: "If it burns going down...": How focus groups can shape fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) prevention
A1  - Branco E.I.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Despite public health campaigns and clinical interventions that encourage women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy, some women continue to drink while pregnant. To provide a more in-depth understanding of how at-risk women regard - and emotionally react to - warnings about drinking alcohol during pregnancy, we conducted focus groups in 1997 with 11 pregnant and recent postpartum Native American and African American women in Los Angeles, California. The main objective of these groups was to uncover relevant aspects of women's beliefs and opinions about drinking during pregnancy that may not have been elicited by other research instruments. Results would then be used to shape a large survey of pregnant at-risk women. Analysis of the transcripts revealed three emergent themes, which had the greatest impact on our subsequent survey. These were women's exposure to and perceived believability of messages, their perception of risk associated with drinking, and the barriers to cutting down on alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Questions added to our survey instrument because of these findings included whether women think that some alcohol beverages are safer to drink than others; how they value cutting back alcohol use; their views on the irreversibility of fetal alcohol syndrome; and what pressures they feel from peers and family to drink during pregnancy. Given the small sample size associated with focus groups, these results cannot be generalized to larger populations however, these women's words revealed important underlying issues and barriers that should be considered in studying and intervening with larger representative samples.

T1  - Measuring the facial phenotype of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure: Correlations with brain dysfunction
A1  - Astley S.J.
A1  - Clarren S.K.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - The purpose of this report is to demonstrate how to measure the magnitude of expression of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) facial phenotype using the new 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and the previously developed D-score and to demonstrate how these two measures of the FAS facial phenotype correlate with brain function and structure; correlations that fail to be identified by the older gestalt method of facial measurement. The D-score and the facial component of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code quantitatively measure the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype using three facial features (palpebral fissure length, philtrum smoothness, and upper lip thinness). These facial measurement systems were developed by the Washington State FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN) of clinics and are used to screen and diagnose the facial component of FAS for all patients evaluated in the network of clinics (1500 to date). The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code is a comprehensive diagnostic system developed by the FAS DPN in 1997 to diagnose the full spectrum of outcomes among patients with prenatal alcohol exposure. The four digits reflect the magnitude of expression of the four key diagnostic features of FAS in the following order: (1) growth deficiency; (2) the FAS facial phenotype; (3) brain dysfunction; (4) gestational alcohol exposure. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code was developed to overcome the subjective, highly variable gestalt method of diagnosis that has been used as the standard to date, worldwide. Prior to the development of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the first 445 patients evaluated in the FAS DPN were diagnosed using the gestalt method. For research purposes, their gestalt diagnoses were transformed into 4-Digit Diagnostic Codes, presenting a unique opportunity to directly compare the two diagnostic methods. When the facial phenotype was measured using the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code or D-score, the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype was significantly correlated with structural, neurologic, and functional measures of brain damage, and the phenotype of those receiving a 4-Digit Diagnosis of FAS showed little variability. When the gestalt method of diagnosis was used, the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype did not correlate with structural, neurologic and functional measures of brain damage, and the facial phenotype of those receiving a gestalt diagnosis of FAS was highly variable. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and D-score thus provide more precise and accurate measures of the FAS facial phenotype and reveal important correlations with brain structure and function, suggesting that intermediate expressions of the FAS facial phenotype may serve as important risk factors for brain damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - ADH2 and CYP2E1 genetic polymorphisms: Risk factors for alcohol-related birth defects
A1  - Gail McCarver D.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Considerable variation in offspring outcome occurs following intrauterine ethanol exposure. The mechanism underlying this varying susceptibility may involve genetic differences in ethanol metabolism catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). A recent population study demonstrated a protective role for the ADH-beta3 isoform, which is encoded by ADH2*3, an allele unique to African Americans. Drinking during pregnancy was associated with lower scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant Developmental Mental Index (MDI), but only in the offspring of mothers without an ADH2*3 allele. Lower MDI scores were associated with the three-way interaction among increasing ethanol intake and maternal and offspring absence of the ADH2*3 allele (p < 0.01, analysis of variance, model r2 = 0.09). The protection afforded by this allele is likely secondary to its encoding of the high Km, high Vmax ADH-beta3 isoenzyme, which would provide more efficient ethanol metabolism at high blood ethanol concentrations. However, the small amount of variance accounted for by the ADH2 polymorphism suggests that other genetic and/or environmental factors are also determinants of offspring risk. We recently described a 96-bp insertion polymorphism in the CYP2E1 regulatory region that is associated with enhanced CYP2E1 metabolic ability in the presence of ethanol intake or obesity, conditions associated with CYP2E1 induction (p < 0.01, both). The frequency of the insertion varies across ethnic groups, occurring in about 30% of African Americans and 7% of Caucasians (p < 0.01), and is sufficiently common to impact susceptibility to alcohol-related birth defects. Thus, genetic differences in ADH and CYP2E1 are likely determinants of offspring risk.

N2  - Our previous studies revealed abnormalities on structural MRI (sMRI) in small groups of children exposed to alcohol prenatally. Microcephaly, disproportionately reduced basal ganglia volume, and abnormalities of the cerebellar vermis and corpus callosum were demonstrated. The present study used sMRI to examine in detail the regional pattern of brain hypoplasia resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol using a higher resolution imaging protocol and larger sample sizes than reported previously. Fourteen participants (mean 11.4 years; eight females, six males) with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 12 participants (mean 14.8 years; four females, eight males) with prenatal exposure to alcohol (PEA) but without the facial features of FAS were compared to a group of 41 control participants (mean 12.8 years, 20 females, 21 males). Findings of significant microcephaly and disproportionately reduced basal ganglia volumes in the FAS group were confirmed. Novel findings were that in FAS participants, white matter volumes were more affected than gray matter volumes in the cerebrum, and parietal lobes were more affected than temporal and occipital lobes. Among subcortical structures, in contrast to the disproportionate effects on caudate nucleus, the hippocampus was relatively preserved in FAS participants. Differences between the PEA group and controls were generally non-significant; however, among a few of the structures most affected in FAS participants, there was some evidence for volume reduction in PEA participants as well, specifically in basal ganglia and the parietal lobe. There were no group differences in cerebral volume asymmetries. Severe prenatal alcohol exposure appears to produce a specific pattern of brain hypoplasia.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Women who abuse alcohol during pregnancy may deliver offspring who could be diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or a less severe deficit involving cognitive and behavioral disorders. The severity of the deficits may involve the interaction of several known risk factors, such as alcohol consumption pattern or duration, the timing of alcohol consumption relative to critical windows of vulnerability, or the inherent differential vulnerability among the various brain regions to alcohol-induced brain injury. In this study, we explore the vulnerability of the different brain regions by making cell counts from multiple brain regions. Specifically, we used stereological cell-counting techniques to estimate the total cell numbers in the cerebellum (Purkinje and granule cells), olfactory bulb (mitral and granule cells), hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 cells), and dentate gyrus (granule cells). Groups of timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of five treatments: alcohol by intragastric intubation (2.25, 4.5, or 6.5 g/kg/day), nutritional control [pairfed and intubated=Pairfed) and intubated], and normal control (Chow). Treatments began on embryonic day 1 (E1) and continued through E20. On E33 (usually postnatal day 10), all offspring were perfused intracardially with saline followed by fixatives. Representative forebrains, cerebella, and olfactory bulb from each group were processed for cell counting. The optical dissector was used to obtain cell densities, while Cavalieri's principle was used to calculate the reference volume. The product of density and volume gave unbiased estimates of the total neuronal number within each brain region. Overall peak BACs (regardless of sampling day) for the three alcohol groups averaged 136, 290, and 422 mg/dl for the 2.25-, 4.5-, and 6.5-g/kg groups, respectively. The total number of cerebellar Purkinje cells was reduced in the 6.5-g/kg group relative to controls, while the total number of olfactory bulb mitral cells and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells from all alcohol-treated groups was not different from controls. Total numbers of granule neurons were reduced in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb of offspring exposed to 4.5 or 6.5 g/kg/day, but granule cell numbers in the dentate gyrus were not affected by the prenatal alcohol treatment. Taken together with previous findings, these data demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure results in regional vulnerability of various brain structures and underscores the variability of deleterious effects of alcohol on brain development.

N2  - Alcohol abuse by pregnant women can result in fetal alcohol effects (FAE) and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Both ethanol itself and its main metabolite, acetaldehyde (Ach), are able to produce specific FAS-related malformations. In previous in vitro studies, we documented that 10-day-old rat embryos exposed to Ach show a characteristic embryonic Ach syndrome, histologically characterized by marked cellular death. As both necrosis and pathological apoptosis are teratological mechanisms, the aim of this work was to evaluate if cellular death, observed in Ach-exposed embryos, can be related to necrotic or apoptotic events. Ten-day-old rat embryos were cultured in the presence of Ach 30-60 mug/ml and stained with the vital dye acridine orange to visualize apoptotic areas. After fixation, the TUNEL [3' terminal deoxynucleotide tranferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling] method was used to histologically identify apoptosis. Both acridine orange and TUNEL staining showed signs of physiological apoptosis in controls and abnormal apoptotic regions in Ach-exposed embryos. Our results show a clear correlation between malformed organs and apoptotic embryonic districts, suggesting the role of apoptosis in Ach-induced abnormalities. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Affective prosody is a nonlinguistic aspect of language that conveys emotion and attitude during discourse. It is a dominant function of the right hemisphere. Because skills associated with the right hemisphere have been found to be impaired in alcoholics, this study explored the possibility that affective prosodic functioning may be sensitive to the effects of alcohol due to heavy persistent drinking or prenatal exposure. Methods: Subjects were aged 25 to 58 years. Twenty-nine men and three women who met DSM-IV criteria for an alcohol use disorder with a median of 39 days of sobriety, 11 men with a probable history of fetal alcohol exposure (FAexp), and 41 age-matched control subjects of both sexes were tested by using the Aprosodia Battery. This instrument assesses affective prosodic comprehension (APC) across a range of verbal articulatory demands. Results: The alcoholic group scored 2 SD below the control mean, and the FAexp group scored -5 SD regardless of whether they had ever been diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Despite their poor performance on APC, alcoholic and FAexp groups performed similarly to the control group on vocabulary, abstract reasoning, and an index of cognitive impairment that used the Shipley Institute of Living Scale. Multiple regression analyses that used nine alcohol use variables to model APC resulted in four significant contributors to the effect. These regressors were related to early exposure to ethanol and chronicity of alcohol abuse. Conclusions: Alcoholics and FAexp subjects were significantly less accurate at APC compared with controls. These alcohol-exposed subjects appear to be deficient in the ability to understand emotional valence in the speech of others, which results in errors of judgment that may impair social interactions.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - We model experience-dependent plasticity in the cortical representation of whiskers (the barrel cortex) in normal adult rats, and in adult rats that were prenatally exposed to alcohol. Prenatal exposure to alcohol (PAE) caused marked deficits in experience-dependent plasticity in a cortical barrel-column. Cortical plasticity was induced by trimming all whiskers on one side of the face except two. This manipulation produces high activity from the intact whiskers that contrasts with low activity from the cut whiskers while avoiding any nerve damage. By a computational model, we show that the evolution of neuronal responses in a single barrel-column after this sensory bias is consistent with the synaptic modifications that follow the rules of the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) theory. The BCM theory postulates that a neuron possesses a moving synaptic modification threshold, M, that dictates whether the neuron's activity at any given instant will lead to strengthening or weakening of its input synapses. The current value of M changes proportionally to the square of the neuron's activity averaged over some recent past. In the model of alcohol impaired cortex, the effective M has been set to a level unattainable by the depressed levels of cortical activity leading to "impaired" synaptic plasticity that is consistent with experimental findings. Based on experimental and computational results, we discuss how elevated M may be related to (i) reduced levels of neurotransmitters modulating plasticity, (ii) abnormally low expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), and (iii) the membrane translocation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in adult rat cortex subjected to prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Incomplete neural tube fusion (iNTF), induced by alcohol, in midline floor and roof plates was found in our recent study. In this study, serotonin (5-HT) neurons, known to be born entirely in the midline raphe at brainstem, were examined during their development with fetal alcohol exposure. Weight-matched C57BL mice pregnant dams were divided into three groups on E8: one received ethanol via a chocolate Sustacal liquid diet providing 20% ethanol-derived calories as the sole source of nutrients (ALC); the second received an isocaloric Sustacal liquid diet and was pair-fed to individual dams in the ethanol-fed group (PF); the third was fed ad lib rat chow (Chow). Fetal brains were obtained on E15 and were processed for immunostaining of 5-HT and its trophic factor, S100beta. The ascending 5-HT neurons, in normal development, appear bilaterally near midline on E12, and by E15, as seen in chow and PF groups, migrate from the midline germinal zone laterally and dorsally to their final position with rich fibers. In contrast, in the E15 ALC group, many 5-HT-im neurons were found remaining in the midline germinal region or had migrated, but with under-differentiated, sparse fibers. There were 20-30% fewer 5-HT-im neurons in ALC as compared to PF and Chow. In addition, the number of S100beta cells was less in ALC as compared with PF and Chow groups. No difference was found between PF and Chow in number of 5-HT-im or S100beta-im cells. The 5-HT neurons found compromised in migration and differentiation may, in part, stem from failure of access to floor plate or midline tissue induction and the insufficient support by S100beta. As 5-HT neurons have been implicated for signaling brain maturation, fewer 5-HT neurons may have lasting effects on the development of brain or, if persistent in the adult, profoundly affect adult brain function. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

T1  - Identifying maternal self-reported alcohol use associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
A1  - Barr H.M.
A1  - Streissguth A.P.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: The incidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) has been estimated at 1 to 3 per 1000 live births. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) (which include FAS) are estimated to occur in about 1 in 100 births. Cessation of drinking during pregnancy can improve the outcome even if the unborn child is already affected. For individuals born with FASD, an early diagnosis appears to be a protective factor against secondary disabilities. A quick screening tool to identify newborn children at risk has been elusive. Methods: A simple descriptive presentation is offered that shows where 36 individuals with FASD were found from among the many patterns and amounts of prenatal alcohol use that were reported by a sample of 1439 pregnant women whose offspring were later examined within the first 7 years of life. Results: Individuals with FASD (i.e., those with FAS, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder) were found within two aggregates of alcohol scores that together recommend a set of three to four alcohol questions. Within this derivation sample, one scoring of the questions yields almost 78% sensitivity and 97% specificity for FASD. Another scoring of the same instrument yields 100% sensitivity with 90% specificity. Conclusions: These new data may facilitate early identification of offspring who may be most in need of early intervention, namely those born with FASD.

N2  - Background: Epilepsy is a prominent sign of neurologic dysfunction in some children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, it is unknown whether the epileptic disorders in these children are directly due to the neuroteratogenic effects of alcohol or to some other factor accompanying maternal alcoholism. The hippocampus is vulnerable to alcohol-induced pathologic changes, and dysfunction of the hippocampus often manifests as epilepsy. We examined the effect of alcohol exposure during development on the seizure threshold and examined the relationship between alteration of seizure threshold and alcohol-induced neuronal loss from the hippocampus. Methods: Rat pups received 0.85, 2.5, or 3.75 g/kg of alcohol via intragastric intubation daily over postnatal days (PD) 4-9. An intubated control and a suckle control group were also included. To assess the effect of a single day of alcohol exposure, an additional group received 3.75 g/kg of alcohol on PD 4 alone. Behavioral seizure thresholds were determined by intravenous infusion of the proconvulsant, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), on PD 31 or on PD 90. In addition, electrographic seizure thresholds were determined by recording extracellular field potentials from the dentate gyrus. The number of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, CA3 pyramidal cells, and granule cells of the dentate gyrus were determined by stereology. Results: Daily exposure to alcohol resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the seizure threshold and in the selective loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. Reduction in the seizure threshold was significantly correlated with loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. Recordings of extracellular field potentials confirmed the alcohol-induced reduction in seizure threshold, demonstrated that PTZ-induced seizures involve hippocampal-parahippocampal circuitry, and provided evidence that the hippocampal formation is the generator of the PTZ-induced seizures in alcohol-exposed animals. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that exposure of the developing brain to alcohol can permanently reduce the threshold for both behavioral and electrographic seizures and can selectively kill hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Both the pathologic findings and the physiologic recordings support the concept that the reduced seizure threshold in alcohol-exposed animals is due to hippocampal pathology.

N2  - Background: Understanding the basis for ethanol's teratogenic effects may inform the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome. Here we investigate how genetic background and susceptibility to ethanol-induced neural crest apoptosis contribute to the distinctive craniofacial phenotype observed after prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Nine different chick strains were exposed to ethanol at gastrulation. The sensitivity of these embryos to ethanol-induced neural crest apoptosis was reported elsewhere (Debelak and Smith, 2000). Here, these embryos were permitted to develop until embryonic day 10, when facial morphogenesis was largely complete, and cephalometric measurements were made on cleared skulls. Shifts in facial growth were correlated against the severity of ethanol-induced apoptosis in facial precursors. Results: The facial shape produced by ethanol exposure was a function of the embryos' genetic strain. Three general responses were observed: apparent midfacial flattening (Babcock B300 x Hampshire Red, ISA-Babcock, HyLine W98, and HyLine W36 strains), overall facial expansion (Spafas and Babcock B300 strains), or overall facial hypoplasia (DeKalb strains). When dose and timing of exposure were held constant, the embryo's genetic background predicted the facial outcome. For ethanol-sensitive strains, apoptosis of facial precursor populations was required to produce the facial defects. That some strains had essentially normal faces despite extensive cell death indicated a capacity to recover from the earlier neural crest losses. Conclusions: We propose that ethanol's effects on craniofacial development are multifactoral, and these influences may include susceptibility to apoptosis, regenerative capacity, and compensatory outgrowth of the facial primordia. The embryo's genetic background may modulate these events. The high and low responder chick strains are useful tools to dissect these contributions.

T1  - Effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on midsagittal commissure size in rats
A1  - Bower C.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol exposure in humans can cause a variety of brain and behavioral abnormalities. The brain abnormalities include defects in the corpus callosum that range from total absence (agenesis) to reduction in size or thickness. Determination of the critical alcohol level or time period of exposure to produce these effects is difficult because of the lack of control of possible mitigating factors. Methods: The present study was undertaken to examine possible relationships between midsagittal corpus callosum dimensions and prenatal alcohol level as measured by blood alcohol concentration, as well as prenatal period of exposure as measured by first- or second- or first- plus second-trimester equivalents in a rat model. In addition to the corpus callosum, the hippocampal and anterior commissures were also examined. Pregnant mothers were given a single daily dose of alcohol by intragastric gavage; four different doses were tested in different mothers. Peak blood alcohol concentration was determined at one of four hourly intervals thereafter. Control pregnant mothers were pairfed to individual alcohol treated mothers and handled accordingly, but no alcohol was given. Other controls consisted of normal, untreated pregnant mothers. Results: The results show all measures of corpus callosum and anterior commissure were not affected by any dose of alcohol during any time period. However, higher BAC levels during prolonged periods of alcohol exposure were associated with reduced size of the hippocampal commissure. Conclusions: The results suggest that additional experimental factors not included in the present study are responsible for the effects observed in humans. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - We have previously demonstrated that treatment of pregnant C57BL mice from gestation days 8 to 14 with alcohol with 20% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) reduced the number of serotonin (5-HT) neurons and retarded their migration in the fetal brains. In the present study, we obtained similar results with the use of 25% EDC and extended our previous findings by demonstrating that besides the alteration of the number of 5-HT neurons, prenatal alcohol exposure also affects their projecting fibers in their early development. Pregnant C57BL mice were divided into an alcohol-exposed (ALC) group given 25% EDC (4.49%, v/v), a pair-fed group to the ethanol-fed group (PF) and a chow-fed group (Chow). The PF and Chow groups served as controls. Our results showed that in the ALC group, when compared with the control groups, prenatal alcohol exposure with 25% EDC reduced the number of 5-HT-immunoreactive neurons in both the median and dorsal raphe, and the amount of 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). The diameter of the 5-HT-immunoreactive MFB was also reduced as a result of treatment. No significant differences of the above parameters were found between the PF and Chow groups. The previous and present work confirmed that alcohol reduces the normal formation and growth of 5-HT neurons in the midbrain. Furthermore, the projection of 5-HT fibers, in density as well as in distribution, is reduced in the major trajectory bundle. This may affect the amount of 5-HT fibers available to the forebrain. In light of the importance of the 5-HT system in brain development, alcohol may affect the growth of the forebrain through its effect on 5-HT signaling.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a whole spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) sequelae that persist throughout the life span and manifest in a spectrum of effects from clinically indistinguishable to severely impairing. The greatest impact of alcohol as a teratogen is to the brain-the greatest need is for holistic treatment and management of the associated mental disorders. The interaction of this subtle brain damage with the complex psychosocial circumstances surrounding the birth of a child to a mother with alcohol problems can further compound development and result in costly and devastating social consequences. Research is urgently needed on the chronic neuropsychiatric sequelae of these subtle birth defects of the brain. Identification of these fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in the psychiatric nomenclature is a necessary step to focus the attention and resources of the mental health field on this personally and socially significant problem.

T1  - An alternative to standard drinks as a measure of alcohol consumption
A1  - Kaskutas L.A.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Despite the field's longstanding concern with underreporting of alcohol consumption, traditional survey questions encourage error because respondents often must calculate their number of drinks based on standard drink sizes that often do not match their own drinking style. This study considered how often respondents' self-defined drink sizes matched a 'standard' drink size based on approximately 12 g of ethanol for six different beverages. We also studied whether respondents could accurately judge the size of their drinks. Subjects were recruited and interviewed at urban prenatal clinics, health clinics, and via snowball referrals and community outreach in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Because of the urgency of accurate measurement of consumption during pregnancy, urban pregnant women from the groups most at risk for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Native Americans (n = 102) and African Americans (185), were targeted. A small comparison group of urban pregnant white women (n = 34) was included. One-hour in-person interviews were conducted. Self-defined drink sizes were determined for each beverage consumed, using models and photographs of vessels. Frequent drinkers and the majority of women who reported drinking higher alcohol content beverages reported drinking larger-than-standard drink sizes. The median size of a malt liquor drink among the daily drinkers was almost three times as large as the standard, their fortified wine drinks were four times the standard, and their spirits drinks were six times the standard size. The majority of drinkers of each beverage were unable to accurately judge the size of their drinks, underestimating the number of fluid ounces by about 30%. Although the vessels methodology used here must be refined and tested further on other populations (e.g., men, nonpregnant women, and all ethnic groups), results suggest that determination of risk levels should be based on survey data that takes into consideration the beverage mix and the actual size of respondents' alcohol drinks.

T1  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most devastating. Recognizable by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities and growth deficiency, this condition includes severe alcohol-induced damage to the developing brain. FAS children experience deficits in intellectual functioning; difficulties in learning, memory, problem-solving, and attention; and difficulties with mental health and social interactions. An FAS diagnosis, however, fails to identify prenatal-alcohol-exposed children who lack the characteristic facial defects and growth deficiency of FAS. Nonetheless, these often undiagnosed children may still experience serious fetal alcohol effects (FAE), including alcohol-induced mental impairments (i.e., alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorder) or alcohol-related abnormalities of the skeleton and certain organ systems (i.e., alcohol-related birth defects). Neuroimaging techniques can assist researchers in identifying FAE through precise pictures of brain abnormalities in persons prenatally exposed to alcohol. By understanding the mechanisms underlying FAE and the behavioral manifestations of the resulting structural brain damage, researchers can ultimately develop effective FAS prevention strategies that identify and assist high-risk women at varying levels of pregnancy.

T1  - Reducing complications from alcohol use during pregnancy through screening
A1  - Morse B.A.
A1  - Hutchins E.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal providers are reluctant to discuss alcohol use in the clinical setting, even though heavy alcohol use is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), sometimes known as alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. Fourteen percent to 20% of pregnant women report drinking some alcohol during pregnancy. Approximately 0.2% to 1% meet the criteria for heavy drinking. Reducing drinking during pregnancy has the potential to reduce the risk for FAS and FAE. Routine screening for alcohol use during pregnancy followed by referrals for those considered to be at risk is recommended. Women are often more receptive to intervention during pregnancy, as they focus on positive health behaviors. A number of brief screening tools designed for use on a routine basis are reviewed. Physicians who learn to comfortably discuss alcohol use during pregnancy can help substantially reduce the impact of these disorders.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, mental retardation, and neurodevelopmental disorders. In 1973, a cluster of birth defects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure was recognized as a clinical entity called fetal alcohol syndrome. More recently, alcohol exposure in utero has been linked to a variety of other neurodevelopmental problems, and the terms alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects have been proposed to identify infants so affected. This statement is an update of a previous statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics and reflects the current thinking about alcohol exposure in utero and the revised nosology.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - PURPOSE: Fetal exposure to alcohol is a serious public health problem and is associated with anomalies of the eye ground, as well as neurodevelopmental delay, growth delay, and characteristic facial features. Our purpose is to report the incidence of abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) results in children with fetal alcohol syndrome and raise awareness of the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome in ophthalmology. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on the records of 11 children with the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. The results of the ophthalmologic examination, magnetic resonance imaging, visual acuity test, and ERG are reported. RESULTS: The magnetic resonance imaging results were abnormal in all subjects tested. The ophthalmology examination showed optic nerve hypoplasia in 91% of the subjects. Visual acuity was reduced in all but one subject. The ERG results were abnormal, showing reduced b-wave amplitude, increased a- and b-wave implicit time, reduced Rmax, and increased log (k). The scotopic ERG was more severely affected than the photopic ERG. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to changes in retinal function as evidenced by an abnormal ERG response. The ERG can therefore be a tool with which to identify suspected alcohol embryopathy.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a specific polydystrophic pattern of malformations with the following diagnostic criteria: 1. Maternal alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse during pregnancy. 2. Pre- and postnatal deficiency of growth in weight, height and head circumference. 3. Multiple minor and major anomalies recognizable mainly at a typical face. 4. Structural injuries and changes at the central nervous system with complex brain dysfunction combining elements of cognitive impairments, behavioral disturbance and neurological damage. Fetal alcohol effects (FAE) or so-called "alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders" (ARND) with predominant neurotoxic effects and a large spectrum of cerebral dysfunctions are manifold more frequent than the full-blown FAS. These remain mostly unrecognized, overlooked and they are difficult to be diagnosed, the symptoms being unspecific. Alcohol in pregnancy is nowadays the most important and the most frequent toxic substance for the embryo and the fetus and one of the most frequent causes of mental retardation. The longlasting and irreversible consequences refer to school development, social maturation, social behaviour and later life-style. The diagnosis is based on the careful maternal history and on the clinical findings; there are no biochemical parameters of assessment. The risk of addiction development in these children is assumed to be more than 20 percent.

N2  - Despite the field's longstanding concern with underreporting of alcohol consumption, traditional survey questions encourage error because respondents often must calculate their number of drinks based on standard drink sizes that often do not match their own drinking style. This study considered how often respondents' self-defined drink sizes matched a 'standard' drink size based on approximately 12 g of ethanol for six different beverages. We also studied whether respondents could accurately judge the size of their drinks. Subjects were recruited and interviewed at urban prenatal clinics, health clinics, and via snowball referrals and community outreach in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Because of the urgency of accurate measurement of consumption during pregnancy, urban pregnant women from the groups most at risk for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Native Americans (n=102) and African Americans (185), were targeted. A small comparison group of urban pregnant white women (n=34) was included. One-hour in-person interviews were conducted. Self-defined drink sizes were determined for each beverage consumed, using models and photographs of vessels. Frequent drinkers and the majority of women who reported drinking higher alcohol content beverages reported drinking larger-than-standard drink sizes. The median size of a malt liquor drink among the daily drinkers was almost three times as large as the standard, their fortified wine drinks were four times the standard, and their spirits drinks were six times the standard size. The majority of drinkers of each beverage were unable to accurately judge the size of their drinks, underestimating the number of fluid ounces by about 30%. Although the vessels methodology used here must be refined and tested further on other populations (e.g., men, nonpregnant women, and all ethnic groups), results suggest that determination of risk levels should be based on survey data that takes into consideration the beverage mix and the actual size of respondents' alcohol drinks. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Patients with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) often have difficulty functioning appropriately in everyday life and seem to employ poor problem-solving strategies. Tests of executive function are relevant for quantifying the functional deficits and underlying real-life problems associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This study considers two pathways for the effects of prenatal alcohol on executive function: a direct effect and an indirect effect through prenatal alcohol's effect on IQ. We compared 30 men who had been diagnosed with FAS or FAE with young adults participating in a longitudinal prospective study (n = 419) and 15 control participants that comprised a comparison group. This study is unique in its analysis of the same battery of assessments of executive function in both a large low dose longitudinal study sample and a clinically diagnosed group. Participants were evaluated on 9 tests (including 58 scores) of executive function. For some but not all of the tests in this executive function battery, the decrement in the alcohol exposure group is greater than would be predicted from their IQ scores. We found that 3 of 6 Stroop scores, 2 of 4 Trails scores, 9 of 16 Wisconsin Card Sorting scores, 1 of 2 Ruff's Figural Fluency scores, and 2 of 4 Consonant Trigrams scores appear to be particularly sensitive to the direct effects of prenatal alcohol damage for patients with FAS and FAE. The findings suggest that these executive function tests would be particularly useful in clinical evaluations of persons suspected of fetal alcohol damage because they would not simply reflect deficits in IQ or facial stigmata.

T1  - Prenatal exposure to moderate levels of ethanol can have long-lasting effects on learning and memory in adult offspring

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce long-lasting cognitive and learning impairments in children. Previous studies have suggested that prenatal ethanol exposure can produce neurochemical abnormalities in hippocampal formation. We examined whether performance in the Morris water task, known to be sensitive to interference with hippocampal function, would be affected in adult offspring of rat dams who consumed moderate levels of ethanol through pregnancy. Rat dams consumed one of three diets throughout gestation: (1) Bio-Serve liquid diet containing 5% ethanol (v/v; 26% EDC), which produces a maternal peak blood ethanol concentration of 100 mg/dl; (2) pair fed an isocalorically equivalent amount of 0% ethanol liquid diet; or (3) laboratory chow ad libitum. Adult offspring from each of the three maternal diet conditions were trained in one of three versions of the Morris water task. We employed the "standard" fixed hidden platform task, the moving platform task, and a task that measures competition between cue and place navigation. All three groups learned to navigate normally in the fixed hidden platform version and showed clear preferences for the goal location during no-platform probe trials. In contrast, in the moving platform version and the cue versus place competition task, the prenatally exposed rats were abnormal relative to the rats of the other two maternal diet conditions. In both of these tasks, they behaved in a manner consistent with the idea that acquisition of new place information does not proceed as effectively as in normal rats. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that hippocampal circuitry and neurochemistry related to synaptic plasticity are important targets underlying at least some of the long-lasting deleterious cognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure decreases the number of nitric oxide synthase positive neurons in rat superior colliculus and periaqueductal gray

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Because nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the development and refinement of axonal projections and synapses, it is of interest to know if developmental alcohol exposures affect NO producing neurons. Pregnant rats were fed artificial liquid diet throughout gestation as the only fluid or caloric source. The diet for experimental dams contained ethanol (6.7% v/v) while the pair-fed diet for control dams contained isocaloric maltose-dextrin instead of ethanol. This ethanol diet regime is known to produce peak blood alcohol concentrations of approximately 140 mg%. Cells stained histochemically for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were counted at postnatal day 15 (P15) and 35 (P35) in cross-sections of the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS) of the superior colliculus (SC) and in the dorsolateral column of the periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). Compared to control tissues, alcohol caused the following effects: In the SC, the areal density of NOS+ neurons was decreased 24% at P15 but a similar decrease in means at P35 was not statistically significant (P=0.10); soma size was unaffected at either P15 or P35. In the dlPAG, both the areal density and the total number of NOS+ neurons per section were unaffected at P15 but were decreased at P35 (33% and 37% decreases); soma size was unaffected at either P15 or P35. The decrease in NOS+ neurons in the SC at P15 could be expected to have a negative impact on the refinement of neuronal connections while the decreases in NOS+ neurons in the dlPAG at P35 likely represent more permanent effects that could alter the function of that nucleus.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt brain development and lead to a myriad of behavioral alterations, including motor coordination deficits, hyperactivity, and learning deficits. There remains a need, however, to identify treatments and interventions for reducing the severity of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. Some of the alcohol-induced deficits in learning may be related to alterations in cholinergic functioning. Interestingly, there is a growing literature demonstrating that pre- and/or early postnatal choline supplementation can lead to long-term enhancement in learning and memory and cholinergic activity in rats. The present study examined whether such early choline supplementation might counter the effects of prenatal alcohol treatment on a visuospatial discrimination task. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of three prenatal treatment groups. One group received a liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) from gestational day (GD) 6-20. A second group served as a pair-fed (PF) control group and the third group served as an ad lib lab chow (LC) control. On postnatal day (PD) 2, pups were assigned within-litter to one of three postnatal treatments: choline, saline vehicle, or no treatment. Choline and vehicle pups were intubated with a choline chloride solution or vehicle daily from PD 2 to 21, whereas the non-treated pups were handled daily but not intubated. On PD 45, subjects were tested on a visuospatial discrimination task. Ethanol-exposed subjects who were not treated neonatally with choline committed a significantly greater number of errors both during acquisition and during delayed discrimination training compared to both PF and LC controls. Neonatal choline treatment significantly improved performance on the discrimination task in all groups; however, the beneficial effects of choline were significantly larger in ethanol-exposed subjects. Indeed, the performance of ethanol-exposed pups treated with neonatal choline did not differ from any of the PF or LC groups on any measure. Thus, early postnatal choline supplementation significantly attenuated the effects of prenatal alcohol on this learning task. Importantly, these effects were not due to the acute effects of choline, but rather to long-term changes in brain and behavioral development. These data suggest that early dietary interventions may reduce the severity of fetal alcohol effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - The association between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and an increased incidence of teratogenic effects has been well established. The most severe manifestation of this effect is the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by craniofacial malformation, grown retardation and developmental disability in affected children. Estimates of prevalence at birth of FAS range from 0,4 to 3,1 per 1000 births, depending on population, race, socioeconomic status, etc. Incidence is considerably higher among alcoholic women: approximately 30-40% in infants of alcoholic mothers. The minimum daily alcohol intake that affects the fetus and the mechanism of alcohol's toxic effect on the fetus are not well understood, but many studies have contributed to the understanding of these important questions. The following review focuses on major recent findings in this field.

N2  - Objective: To examine the relative importance of prenatal exposure to cigarettes and alcohol and familial/genetic susceptibility for alcohol dependence in the etiology of childhood psychopathology. Method: A longitudinal prospective study of 150 children/adolescents (51.3% male), who were at either high or low risk for developing alcohol dependence because of their familial loading for alcoholism, provided multiple diagnostic assessments (N = 318) of these subjects. High-risk families were identified through the presence of two adult alcoholic sisters; low-risk control families were selected from the community. Annual assessments of offspring from these families included an in-depth psychiatric interview of each child and his/her parent to determine the presence or absence of childhood disorders. Mothers were interviewed concerning their prenatal use of substances, and information was gathered concerning their personal and familial loading for psychiatric disorders. Results: Using conventional logistic regression analyses, internalizing and externalizing disorders were found to be associated with familial loading for alcoholism and prenatal exposure to cigarettes and alcohol. In addition, a specialized statistical analysis, a multivariate confounder score approach, was conducted using familial risk status and the child's exposure to maternal prenatal use of alcohol and cigarettes. This analysis demonstrated that only one relationship between a single variable and a childhood disorder was significant while controlling for the other two variables: Oppositional disorder remained significant in association with familial risk status. Three additional analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of familial risk status, prenatal alcohol exposure and prenatal cigarette exposure on childhood psychopathology while controlling for two known risk factors (SES and parental ASPD) for externalizing disorders. Results of these analyses revealed that the only childhood disorder that was elevated was ADHD, and that this was the result of the familial risk variable only. Conclusions: Familial loading for alcohol dependence is an important risk factor for the development of childhood psychopathology and may account for the previously reported associations between prenatal exposure to nicotine and alcohol. Studies of substance abuse/dependence etiology and childhood psychopathology need to include consideration of both prenatal exposures and familial loading for alcohol dependence and other psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, mental retardation, and neurodevelopmental disorders. In 1973, a cluster of birth defects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure was recognized as a clinical entity called fetal alcohol syndrome. More recently, alcohol exposure in utero has been linked to a variety of other neurodevelopmental problems, and the terms alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects have been proposed to identify infants so affected. This statement is an update of a previous statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics and reflects the current thinking about alcohol exposure in utero and the revised nosology.

N2  - High levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy affect the development of the baby's central nervous system. Pregnant women were interviewed about their alcohol consumption during pregnancy, when they first visited the maternity hospital in Roubaix, France. Of the 698 women interviewed, 156 of their children were investigated at the age of 4 1/2 years with a standardised examination to assess the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurological status. Two scores were calculated: a posture score, which measured items while the child was standing; and a minor neurological signs score. The posture score was not related to prenatal alcohol exposure. consumption of 21 drinks/week (3 drinks/day) or more during pregnancy was significantly associated with a higher number of minor neurological signs, after controlling for relevant covariables. Although prenatal alcohol exposure was related to a lower General Cognitive Index (GCI), minor neurological signs were associated with prenatal alcohol exposure after controlling for GCI.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Background: This study examined the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and self-report of depressive symptoms in 5- to 6-year-old children. Higher levels of prenatal alcohol exposure were hypothesized to be associated with endorsement of a greater number of depressive symptoms in children. It was also hypothesized that maternal depression, although associated with drinking behavior, would contribute independently to outcome. Finally, the mother's behavior toward the child, as well as current drinking practices, were postulated to mediate the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and child depressive symptoms. Methods: Participants were 41 mother-child dyads who had been followed longitudinally since the children were 1 year of age. Self-report questionnaires for maternal and child depression were used. Results: Results revealed that prenatal alcohol exposure, maternal depression, and child gender seemed to be highly associated with child depressive symptoms. Girls who had higher levels of prenatal alcohol exposure and whose mothers acknowledged higher levels of depression endorsed the highest number of depressive symptoms. Neither the mother's behavior in interaction with the child nor her current level of alcohol consumption mediated the relationship. Conclusions: The importance of considering prenatal alcohol exposure as a risk variable in the prediction of childhood- onset depression and the possible neurological mechanisms underlying depression in children with alcohol exposure in utero are discussed.

N2  - Objective: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and less severe outcomes are typically diagnosed later in childhood, although earlier diagnosis of the effects of exposure would allow intervention in infancy and prevention of associated secondary disabilities. Identification is particularly difficult in such high-risk groups as low-birthweight infants. The goal of this study was to develop methods for early identification of at-risk infants. Method: Three methods (microcephaly, heavy episodic drinking [>5 drinks/occasion] in pregnancy and a cumulative risk index) identified neonates at risk for those developmental consequences of prenatal exposure that can be measured at 6 and 12 months (i.e., standard scores on Bayley Scales of Infant Development and growth measures). The usefulness of these methods was assessed by comparing those infants selected to an unexposed contrast group, while controlling for potentially confounding factors (e.g., race, socioeconomic status and birthweight). Results: At 6 months, when 70 infants were tested, trends were found for lower language facet scores and lower scores on the Behavioral Regulation Scale; at 12 months, when 134 were tested, alcohol-exposed infants had significantly lower cognitive facet scores (p < .02) and were more likely to be classified as either mildly or significantly developmentally delayed (p < .02). Conclusions: It is possible to identify infants at risk for alcohol- related developmental delays using information available in the neonatal period, although it is not usually done. Of the three methods tested, a cumulative risk index based on maternal characteristics was found to be most predictive.

T1  - Twelve-year follow-up of children exposed to alcohol in utero
A1  - Autti-Ramo I.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Eighty-two women who were consuming alcohol while pregnant attended a special clinic at the University Central Hospital, Helsinki with the aim of reducing heavy drinking during pregnancy. The children born to these women were followed up regularly. During their preschool years the children were assessed to have fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, pre- and/or postnatal growth retardation, or they were assessed to have normal cognitive and somatic growth. Of the original children, 70 of 82 could be traced st the age of la years. Through semistructured interview and contact with the health and social care authorities, information was gathered about schooling, family structure, whether help had been sought for behavioural difficulties and major adverse events in the family. The longer the intrauterine alcohol exposure and the more severe the diagnosis related to prenatal alcohol exposure, the more often the children required special education, were temporarily or permanently taken into care, and had behavioural problems. There is a considerable need for prolonged multidisciplinary follow-up and support of all children whose mothers have not been able to reduce drinking in early pregnancy, whether or not cognitive disturbances are evident in early childhood.

N2  - About 20% of pregnant women will drink alcohol, even though no universally safe level of prenatal alcohol consumption has been established. This study of 123 alcohol screen-positive pregnant women receiving a brief intervention in the 16th week of gestation examines the relationship of drinking goals, reasons for the goals, recognition of situations increasing risk of drinking, and subsequent antepartum consumption. While women who named abstinence as their antepartum drinking goal were more likely not to be consuming alcohol at the time of study enrollment (chi2 = 16.80, df = 1, p = .001), current drinkers who named abstinence as their goal did reduce subsequent prenatal alcohol use (chi2 = 10.04, df = 1, p = .002). All current drinkers who indicated fetal alcohol syndrome as a reason not to drink reduced their subsequent alcohol consumption (chi2 = 11.04, df = 1, p = .001). Future efforts may include the partners and support systems of pregnant women in education or intervention programs to reduce prenatal alcohol consumption to enhance their effectiveness.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To established the prevalence of fetal alcohol exposures; to compare physical, behavioural and learning patterns of children with significant alcohol exposure in utero with those of a group of children exposed to minimal alcohol; to assess the usefulness of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/fetal alcohol effect (FAE) score; and to provide feedback to parents, schools and communities. DESIGN: Parent questionnaire, complete physical examinations of children, psychometric tests of the children using elements of the Pediatric Early Elementary Examination (PEEX) and the Pediatric Examination of Educational Readiness (PEER), ADD-H comprehensive teachers rating scale (ACTeRS) score, the newly developed FAS/FAE Score, and the Brigance Comprehensive Inventory of Basic Skills to assess language and mathematical achievement. Testers were blinded to the results of the assessments and questionnaires. SETTING: Grades 1 to 3 at Sir Alexander MacKenzie School in Inuvik, Northwest Territories. RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of mothers reported frequent or binge drinking and 76% of mothers reported abstinence or moderate alcohol intake. There were significant ethnic differences; none of the Caucasian mothers reported frequently or binge drinking during pregnancy compared with 40% of Inuvialuit and 33% of Indian mothers. Children with exposure to frequent or binge drinking in utero had smaller palpebral fissures (2.3+/-0.1 cm versus 2.5+/-0.3 cm, P<0.01), smaller palpebral fissure to intercanthal distance ratio (0.77+/-0.05 versus 0.86+/-0.10, P<0.01) and smaller head circumferences (52.1+/-1.6 cm versus 53.62=1.6 cm, P<0.01) than those exposed to moderate drinking or abstinence. Children exposed to frequent or binge drinking in utero also demonstrated poorer coordination (P<0.005) and cortical function (P<0.01), attention problems, hyperactivity (ACTeRS), and poorer scholastic achievement in language (P<0.001) and mathematics (P<0.01) than their minimally exposed counterparts. In children in grades 2 and 3, a significant negative correlation was found between FAS/FAE scores and language (r=-0.55, P<0.001) and mathematical achievement (r=-0.28, P=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of drinking during pregnancy in the northern population studied was high, and exposure in utero was associated with physical abnormalities, difficulties with coordination and cortical function, and significant delays in language and mathematical achievement. The FAS/FAE score may be useful in predicting success or failure in language development.

N2  - Objective: To examine knowledge, attitudes, current clinical practices, and educational needs of obstetrician-gynecologists regarding patients' alcohol use during pregnancy. Methods: A 20-item, self-administered questionnaire on patients' prenatal alcohol use was sent to 1000 active ACOG fellows. Responses were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Results: Of the 60% of the obstetrician-gynecologists who responded to the survey, 97% reported asking their pregnant patients about alcohol use. When a patient reports alcohol use, most respondents reported that they always discuss adverse effects and always advise abstinence. One fifth of the respondents (20%) reported abstinence to be the safest way to avoid all four of the adverse pregnancy outcomes cited (ie, spontaneous abortion, central nervous system impairment, birth defects, and fetal alcohol syndrome); 13% were unsure about levels associated with all of the adverse outcomes; and 4% reported that consumption of eight or more drinks per week did not pose a risk for any of the four adverse outcomes. The two resources that respondents said they needed most to improve alcohol-use assessment were information on thresholds for adverse reproductive outcomes (83%) and referral resources for patients with alcohol problems (63%). Conclusion: Efforts should be made to provide practicing obstetrician-gynecologists with updates on the adverse effects of alcohol use by pregnant women and with effective methods for screening and counseling women who report alcohol use during pregnancy.

T1  - Avian genetic background modulates the neural crest apoptosis induced by ethanol exposure
A1  - Debelak K.A.
A1  - Smith S.M.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Background: Ethanol-induced neural crest apoptosis likely contributes to the distinctive craniofacial phenotype that results from prenatal alcohol exposure. The mechanism responsible for this apoptosis is incompletely understood. A serendipitous change in poultry production flocks led to the discovery that, in chick, the embryo's genetic background modulates its susceptibility to ethanol-induced apoptosis. Methods: We examined the level of ethanol-induced neural crest apoptosis in 11 chick layer strains or crosses, using acridine orange uptake. Results: Holding the ethanol dose and exposure stage constant, strains were classified into very sensitive (Babcock ISA, HyLine W98, Babcock B300/Hampshire Red cross [BxHR]), moderately sensitive (Spafas, HyLine W36, Babcock B300), and nonresponsive (DeKalb White and Black, Shaver White and 2000, DeKalb White/Hampshire Red cross). Detailed examination of two susceptible strains (W98, BxHR) and a resistant strain (DeKalb White) revealed that the DeKalb's nonresponse was not caused by a shift in timing of apoptosis, or to a lower alcohol exposure at either time of injection or time of death. Strains had identical stage distributions at the time of injection and at apoptosis; housing and diet were held constant. Conclusions: Factors within the embryo and/or egg environment can affect the susceptibility to ethanol-induced apoptosis. These sensitive and resistant strains will be important tools to dissect the molecular mechanism of ethanol-induced apoptosis, and for understanding how these losses affect subsequent development.

T1  - Parent ratings of behavior in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and IQ-matched controls
A1  - Mattson S.N.
A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Background: Behavioral disturbances are well documented in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. However, the degree to which these disturbances are related to factors other than alcohol, such as general intellectual functioning or socioeconomic status, is not known. Methods: Using the Child Behavior Checklist, parent-rated behaviors of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were compared with those of a control group matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and verbal IQ score. Using this same questionnaire, children with fetal alcohol syndrome were compared with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure that did not meet the criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome classification. Results: Data were analyzed by multivariate analyses of covariance. In the comparison of children with and without a history of prenatal alcohol exposure, significant differences were found on the competence, problem, and summary scales (all p < 0.05). For the secondary comparison between the fetal alcohol syndrome and the heavy prenatal alcohol exposure groups, there were no significant differences on any of the scales (all p > 0.10). Conclusions: These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure results in the significant and profound impairment of parent-rated behaviors and that these deficits are not explained entirely by the presence or absence of facial dysmorphology, general intellectual functioning, or demographic factors.

T1  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the hippocampus: Spatial behavior, electrophysiology, and neuroanatomy
A1  - Berman R.F.
A1  - Hannigan J.H.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), characterized by growth retardation, facial dysmorphologies, and a host of neurobehavioral impairments. Neurobehavioral effects in FAS, and in alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, include poor learning and memory, attentional deficits, and motor dysfunction. Many of these behavioral deficits can be modeled in rodents. This paper reviews the literature suggesting that many fetal alcohol effects result, at least in part, from teratogenic effects of alcohol on the hippocampus. Neurobehavioral studies show that animals exposed prenatally to alcohol are impaired in many of the same spatial learning and memory tasks sensitive to hippocampal damage, including T-mazes, the Morris water maze, and the radial arm maze. Direct evidence for hippocampal involvement is provided by neuroanatomical studies of the hippocampus documenting reduced numbers of neurons, lower dendritic spine density on pyramidal neurons, and decreased morphological plasticity after environmental enrichment in rats exposed prenatally to alcohol. Electrophysiological studies also demonstrate changes in synaptic activity in in vitro hippocampal brain slices isolated from prenatal alcohol-exposed animals. Considered together, these observations demonstrate that prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in abnormal hippocampal development and function. Such studies provide a better understanding of neurological deficits associated with FAS in humans, and may also contribute to the development of strategies to ameliorate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behavior.

T1  - Genetic and developmental modulation of cardiac deficits in prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Cavieres M.F.
A1  - Smith S.M.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Background: Increasing evidence demonstrates that genetic background is an important modulator of alcohol's effects on the developing fetus. Such effects are separable from maternal ethanol metabolism. Here, we study ethanol's effects on cardiogenesis in an avian model that shows strong cell death within neuronal and neural crest precursors following ethanol exposure. Methods: The study design tested the hypothesis that ethanol-induced losses of cardiac neural crest populations would disrupt outflow tract development and thus contribute to the valvuloseptal deficits observed in prenatal alcohol exposure. Three chick strains were exposed to alcohol at gestational windows between gastrulation and early heart septation (day 3 incubation), and then hearts were examined at the completion of morphogenesis (day 10 incubation). Results: Ethanol's impact on cardiac development was influenced by fetal genetics. The B300 x Hampshire Red cross exhibited pronounced cell death within cardiac neural crest populations but had normal development of the heart and aortic arches. Neural crest migration and differentiation into the distal outflow tract were also normal in these embryos, which suggested a capacity to repair earlier losses. The DeKalb White x Hampshire Red cross also did not exhibit cardiac defects. Hearts of the B300 strain had a unique phenotype with respect to ethanol exposure and exhibited a thin ventricular compact layer, dilatation, and reduced myosin/deoxyribonucleic acid and myosin/protein content, a phenotype that indicates disrupted myocardial maturation and inductive cues. The deficit was only observed when ethanol exposure occurred at stages 15 or 18 and apparently was independent of neural crest cell death. Such ventricular thinning might go undetected in the absence of extensive screening. Conclusions: Results add to the increasing evidence that genetic background strongly modulates the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. The results also suggest that embryos have a varying capacity to repair and recover from earlier neural crest losses.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Background: One of the most severe consequences of maternal alcohol consumption is the damage to the developing central nervous system. Material and methods: To evaluate the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on neuronal migration, neuronogenesis and myelination in the brain, pregnant BALB/C mice were maintained on either liquid diets containing ethanol (12 g/kg body weight) beginning on gestation day 6 or isocoloric diet (control group). The dams were sacrificed on gestation day 17 and the brain sections of the pups were analyzed using immunohistochemical method to evaluate the number of neurons, oligodendrioglial expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and neuronal expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Results: Ethanol-exposed pups revealed significantly weaker expression of MBP compared to the control group. In contrast, no significant difference of NCAM expression and neuronal cell count were present between ethanol-exposed pups and the control group. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that alcohol exposure affects the level of MBP expression, consequently causing a reduction in brain myelination that may lead to neuronal dysfunction. The ineffectiveness of prenatal alcohol exposure on the number of neurons in contrast to the previous reports might be due to the adequate sampling of areas for cell counting. Although there is a view that NCAM is involved both directly and indirectly in neuronal cell migration, we speculate that alcohol neuroembryotoxicity uncouples this relationship. Other adhesion molecules, such as L1, or extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin, would be other candidates for investigation.

N2  - This study examined the effects of maternal periconceptional alcohol intake on polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations in human neonates. The area percentage of each fatty acid in cord blood serum from 12 infants born to control women (who consumed <2 mL absolute ethanol/d) was compared with that of 9 infants born to women whose periconceptional alcohol intake averaged >30 mL absolute ethanol/d. Periconceptional alcohol use was associated with a 30% increase in the proportion of docosahexaenoic acid (22.6n-3) in cord blood (3.0% of total lipid in control infants compared with 3.9% in alcohol-exposed infants; P < 0.01). The rise in the proportion of 22:6n-3 was responsible for increases in the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids and the ratio of long-chain n-3 to n-6 fatty acids (P < 0.055). Examination of the lipid-class fatty acid profile indicated that serum lipid alterations were localized to the cholesterol esters; 22:6n-3 in the cholesterol esters of alcohol-exposed infants increased 54% (P < 0.011) and arachidonic acid increased 55% (p < 0.005). The relative fatty acyl composition of maternal serum showed a significant increase in 18:0 fatty acids in the alcohol- exposed group (25%, P < 0.005) but there were no changes in the other fatty acids. The increase in the proportion of 22:6n-3 was unexpected but is consistent with the hypothesis that this essential lipid may be conserved selectively. These results imply that the lifelong neurobehavioral and sensory dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders may be due in part to PUFA dysregulation.

T1  - Effect of enriched environment rearing on impairments in cortical excitability and plasticity after prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Rema V.
A1  - Ebner F.F.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - The daily ingestion of alcohol by pregnant mammals exposes the fetal brain to varying levels of alcohol through the placental circulation. Here we focus on the lingering impact on cortical function of 6.5% alcohol administered in a liquid diet to pregnant rats throughout gestation, followed by 3 alcohol-free months before brain function was analyzed in the offspring. Both spontaneous activity of the neurons in the barrel cortex and the level of response to test stimuli applied to the whiskers remained reduced by >75% after alcohol exposure. Whisker pairing, a type of cortical plasticity induced by trimming all but two whiskers in adult rats, occurred in <1 d in controls, but required 14 d to reach significance after alcohol exposure. These long-term neuronal deficits are present in all layers of cortex and affect neurons with both fast and slow action potentials. Plasticity is first seen in the total sample of neurons at 14 d; however, by 7 d, neurons in layer II/III already show plasticity, with no change in layer IV neurons, and a reverse shift occurs toward the inactive whisker in layer V neurons. Analysis of NMDA receptor subunits shows a persistent, ~30-50% reduction of NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits at postnatal day 90 in the barrel field cortex. Exposing the prenatal alcohol-exposed rats to enriched rearing conditions significantly improves all measured cortical functions but does not restore normal values. The results predict that combinations of interventions will be necessary to completely restore cortical function after exposure of the fetal brain to alcohol.

T3  - Alkohol in der schwangerschaft - Konflikte bei frauen und praventive probleme
A1  - Loser H.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - All programs in prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) have been without success until now. Since the first descriptions of FAS in the early seventies the question arose, how the drinking pattern of pregnant women have changed and which maternal conflicts mainly inhibited prevention. Between 1973 and 1999 312 children with fullblown FAS and 119 with fetal alcohol effects were diagnosed, and their alcohol related historical data were assessed at the University Childrens Hospital in Munster. Only 93 mothers, all being alcohol dependent or abuser, could be asked postnatally in a trustful, structured interview as to their alcohol conflicts in pregnancy. The feelings of guilt and scruple, and the consciousness of being indebted to the damaged child are predominent. Many women did not know the real embryotoxic risk when drinking thoughtlessly and negligently in the first weeks of pregnancy. The own physical well-being could not be considered as separated from that of the child, mainly with alcohol dependent women. Social compulsion, trouble in partnership and the risk to lose the right of care for the child are further problems. Alcohol in pregnancy remains a problem which privately and in public is pushed away, concealed and displaced as harmless. Most of the preventive efforts in public failed to find an approach to alcohol drinking women and mainly to dependent drinker. Since alcohol is the most important damaging substance for the fetus with longlasting consequences, maternal conflicts and unchanged social attitude have to be considered as an essential cause of failed prevention.

T1  - Was the fetal alcohol syndrome recognized by the Greeks and Romans?
A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers/scientists are frequently quoted as expressing an awareness of potential harm associated with drinking during pregnancy. However, the statements attributed to these authors were not made by them. Instead, they are interpretations, presented in the form of verbatim statements, of their views relating to procreation. Although they did have something to say about the role of alcohol in procreation, it was the effects of drinking on the male body at the time of conception, and especially alcohol's effects on male body temperature, that concerned them. A cold body at the time of conception was believed to enhance the likelihood of conceiving a female, which to the Greeks and Romans was a 'deformity'.

T1  - Optic nerve morphology may reveal adverse events during prenatal and perinatal life-digital image analysis
A1  - Hellstrom A.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Objective: To evaluate optic nerve morphology in children with various conditions caused by adverse events during prenatal and/or perinatal life and to investigate whether optic nerve morphology can reveal brain lesions associated with these conditions, as well as provide insight into the etiology and timing of the prenatal and perinatal damage. Methods and patients: A digital image analysis technique was used to analyze fundus photographs. One hundred healthy Swedish individuals of various ages from childhood to adolescence constituted a reference group. The following patient groups were chosen to represent various clinical conditions affecting the newborn or fetus at different stages of development: children born preterm (N = 39), children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS [N = 16]), children with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL [N = 17]), and children with septo-optic dysplasia (SOD [N = 6]). Results: Preterm children without known brain lesions demonstrated normal optic disk morphology but abnormal retinal vascular pattern; children born preterm with an acquired brain lesion late in gestation (PVL) demonstrated normal disk size with enlarged cups in addition to the abnormal vascular pattern. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (FAS) had a subnormal optic disk area with increased tortuosity of both arteries and veins, whereas children born at term with an early acquired brain lesion (SOD) had a markedly reduced optic disk area with isolated tortuosity of the retinal veins. Conclusions: Evaluation of optic nerve morphology, by digital image analysis, demonstrated that differences in ocular fundus morphology were correlated with differences in etiology and timing of the adverse event occurring in prenatal and perinatal life. In addition, digital image analysis may be a helpful tool for understanding variations in optic nerve and retinal vessel morphology and their relationship with central nervous pathology.

N2  - Background: Children with heavy, prenatal alcohol exposure have well documented deficits in overall cognitive ability. Recently, attention has turned to the executive function (EF) domain in this population. Until recently, comprehensive measures of EF have not been available within one test battery. This study used a battery of tests to assess four domains of EF in alcohol-exposed children. Methods: The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Scale was used to evaluate EF in 18 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with and without a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and 10 nonexposed controls. Children ranged in age from 8 to 15 years. Measures from four domains of executive functioning were analyzed: planning ability, cognitive flexibility, selective inhibition, and concept formation and reasoning. Tasks consisted of primary EF measures as well as measures of secondary component skills. Results: Alcohol-exposed children were deficient on EF measures compared with nonexposed controls. Furthermore, in most cases, children with and without the FAS diagnosis did not differ from one another. These deficits were not entirely explainable by concomitant deficits on component skills. Specific impairments were identified within the domains of planning and response inhibition, with additional deficits in abstract thinking and flexibility. Conclusions: Deficits in executive functioning were observed in alcohol-exposed children with or without the diagnosis of FAS and in the absence of mental retardation. Performance on these EF tasks provides insight into the cognitive processes driving overall performance and has implications for adaptive and daily functions. These results are consistent with anecdotal and empirical reports of deficits in behavioral control and with neuroanatomical evidence of volumetric reductions in structures within the frontal-subcortical system in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Chan D.Q.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) describes the systemic and ocular anomalies resulting from the teratogenic effect of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. It is a leading cause of preventable birth defects in the U.S. Case Reports: Two case reports illustrate the characteristic findings in FAS. These include growth retardation, cognitive impairment, and facial dysmorphism. Ocular signs are prevalent, including small palpebral fissure, microcornea, strabismus, myopia, astigmatism, and optic nerve hypoplasia. Discussion: Fetal alcohol exposure can lead to a wide spectrum of systemic defects and vision deficits. The increasing frequency of drinking among pregnant women in recent years should call more public attention to this detrimental yet preventable syndrome. Conclusion: The high frequency of ocular manifestations aids in making a diagnosis of FAS, which can be challenging. Eye-care professionals can play an important role in patient management and the educational process.

T1  - In utero alcohol and postnatal methylphenidate: Locomotion and dopamine receptors
A1  - Randall S.
A1  - Hannigan J.H.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause central nervous system abnormalities and dysfunction referred to as Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND). Repeated intermittent methylphenidate (Ritalin()) was used as a psychopharmacological challenge to reveal functional alterations in dopamine binding sites in rats exposed prenatally to alcohol. Pregnant Long-Evans dams were intubated with 0, 3, or 5 g/kg/day of alcohol from gestational day (GD) 8 to GD20. Adult offspring received repeated intraperitoneal injections of 0, 4, or 8 mg/kg of methylphenidate (MET), and were tested periodically for locomotor activity. Autoradiographic assessment of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors binding were visualized using [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]raclopride, respectively. Prenatal alcohol did not produced significant dose-dependent effects on adult locomotor activity. Repeated MET injections produced dose-dependent sensitization of locomotor activity in all groups. The 3-g/kg prenatal alcohol group had a significantly decreased number of dopamine D2 binding sites within the dorsal and ventral striatum. This effect was reversed by MET. The neural changes detected in the lower alcohol group may indicate persistent changes within the dopaminergic system due to prenatal alcohol exposure. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development were evaluated at 13 and 26 months and on three language measures at 26 months, in 92 economically disadvantaged, African American toddlers. After consideration of 17 potential confounders, a significant alcohol-related deficit in the Mental Development Index (MDI) was seen at 13 months as was a tendency for poorer Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) performance. The PDI deficit continued to be evident at 26 months. When the 26-month MDI was factor analyzed, four factors emerged: Linguistic Representation, Spatial Fine Motor, Other Fine Motor, and Relational Representation. As in a previous study of these children at 13 months of age, Spatial Fine Motor deficits were specifically associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. These findings appear consistent with reports relating prenatal alcohol exposure to poorer spatial visualization and spatial memory in adolescence. No effects of prenatal exposure were detected on language. Maternal postpartum drinking was associated with decreased language intelligibility. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Background: Deficits in attention are commonly identified among patients who have been prenatally exposed to alcohol, and they often affect the ability of the patients to function appropriately in society. Methods: Eleven adult patients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) were compared with nine adult subjects with no history of prenatal alcohol exposure, using four tests of visually and auditorially mediated attention. Results: In relation to the comparison group, patients with FAS/FAE exhibited substantial deficits in both auditory and visual attention; the auditory deficits were greater. We observed two predominant patterns of deficits among patients with FAS/FAE, one involving both auditory and visual attention problems and the other involving less severe auditory problems and even fewer visual problems. Most subjects with FAS or FAE had some manifestations of attention problems in at least one of the tests of attention used in this study. We present a new graphical representation of individual auditory Continuous Performance Test data across a 6-min period, which, compared with conventional scores, more clearly reveals the markedly disrupted and variable attention patterns displayed by some individuals with FAS or FAE. Conclusions: These findings suggest that detailed analysis of the pattern of individual performance for each subject is an important aspect of Continuous Performance Test assessment. Our findings further suggest that intellectual performance (intelligence quotient score) alone is not sufficient to account for the patterns of disrupted attention for individuals with FAS/FAE. Assessment of individuals with FAS or FAE should include measurement of attentional functioning in both the visual and auditory modalities.

T1  - Implicit and explicit memory functioning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with widespread and devastating neurodevelopmental deficits. Numerous reports have suggested memory deficits in both humans and animals exposed prenatally to alcohol. However, the nature of these memory deficits remains to be characterized. Recently children with fetal alcohol syndrome were shown to have learning and memory deficits on a verbal learning and memory measure that involved free recall and recognition memory. The current study seeks to further characterize memory functioning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure by evaluating priming performance. The choice of task is also relevant given previous studies of memory performance in patient groups with and without involvement of the basal ganglia, a group of structures known to be affected in fetal alcohol syndrome. Three groups were evaluated for lexical priming, free recall, recognition memory, and verbal fluency: (1) children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure; (2) children with Down syndrome; and (3) nonexposed controls. The children with Down syndrome showed significantly less priming than alcohol-exposed children, who did not differ from controls. In addition, the alcohol-exposed children were impaired on the free recall task but not on the recognition memory task, whereas the children with Down syndrome performed significantly worse than the alcohol-exposed group on both tasks. Finally, on the verbal fluency task, children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were impaired on both category and letter fluency, but the degree of impairment was greater for letter fluency. These results further characterize the memory deficits in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure suggesting that in spite of learning and memory deficits, they are able to benefit from priming of verbal information.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Certain skin disorders are affected by alcohol abuse. Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy also gives rise to a typical malformation pattern in the child with a varying degree of severity (grade I-III). The diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is based on the detailed history of the maternal alcohol consumption in combination with the clinical, morphological, intellectual and psychosocial development of the child. The behavior of the child is also of diagnostic value. The grade of severity of the FAS can be determined during the first three years of life on the basis of a scoring system. In addition to medical care and surgical treatment of associated disorders, early support for the mental development of the child is of immense importance. Furthermore, the medical, social and psychological care of the mother must be considered. In the field of dermatology, knowledge about the pathomechanism of FAS is also important for its prevention in unborn children. Women of childbearing age presenting with dermatological signs of possible alcohol abuse, should alert the dermatologist to the possible risk to the child of FAS. Familiarity with FAS and the ability to recognise its clinical features are important for the adequate treatment and support of the affected child and for the mother suffering from alcohol disease, in cooperation with other treating doctors.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Background: Frequent alcohol use during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy can result in spontaneous abortion and dysmorphologic changes in the developing organ systems of the embryo, including the heart, kidneys, and brain. However, few population-based studies are available that describe the prevalence of frequent drinking (6 or more drinks per week) among women prior to and during early pregnancy (the periconceptional period), and the sociodemographic and behavioral factors that characterize these women. Such knowledge is fundamental to the design of targeted interventions for the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other prenatal alcohol-related disorders.Methods: This cross-sectional study used survey data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics as part of the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS). Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated using SUDAAN, and multivariate analyses were used to determine risk factors for frequent drinking.Results: Forty-five percent of all women surveyed reported consuming alcohol during the 3 months before finding out they were pregnant, and 5% reported consuming 6 or more drinks per week. Sixty percent of women who reported alcohol consumption also reported that they did not learn they were pregnant until after the fourth week of gestation. Risk factors for frequent drinking during the periconceptional period included 1 or more of the following: being unmarried, being a smoker, being white non-Hispanic, being 25 years of age or older, or being college educated.Conclusions: Half of all pregnant women in this study drank alcohol during the 3 months preceding pregnancy recognition , with 1 in 20 drinking at moderate to heavy levels. The majority did not know they were pregnant until after the fourth week of pregnancy, and many did not know until after the 6th week. Alcohol is a teratogen capable of producing a number of adverse reproductive and infant outcomes. Public health measures needed to reduce these potentially harmful exposures include alcohol assessment , education, and counseling for women of childbearing age, with referral sources for problem drinking, and family planning services for pregnancy postponement until problem drinking is resolved.

N2  - Background: This longitudinal study examines the effects of alcohol use during pregnancy on the growth and gestational age at birth of 413 offspring of adolescents. Methods: Data were collected during 1990 to 1994. The adolescents were from a prenatal clinic in Pittsburgh, PA. They were interviewed at mid-pregnancy and at delivery to obtain information on alcohol and other substance use before and during pregnancy. Infants were examined 24 to 36 hr after birth. Results: The average maternal age was 16.3 (12-18) years; 68% were African American. Prenatal exposure to alcohol during the second trimester was significantly related to decreases in head circumference, birthweight, and chest circumference. There was also a significant relationship between alcohol exposure in each trimester and lower Apgar scores. All of the analyses controlled for other prenatal substance use and covariates of drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with decreases in fetal growth and in APGAR scores in the offspring of adolescents.

N2  - It has been reported that maternal ethanol consumption leads to deficits in the limbic areas involved in cognitive functions and interferes with synthesis and utilization of neurotrophins. In the present study, it was hypothesized that prenatal alcohol intake might induce neuroanatomical alterations in the entorhinal cortex (EC). We also investigated the possible EC involvement of brain nerve growth factor (NGF), the first neurotrophin to be isolated, during such pathological events. To test this hypothesis, we used pregnant mice exposed to ethanol during EC neurogenesis (starting about gestational day 8). Our data show that prenatal alcohol intake in male mice alters the EC neuronal growth and differentiation. These morphological alterations are accompanied by an altered NGF level in the EC of prenatal alcohol-treated mice. We also found a decrease in choline acetyltransferase- and neuropeptide Y-immunopositive neurons in the EC of alcohol-exposed mice. However, the relationship between neuronal damage induced in the EC by ethanol, low presence of NGF, and the possible functional and behavioral consequences remains to be elucidated.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Children of women who abuse alcohol during pregnancy may be affected by varying degrees of neurological abnormality, even if they are not diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The extent of the behavioral deficits of the affected offspring may be a function of several factors, such as the differential vulnerability of the various regions of the brain-to-alcohol insult. In this study, groups of timed-pregnant rats were exposed to different doses of alcohol (EtOH 2.25, EtOH 4.5, EtOH 6.5 g/kg/day) or control conditions (maltose dextrin solution or no treatment) from embryonic day 1 (E1: sperm positive) to E20. On E33 (usually postnatal day 10), all pups were perfused. Their brains were removed, dissected into forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem, and weighed. Blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were measured on 4 different days of gestation, but the peak BACs across gestation for the three alcohol-treated groups averaged 142, 294, and 413 mg/dl for the EtOH 2.25, EtOH 4.5, and EtOH 6.5 g/kg groups, respectively. Analysis of the body weight data indicated that pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group had a greater somatic growth deficit than pups from all other groups. Although the whole brain, forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem weights of pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group were significantly smaller than those in the control groups, within-treatment group analyses indicated that the cerebella of pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group were more severely affected than were their forebrains or brainstems. The analyses of the brain region to body weight ratios revealed again that the cerebellum-to-body-weight ratio of pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group was more severely affected than the forebrain or brainstem to body weight ratios. Collectively, these data lend support to the view that gross regions of the brain are differentially vulnerable to alcohol insult during the first two trimesters equivalent, and suggest that the cerebellum is vulnerable to injury from exposure to high BACs during a developmental period other than the third trimester equivalent.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Background: It is widely known that prenatal alcohol exposure is related to cognitive and behavioral deficits throughout childhood and adolescence. Much research has focused on understanding and quantifying the cognitive profile of children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) with relatively less empirical research on behavioral or psychosocial adjustment. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral and psychosocial profile of children exposed to heavy amounts of alcohol prenatally. Method: Two groups of subjects were evaluated: an alcohol-exposed group (ALC) and a nonexposed control group (NC) each made up of 32 subjects matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. The alcohol-exposed group consisted of children heavily exposed to alcohol in utero, including 19 children diagnosed with FAS. The Personality Inventory for Children (PIC) was completed by the caretaker of each child. Four validity/screening scales and 12 clinical scales were scored for all subjects. Results: Analyses revealed significant group differences on four validity/screening scales and 12 substantive scales. Within the ALC group, the profile of children without FAS was similar to that of children with FAS, with the exception that their profiles were consistent with less cognitive impairment. Conclusions: These findings indicate that in addition to previously reported cognitive impairments, heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is related to significant impairments in psychosocial functioning. Even children without alcohol-related physical anomalies suffer from impaired psychosocial functioning. Because impairments of this nature can interfere with functioning across multiple domains, effective early intervention programs should be considered for families of alcohol-exposed children. Furthermore, given the similarities of alcohol- exposed children with and without FAS, it is imperative to obtain prenatal alcohol exposure histories on all children experiencing cognitive or psychosocial deficits.

N2  - Background and Objective: Liver transplantation for terminal liver failure enables patients to look forward to many years of good quality life. As a result, more and more of the often still relatively young transplant recipients enquire about the possible risks to a child procreated after transplantation. Patients and methods: During 9.5 years (between September 1988 and April 1998) 1000 liver transplantations were performed on 911 patients (374 females, 537 males) at our hospital. The potential for parenthood existed for 163 women (aged between 16 an 46 years) and 520 men. 14 children were born of 14 women, six pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion or miscarriage and three other women are now pregnant. Seven men reported paternity of eight children after transplantation. All data were collected prospectively. Results: Six of the 14 births (42.9%) proceeded normally, but up to three complications developed in the other eight (57.1%). Six women (35.7%) developed hypertension during the pregnancy. There was no case of transplant dysfunction or toxaemia of pregnancy. Half the births were by caesarian section. Premature births occurred in two women (14.3%); four children were underweight (< 2500 g) at birth (28.6%). The seven men, at a mean age of 44 (7-75) months after transplantation, fathered eight children, at present aged between 11 months and 6 years, all of whom have developed normally. The 13 children of the post-transplantation mothers are also without malformation or abnormal development. One child's development is retarded due to a fetal alcohol syndrome resulting from the mother's post- transplantation alcohol abuse during pregnancy. All the parents are well at present and live with their children. Conclusions: Both men and women can procreate at a relatively low risk to the offspring. But for this to happen, an informed decision for parenthood must be made by the prospective parent together with her/his partner and the doctor in charge, she/he must be in good physical condition with stable transplant function, and there must be frequent interdisciplinary monitoring during any post-transplantation pregnancy.

N2  - The Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project is a longitudinal study of the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol and other substances. Women were selected from a prenatal clinic and interviewed at the 4th and 7th months of pregnancy. Their offspring were examined at delivery, at 8 and 18 months, and at 3, 6, and 10 years. This report examined 610 offspring, at age 10, who were exposed prenatally to alcohol. Most alcohol use in this low-income cohort was light to moderate, although the entire spectrum of alcohol use is represented. The weight, length, head circumference, and skinfold thickness of the offspring were measured. At each assessment phase, we found a significant association between size and prenatal exposure to alcohol. At age 10, the children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol continued to be significantly smaller in weight, height, head circumference, and skin fold thickness. These results indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure has a long-term impact on offspring growth.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is currently the major cause of mental retardation in the Western world. Since FAS is not a natural phenomenon and is created by mixing alcohol and pregnancy, the solution to decreasing the incidence of all alcohol-related birth defects is therefore entirely preventable. To date, little is known about the effectiveness of prevention programs in reducing the incidence of FAS. Therefore, it is the intention of this article to review the effectiveness of prevention programs in lowering the incidence of FAS. The present review revealed that prevention programs, to date, have been successful in raising awareness of FAS levels across the groups examined. However, this awareness has not been translated into behavioral changes in 'high risk' drinkers as consumption levels in this group have decreased only marginally, indicating prevention programs have had minimal or no impact in lowering the incidence of FAS. Urgent steps must now be taken to fully test prevention programs, and find new strategies involving both sexes, to reduce and ultimately eliminate the incidence of FAS.

N2  - Objectives: To determine secular trends in pregnancy-related reduction in frequent alcohol use (i.e.>5 drinks/occasion or > 7 drinks/week) among US women, 1988-95. Methods: Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we obtained the prevalence rate ratio (PRR) for alcohol use by pregnant women compared with that by non-pregnant women, with an emphasis on frequent use, and the median number of drinks consumed per week. Results: The overall PRR for any alcohol use did not vary significantly (p > 0.05) over the study period, decreasing from 0.34 (95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.29-0.40) during 1988-89, to 0.24 (95% Cl 0.21-0.28) in 1990-93, and then increasing to 0.30 (95% Cl 0.25-0.37) in 1995. The pregnancy-related reduction for any alcohol use was smallest among women who were aged 31-44 years, non-white or unmarried. The PRR for frequent drinking varied significantly over time, decreasing from 0.20 (95% Cl 0.12-0.33) during 1988- 89 to 0.08 (95% Cl 0.05-0.12) in 1990-91 and then increasing to 0.26 (95% Cl 0.16-0.40) in 1995 (p < 0.05). For frequent drinking, the pregnancy-related reduction was smallest among non-white women and among unmarried women. The median number of drinks consumed per week remained steady over time for both pregnant (any, 1.0; frequent, 5.0) and non-pregnant women (any 1.5; frequent, 6.0). Conclusion: Among reproductive-age women who are frequent alcohol users, the likelihood of continuing frequent alcohol use into pregnancy has increased in recent years, but the amount consumed has remained stable. Public health efforts aimed at increasing the availability of interventions for alcohol-using women of reproductive age are needed to prevent alcohol- exposed pregnancies.

N2  - Background and objective: Maternal alcohol addiction in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE) in children. At present, little is known about the physical, mental, and social long-term consequences in adulthood. Patients and methods: Since 1974, 52 children with FAS and FAE, all born to alcohol dependent mothers, were prospectively followed up from birth to adulthood. Height, weight and head circumferences were based on percentile standards; mental and school development were assessed by school reports and by intelligence subtests. By structural interviews, occupational and social follow-up were assessed. Results: Growth retardation continued mainly in severely affected adults with underweight in 26%, underweight in 30%, and microcephaly in 46%. They mostly lived in foster families, only 6/52 were able to live independently. In 56% special schools for handicapped and mentally disabled were attended. In most cases (37/52), simple occupations without vocational training were practised. Conclusions: It is mainly the neurotoxic effects of alcohol in pregnancy that have longlasting developmental significance in adults. Because of the dysmorphic changes over time, it is difficult to diagnose FAS and FAE only in adulthood.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can result in central nervous system deficits in infants ranging from fetal alcohol effects to fetal alcohol syndrome. Changes in cerebral metabolism causing ischemic in utero conditions can also result from ethanol (EtOH). Growth factors have been shown to ameliorate ischemic damage and EtOH-induced neurotoxicity. However, using an in vitro model system of fetal alcohol effects/fetal alcohol syndrome, this study examines the neuroprotective effects of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor against EtOH treatment (0, 200, 400, 800, or 1600 mg/dl) combined with acute ischemia (2-hour hypoxia in EtOH-containing glucose-free media) followed by chronic hypoglycemia (16-hour glucose deprivation in EtOH-containing media). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assays assessed relative neurotoxicity. Glial cell derived neurotrophic factor was not neuroprotective. Nerve growth factor protected against ischemia/hypoglycemia combined with 0-1600 mg/dl EtOH. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor protected against ischemia/hypoglycemia combined with 0-800 mg/dl EtOH. These studies demonstrate marked growth factor neuroprotection against a myriad of conditions encountered by developing EtOH-exposed fetuses.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure has been shown to produce hyperresponsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to immune challenges. Because cytokines, which are released in response to immune challenges, are known to activate the HPA axis, this study determined whether altered release of cytokines contribute to the HPA hyperresponsiveness to immune challenges observed after prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant dams were exposed to alcohol vapors (6-7 hr daily) between days 7 and 18 of gestation. At postnatal days 45 and 60, control (C) and prenatal alcohol-exposed (E) offspring were subjected to three different types of immune challenges: injections of interleukin-1beta or endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), or turpentine-induced tissue injury. We observed the expected higher plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone levels in E compared with C rats, and this HPA hyperresponsiveness was greater in E females compared with E males. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-6 responses were comparable in the C and E groups. Females exhibited significantly higher corticosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 responses than males. These results indicate that (1) prenatal alcohol exposure produces HPA hyperresponsiveness to immune challenges; (2) prenatal alcohol treatment does not influence the release of cytokines to immune challenges; and (3) there are gender differences in the secretory pattern of corticosterone and cytokines to immune challenges. Therefore, these data do not support the hypothesis that cytokines play a role in the hyperresponsiveness of the HPA axis to immune challenges observed after prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Identification of children with fetal alcohol syndrome and opportunity for referral of their mothers for primary prevention--Washington, 1993-1997
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Heavy maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy can cause permanent birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Although these alcohol-related defects are entirely preventable, the factors associated with maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy are complex and often resistant to change. In addition, not all women who drink heavily will produce children with FAS. Although targeting primary prevention efforts to all women at risk for drinking during pregnancy is ideal, limited resources require targeting women at the highest risk for producing children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. One such population is women who have already given birth to an alcohol-affected child. This high-risk population is not easily identified because not all children with FAS have their condition diagnosed, and these birth mothers are often separated from their children during the first few years of the child's life, often before a diagnosis of FAS has been considered. However, once identified, these women are receptive to intervention. To identify a population of women at highest risk for a future alcohol-exposed pregnancy through diagnosing a previously affected birth child, researchers at the University of Washington developed the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN). This report summarizes the results of this program and documents the feasibility of identifying persons who may have FAS so their condition can be diagnosed and their birth mothers can be identified and referred to prevention services.

A1  - Welty T.K.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Although Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) rates have been reported to be higher in American Indian populations, no screening tool has been validated for alcohol use in American Indian women. The objectives of this study were to compare the detection of prenatal alcohol use by a self-administered questionnaire to detection by clinical interview; and to ascertain whether the screening tool would increase detection of pregnant women who are abusing alcohol. The hospital records of the women were reviewed for any history of alcohol-related illnesses or injuries to compare with results obtained from the questionnaire. Seventy women attending their first prenatal clinic visit on a reservation were screened for alcohol use. There was a wide range in detection of prenatal alcohol use (20%-71% of the sample detected) depending on the method used. There was a large variation in sensitivities (7%-93%) of the individual questions in identifying patients detected as "high risk" by the clinicians. The T-ACE screening questions significantly increased detection of alcohol use compared to detection by the clinicians (p = 0.04 Fisher's exact test). Due to the large variation between different methods of detection, it is recommended that screening tools that increase detection of alcohol use should be combined with methods of higher specificity such as using questions about quantity and frequency of alcohol intake, medical chart review and clinical interview. We also found that various interpretations of the screening questions by the patients highlighted the need to tailor the wording of individual questions to the particular patient population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE) encompass a pattern of birth defects in persons whose mothers ingested alcohol during pregnancy. People with FAE display fewer of the FAS traits. AIM: To assess the prevalence and features of these affections in a secondary nutritional recovery centre. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All charts of children admitted between 1985 and 1995 were reviewed, and those children diagnosed as having a FAS or FAE by a geneticist were considered for this study. Birth, maternal, social and economic characteristics, psychomotor abilities (using Denver test) and response to nutritional treatment were assessed. RESULTS: During the study period, 1572 infants were admitted to the centre, and 1.97% (70% female) were diagnosed as having a FAS or FAE. These infants were admitted at 11.1 +/- 4.5 months of age and discharged after 96.7 +/- 58.1 months of hospitalisation. Mean mother's age was 33 +/- 7 years, and all belonged to low socioeconomic levels. Mean birth weight was 2048 +/- 431 g and 2469 +/- 619 g in children with FAS and FAE respectively (p < 0.03). Children with FAE performed better for gross and fine motor abilities than those with FAS. No differences were observed for language performance. Sixty five percent of children with FAS and 71% of children with FAE had an adequate weight and height increment during nutritional therapy. A multiple regression analysis showed that age at admission and gestational age were significant predictors of weight gain during therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol has teratogenic effects on the foetus that affect craneal size and psychomotor development. Alcohol also affects pre and post natal growth.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: a review for Texas physicians

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is commonly believed to be the leading known cause of mental retardation in the United States, although surveillance at state and national levels is problematic. The most serious consequence of fetal alcohol exposure is central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. While the facial features of FAS become more subtle with age, growth deficits and, particularly, the CNS impairment appear to be permanent. Among factors that affect the risk and severity of fetal alcohol damage are the timing of the alcohol exposure, binge drinking that produces high blood alcohol concentrations, polydrug use, and genetic variations. From various studies, the incidence of FAS ranges from 0.2 to 3.0 affected birth per 1000 live births. The methods of measuring FAS occurrence are fraught with difficulties and inaccuracies, as are surveys of alcohol use by women during pregnancy. Still, indirect studies both in Texas and the United States suggest that the occurrence of FAS is increasing. A first, important step to reducing the incidence of FAS and related problems is to increase the awareness of physicians and other health care providers about the issues of FAS diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Referral and information resources about FAS are provided.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - During pregnancy, the hormonal systems of the mother and fetus are intricately interconnected to ensure normal fetal development. Accordingly, maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can interfere with fetal development, not only directly, through adverse effects exerted by alcohol that crosses the placenta and enters the fetal bloodstream, but also indirectly, by disturbing the functions and interactions of maternal and fetal hormones. In both the mother and the fetus, alcohol exposure can impair the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which regulates the body's response to stress; the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which controls reproductive functions; and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, which regulates the metabolism of almost all tissues. In addition, alcohol can interfere with the activities of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors, which promote body growth and activity. Some of the effects of maternal alcohol consumption on fetal hormone systems may contribute to the adverse effects observed in children with fetal alcohol syndrome and related disorders.

N2  - Understanding the nature of cognitive deficits among adolescent patients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) can direct future research on assessment and intervention. In an exploratory study, nine nonretarded teenagers with FAS were administered tests of IQ and adaptive behavior, and neuropsychological tests presumed sensitive to alcohol effects. Their performance was compared with psychometric norms and to data from a sample of 174 adolescents with minimal or no prenatal alcohol exposure. These nonretarded FAS patients commonly showed behavior problems, decreased social competence, and poor school performance. Neuropsychological testing revealed significant deficits, although no one neuropsychological profile characterized all patients and not all tests revealed problems. Relatively intact performance was observed in procedural memory, some measures of reaction time, and some reading measures. Deficits were seen on attentional and memory tasks tapping visual-spatial skills, short-term auditory attention and memory, declarative learning, and cognitive flexibility and planning. Difficulties in processing speed and accuracy were also seen. Comparison with a subgroup of 52 nonalcohol-exposed or minimally alcohol-exposed adolescents with a similar range of IQ scores demonstrated that deficits among these FAS patients were not fully explained by a general lowering of IQ.

T1  - What do physicians know and say about fetal alcohol syndrome: A survey of obstetricians, pediatricians, and family medicine physicians
A1  - Abel E.L.
A1  - Kruger M.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Pediatricians, obstetricians, and family practice physicians in Michigan were surveyed by mail for their knowledge and opinions about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE). Physicians said that about 67% of their patients raised questions about drinking during pregnancy but only 2% specifically referred to FAS or FAE. Most physicians were uncertain about whether their colleagues were sufficiently aware of FAS, whether FAS could be diagnosed at birth, or if physicians were acquainted with the syndrome's major criteria. However, most believed FAS was not being overdiagnosed and believed that making a diagnosis of FAS at birth could lead to improved treatment of an affected child. Physicians also believed that physician counseling was a more effective way of reducing the incidence of FAS/FAE than warning labels. Forty-one percent of the physicians placed the threshold for FAS at one to three drinks per day and 38% placed the threshold at one or fewer drinks a day. Thirty-five percent placed the estimated incidence of FAS at 1 to 2 per 1000 in the United States. We conclude that physicians are in relative agreement about the effects of drinking during pregnancy and the value of physician counseling but are misguided as to what constitutes a true risk level of drinking as far as the etiology of FAS is concerned.

T1  - Diagnosing moral disorder: The discovery and evolution of fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Armstrong E.M.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was invented in 1973. This paper investigates the process by which a cluster of birth defects associated with exposure to alcohol in utero came to be a distinct medical diagnosis, focusing on the first ten years of the medical literature on FAS. Fetal alcohol syndrome was 'discovered' by a group of American dysmorphologists who published the first case reports and coined the term FAS. However, the nature of the diagnosis and its Salient symptoms were determined collectively over time by the medical profession as a whole. The paper traces the natural history of the diagnosis in the U.S. through five stages: introduction, confirmation and corroboration, dissent, expansion, and diffusion. FAS serves as an example of the social construction of clinical diagnosis; moral entrepreneurship plays a key role and the medical literature on FAS is infused with moral rhetoric, including passages from classical mythology, philosophy, and the Bible. FAS is a moral as well as a medical diagnosis, reflecting the broader cultural concerns of the era in which it was discovered, including a greater awareness of environmental threats to health, the development of fetal medicine, an emphasis on 'the perfect child,' and a growing paradigm of maternal-fetal conflict.

N2  - A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was performed with forty-six 5- to 9-year-old children exposed to alcohol in utero for varying durations. The children were subdivided according to duration of maternal alcohol abuse, as follows: during trimester I (n = 16), during trimesters I and II (n = 16), and throughout pregnancy (n = 14). A control group (n = 26) consisted of unexposed children. Fetal alcohol exposure throughout pregnancy had significant, diffuse effects on the development of the children, whereas exposure only during early pregnancy did not. Observed cognitive deficits included problems in naming, receptive language, attention, and visual-motor functions. Verbal and visual memory and manual motor precision did not significantly differ between the groups.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Alcohol is the most common identifiable teratogenic cause of mental retardation in North America. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a major public health problem, which is frequently under diagnosed by physicians. Objective: To identify and quantify the maternal risk factors and neonatal characteristics of children with FAS. Design: a retrospective case-control study using birth certificate data of North Dakota children diagnosed with FAS. Five controls were selected for each patient. Controls were selected from the computerized birth registry and matched by gender, gear and month of birth. Subjects and setting: A list of all the children diagnosed with FAS from the North Dakota FAS Registry was sent to the State Health Department. We were able to locate the birth certificates for 132 (56%) of the 228 cases on the registry. Results: Of the 132 FAS cases, 106 (80.3%) were Native Americans and 24 (18.2%) were Caucasians. In this sample 51 (38.6%) of the cases were male and 81 (61.4%) were female. Statistically significant maternal characteristics at p < 0.01 were: older mother's age, lower education level, fewer months of prenatal care, fewer prenatal visits, lower gestational age at time of delivery and less prenatal weight gain. Significant neonatal differences at p < 0.01 were lower birth weight and Apgar scores and higher incidence of congenital malformations. Conclusion: FAS is a completely preventable developmental disability. Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can result in lifelong physical and mental impairments on the fetus. All pregnant women should be screened for alcohol use during prenatal visits. Women with positive screens or at high risk should be identified early by the primary care physician and referred for treatment and counseling.

N2  - Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome in the end of the 1960s, substantial evidence has accumulated on a number of adverse effects that alcohol consumption during pregnancy may have on the fetus. Long-term effects on child development has also been observed. Although the various types of effects are well documented, less is known about threshold levels of consumption, under which there is no risk of damage. Few studies have assessed the risk associated with high episodic drinking. From a theoretical point of view, binge drinking in critical stages in organ formation may constitute a particularly high risk for adverse outcomes.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-regnan-20-one) is a neuroactive steroid recently shown to be involved in the neurochemical stress response via its positive modulation of the GABA(A) receptor complex. This experiment investigated the effects of postnatal stress (daily maternal separation during the first week of life) on the subsequent adult response to a stressor (10 min forced swim) in Long-Evans rats from one of three prenatal treatment groups (alcohol, pair-fed and control). Indices of stress response were allopregnanolone concentrations in plasma, cortex and hippocampus, and dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations in prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum. Females had higher levels of allopregnanolone than males in both plasma and brain. Prenatal alcohol exposure combined with early maternal separation stress resulted in an increase in the endogenous levels of allopregnanolone in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of adult offspring in response to a stressor compared to subjects without a prior history of postnatal stress; this effect was greater in females. This increased allopregnanolone was also associated with decreased dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the prefrontal cortex. In the prenatal alcohol-exposed offspring, postnatal maternal separation blunted the increase in dopamine levels in the striatum seen in both control groups, postnatal maternal separation increased norepinephrine levels in the nucleus accumbens regardless of prenatal experience, while in the prefrontal cortex only prenatal diet condition (pair-feeding and alcohol) resulted in lower norepinephrine levels. The results of this experiment suggest that experience, both pre- and postnatal, can have long-term consequences for the developing neurochemical responses to stressors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize for clinicians recent epidemiologic evidence regarding medical risks of alcohol use for women. METHODS: MEDLINE and PsychINFO, 1990 through 1996, were searched using key words 'women' or 'woman,' and 'alcohol.' MEDLINE was also searched for other specific topics and authors from 1980 through 1996. Data were extracted and reviewed regarding levels of alcohol consumption associated with mortality, cardiovascular disease, alcohol-related liver disease, injury, osteoporosis, neurologic symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, fetal alcohol syndrome, spontaneous abortion, infertility, menstrual symptoms, breast cancer, and gynecologic malignancies. Gender-specific data from cohort studies of general population or large clinical samples are primarily reviewed. MAIN RESULTS: Women develop many alcohol-related medical problems at lower levels of consumption than men, probably reflecting women's lower total body water, gender differences in alcohol metabolism, and effects of alcohol on postmenopausal estrogen levels. Mortality and breast cancer are increased in women who report drinking more than two drinks daily. Higher levels of alcohol consumption by women are associated with increased menstrual symptoms, hypertension, and stroke. Women who drink heavily also appear to have increased infertility and spontaneous abortion. Adverse fetal effects occur after variable amounts of alcohol consumption, making any alcohol use during pregnancy potentially harmful. CONCLUSIONS: In general, advising nonpregnant women who drink alcohol to have fewer than two drinks dally is strongly supported by the epidemiologic literature, although specific recommendations for a particular woman should depend on her medical history and risk factors.

T1  - Prevention of alcohol abuse-related birth effects - I. Public education efforts
A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can result in a pattern of anomalies in children called 'fetal alcohol syndrome' (FAS) and more recently, 'fetal alcohol abuse syndrome (FAAS)'. FAAS as well as individual alcohol-related anomalies, called 'alcohol abuse-related birth effects' (AARBEs), are widely considered to be totally preventable, because they stem from a behaviour that is presumably modifiable. However, current strategies to reduce their occurrence are more palliative than preventive, because their underlying premise, viz. that raising public awareness of the potential dangers of commonly used substances such as alcohol is enough to reduce their use, lacks empirical support. Moreover, in some cases they are also counter-productive. After considering the relevant literature, this review contends that 'universal' public education efforts will only be effective in reducing FAAS and AARBEs if they focus on the cause of these disorders, which is alcohol abuse rather than the currently open-ended message that any amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy constitutes a danger to an unborn child. This argument lays the ground work for an alternative and more pragmatic strategy set forth in the following paper for preventing FAAS and AARBEs.

N2  - Objective: To examine the relative importance of prenatal alcohol exposure and family history of alcoholism for the prediction of adolescent alcohol problems. Method: In 1974-75, a population-based, longitudinal prospective study of alcohol and pregnancy began with self-report of alcohol use by pregnant women. In a 14-year follow-up, 439 parents provided information on the family history of alcohol problems for these adolescent offspring. The 14-year-old adolescents provided information on the frequency and quantity of their own alcohol consumption within the past month, on the consequences of their drinking over the past 3 years, and on their age at first intoxication. Additional covariates were assessed prenatally and at follow-up. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was more predictive of adolescent alcohol use and its negative consequences than was family history of alcohol problems. Prenatal exposure retained a significant predictive effect even after adjustment for family history and other prenatal and environmental covariates. By contrast, the nominally significant correlation of family history with adolescent drinking is weaker after adjustment for prenatal alcohol exposure and disappears entirely after adjustment for other relevant covariates. We observed no evidence for an interactive effect of fetal exposure and family history in predicting adolescent alcohol use. Conclusions: Fetal alcohol exposure is a risk factor for adolescent alcohol involvement and alcohol-related problems and may account for variance in prediction of problems otherwise attributed to family history of alcoholism. Studies of alcoholism etiology and family history need to include consideration of even modest levels of fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - This study was designed to test the hypothesis that nitric oxide (NO) mediates the blunted splenic sympathetic response to lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) that occurs in young rats exposed to alcohol in utero (FAE). The subjects, 26-29-day-old rats, were progeny of pregnant dams fed an alcohol diet (35% of the calories were derived from ethanol) or their control and pair-fed (PFC) cohorts. We examined the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.5 mg/kg, IP) on splenic norepinephrine (NE) turnover, an index of sympathetic neural activity, splenic inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein immunoreactivity, and NO metabolites nitrite/nitrate concentrations in plasma. In response to LPS, splenic NE turnover was increased by more than twofold in the PFC groups, but the increase did not occur in their FAE cohorts. The blockade of NOS with L-NAME (30 mg/kg, IP) reversed this difference. In both the PFC and FAE rats, basal levels of splenic iNOS protein immunoreactivity were equally barely detected and plasma NO metabolite levels were relatively low (25 muM in both groups). In response to LPS, however, iNOS protein displayed a marked increase in the PFC group and an even greater increase (by close to threefold) in the FAE rats. LPS also substantially increased plasma NO metabolite levels by close to eight-fold in the control groups, but by 15-fold in their FAE cohorts compared to the basal levels. These findings support the hypothesis that in the FAE rat, an augmented NO formation accounts for the blunted sympathetic response to endotoxin.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Prospective studies of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on development have focused primarily on the detection of subtle deficits. This study was designed to extend those findings by evaluating does-response, functional significance, and pattern of drinking in greater detail. 480 African-American infants, recruited to overrepresent prenatal exposure at moderate-to-heavy levels, were assessed. For the five outcomes tested, nonparametric and hockey stick regression analyses both indicated essentially no relation between pregnancy drinking and developmental outcome below a median threshold of 0.5 oz absolute alcohol/day, with the impact of the exposure increasing gradually above threshold. Functional deficit was defined in terms of performance in the bottom 10th percentile of the distribution. For four of the five outcomes tested, there was no increased incidence of functionally significant deficit in infants born to moderate-to-heavy drinking mothers <30 years old, whereas those born to older drinking mothers were 2 to 5 times more likely to be functionally impaired. Among the infants exposed above threshold, functionally significant deficits were seen primarily in those whose mothers averaged at least 5 drinks/occasion on an average of at least once/week. By contrast, a history of alcohol abuse was not related to functional deficit. These data suggest that efforts to reduce the incidence of alcohol-related functional impairment should specifically target the older mother who engages in intermittent heavy drinking during pregnancy.

N2  - This research aimed to develop a Fetal Alcohol Behavior Scale (FABS) that describes the behavioral essence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), regardless of age, race, sex, and IQ. Using a reference sample of 472 diagnosed patients with FAS or FAE, ages 2 to 51, five studies are described. The FABS demonstrates high item-to-scale reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91) and good test-retest reliability (r = 0.69) over an average interval of 5 years. It identifies many of the subjects with known or presumed prenatal alcohol exposure in detection studies using both prison and general samples. FABS scores also predict dependent living among adult patients with FAS/FAE. The FABS is uncorrelated with IQ, sex, age, race, and diagnosis (FAS versus FAE). We outline areas of further work to define the specificity and utility of this FABS.

T1  - Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological mechanisms involved in central nervous system dysfunctions induced by prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Guerri C.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - One of the most severe consequences of maternal ethanol consumption is the damage to the developing central nervous system, which is manifested by long-term cognitive and behavioral deficits in the offspring. Prenatal exposure to ethanol affects many crucial neurochemical and cellular components of the developing brain. Ethanol interferes with all of the stages of brain development, and the severity of the damage depends on the amount of ethanol intake and level of exposure. Experimental observations also indicate that the toxic effects of ethanol are not uniform: some brain regions are more affected than others and, even within a given region, some cell populations are more vulnerable than others. The neocortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum are the regions in which the neurotoxic effects of ethanol have been associated with the behavioral deficits. At the cellular level, ethanol disrupts basic developmental processes, including interference with division and proliferation, cell growth, and differentiation and the migration of maturing cells. Alterations in astroglia development and in neuronal-glial interactions may also influence the development of the nervous system. An impairment of several neurotransmitter systems and/or their receptors, as well as changes in the endocrine environment during brain development, are also important factors involved in the behavioral dysfunctions observed after prenatal ethanol exposure. Finally, some molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced behavioral dysfunctions will be discussed.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and development at preschool age: Main results of a french study
A1  - Larroque B.
A1  - Kaminski M.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Very high levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are harmful for the central nervous system of the child and affect morphogenesis and growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on development at preschool age in a longitudinal study. Pregnant woman were interviewed on their alcohol consumption during pregnancy at their first visit to the maternity hospital of Roubeix, France. The development of their 160 children was assessed at the age of 4 1/2. Multiple regression analyses indicated that consumption of 1.5 oz of absolute alcohol (approximately 3 drinks) or more during pregnancy was significantly related to a decrease of 7 points on the general cognitive index of the McCarthy scales, after controlling for confounders. This level of consumption was also related to a higher score on minor neurological anomalies, a lower height of the child, and the higher score on facial features. This level of 1.5 oz of absolute alcohol/day should not be interpreted as a biological threshold, because the study does not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the effects of lower levels of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can affect the development of the child, at levels well below those associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a devastating developmental disorder caused by prenatal exposure to high amounts of alcohol. In addition to structural abnormalities and growth deficits, fetal alcohol syndrome is associated with a broad spectrum of neurobehavioral anomalies. This paper reviews the behavioral and cognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. More than 20 years of research are discussed, with a focus on IQ, activity, attention, learning, memory, language, motor, and visuospatial abilities in children prenatally exposed to varying amounts of alcohol, including those with fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) produces profound alterations in immunological and neuroendocrine functions. The present study examined the effects of FAE on the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and corticosterone following administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in normal (N) adult rats, in adult offspring of dams fed a liquid diet supplemented with ethanol (E), and in pair-fed control offspring (P). LPS-induced TNF-alpha secretion was not affected by either gender or prenatal treatment. In contrast, LPS-induced corticosterone secretion was significantly greater in female than in male rats, and at 60-min post-LPS was significantly higher in E and P, compared to N females. Ovariectomy significantly inhibited LPS- induced TNF-alpha secretion in E, but not in P and N, rats and chronic replacement with 17-beta-estradiol markedly inherited TNF-alpha secretion in ovariectomized E and N, but not in P, rats. In contrast, ovariectomy reduced the effects of LPS on corticosterone secretion in all groups, and chronic replacement with 17-beta-estradiol reversed this effect. These findings indicate that LPS-induced secretion of corticosterone, but not TNF-alpha, is affected by prenatal manipulations and by gender. In addition, alterations in the hormonal environment in females modulate LPS-induced corticosterone secretion in all prenatal treatment groups, but differentially influence TNF- alpha secretion in rats exposed to alcohol, restricted feeding, or normal diets in utero.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The most devastating teratogenic effect of alcohol on the unborn child is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is a permanent birth defect that results in lifelong disruptions in cognitive, linguistic and social development. One of the most debilitating effects of prenatal alcohol exposure involves the development and use of social communication. Deficits in social communication jeopardize academic success and appear to play a major role in the maladaptive and dysfunctional behaviours present in older school-age children and adolescents with FAS. The ability to manage longer units of social discourse is a defining feature of adolescent language. Narratives are extended texts that occur frequently in the language of the classroom and in a variety of meaningful social contexts. The demands of narratives provide clinicians with a window of opportunity from which to examine the social-communicative processes of youngsters with FAS. In this paper we introduce an experimental protocol that has been designed to sample narrative discourse using a wordless picture book as the eliciting stimulus. Spoken narratives are scored for their cohesion (i.e. linking related events into logical networks) and coherence (i.e. informativeness). The clinical utility of the protocol is demonstrated and discussed, with a case presentation of two adolescents with FAS and a sample of typically developing peers.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: A Japanese perspective
A1  - Tanaka H.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - To estimate and prevent the effects of prenatal alcohol on the central nervous system (CNS), brain dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE) was compared by both epidemiological and experimental studies. The FAS infants exhibited a more severe degree of CNS involvement than the FAE infants. The CNS involvement features were developmental delay and intellectual impairment in both FAS and FAE. The increased risk of low birth weight and CNS involvement were much more significant in women who were heavy drinkers or alcoholics and smoked. The beneficial effect of supplementary zinc on the fetal cerebrum of FAS or FAE rats was limited, never reaching the unexposed control level. One of the most vulnerable structures in the rat fetus exposed to ethanol in utero was the synaptic formation in the hippocampus. The consistent dysmorphogenesis of synapses during early brain development may be associated with the functional impairment of the CNS in FAS and FAE.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with behavioral and cognitive deficits. However, the majority of children born to alcohol-abusing women do not meet the formal criteria for FAS and it is not known if the cognitive abilities of these children differ from those of children with FAS. Using a set of neuropsychological tests, 3 groups were compared: (a) children with FAS, (b) children without FAS who were born to alcohol-abusing women (the PEA group), and (c) normal controls. The results indicated that, relative to controls, both the FAS and the PEA groups were impaired on tests of language, verbal learning and memory, academic skills, fine-motor speed, and visual- motor integration. These data suggest that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a consistent pattern of neuropsychological deficits and the degree of these deficits may be independent of the presence of physical features associated with FAS.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - A series of 22 women who suffered from mushroom poisoning while pregnant have been identified among adults receiving treatment between 1960 and 1993 in a specialist clinic in Budapest, Hungary. In most cases, the poisonings were attributed to Amanita phalloides, verna, and related species. Of these, 20 went to term, and data were collected on gestational age, birth weight, and both major and minor congenital anomalies. Mean birth weight (but not gestational age) was lower than in the control series, suggesting that maternal poisoning may have led to intrauterine growth retardation. Two children were identified with major abnormalities (one of whom had fetal alcohol syndrome related to alcohol abuse by the mother). The prevalences of both major and minor anomalies were similar to the prevalence in the matched control group and to the rate in a more recent control series examined according to the same protocols. However, the statistical power to detect teratogenic effects is limited, especially as only five of the mothers suffered the poisoning episode during the first trimester.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between light-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and congenital renal anomalies. METHODS: Data from the population-based Atlanta Birth Defects Case-Control Study were used to examine the association between selected renal anomalies and self-reported maternal alcohol consumption during the period from 1 month before through 3 months after conception. Case infants were ascertained by a population-based birth defects registry with active case ascertainment; the case group consisted of 158 infants, born during 1968 through 1980 to metropolitan Atlanta residents, in whom these renal anomalies had been diagnosed. Two control groups were used. One had 3029 infants without birth defects, and the other had 4633 infants with birth defects exclusive of the urinary tract who were born during the same period. RESULTS: Overall, there was a moderate association between renal anomalies and moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.3). When the renal anomalies were subclassified, moderate prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated only with renal agenesis or hypoplasia (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.1), and within this group only infants with bilateral defects and other major anomalies in addition to renal agenesis or hypoplasia had significantly elevated risks. There were no significant associations between reported light consumption and any category of the selected renal anomalies. No conclusions could be reached for reported heavy consumption because of sparse data. Adjustments for potential confounding factors did not alter these results. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy may increase a woman's risk of giving birth to a child with renal agenesis or hypoplasia.

N2  - Glial cells constitute one of the most common cell types in the brain. They play critical roles in central nervous system (CNS) development. Recent evidence demonstrates that glial cells are profoundly affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, suggesting that alterations in these cells may participate in CNS abnormalities associated with ethanol-induced teratogenesis. In vivo studies show that prenatal exposure to alcohol hampers myelinogenesis and is associated with neuroglial heterotopias and abnormal astrogliogenesis. Studies using primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes show that ethanol affects DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, decreases the number of mitotic cells, alters the content and distribution of several cytoskeletal proteins including the astroglial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the levels of plasma-membrane glycoproteins, reduces the capacity of astrocytes to secrete growth factors, and induces oxidative stress. Furthermore, ethanol exposure during early embryogenesis alters the normal development of radial glia cells (the main astrocytic precursors), delays the onset of GFAP expression, and decreases mRNA GFAP levels in fetal and postnatal brains and in radial glia and astrocytes in primary culture. Recent evidence suggests that ethanol interferes with the transcription process of GFAP, thus leading to a reduction in GFAP-gene expression during astrogliogenesis. However, brief exposure of rats to high levels of ethanol during the neonatal period (the period of astrocyte differentiation) causes a transient gliosis, with an increase in GFAP and its mRNA levels. These findings indicate that astroglial cells are an important target of ethanol toxicity during central nervous system (CNS) development.

T1  - Surveillance for fetal alcohol syndrome using multiple sources -- Atlanta, Georgia, 1981-1989
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy and is characterized by specific anomalies of the face; prenatal and postnatal growth deficits; and a variety of central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, including mental retardation. Children with either full or partial FAS often incur severe and costly secondary disabilities. Despite the importance of surveillance for establishing the magnitude of FAS and in monitoring trends in the occurrence of this disease, population-based surveillance for FAS has been difficult because the syndrome can be diagnosed only by clinical observation and often is not recognized until after the child reaches school age. Although most FAS surveillance has been based on diagnoses among newborns, most (89%) cases (full FAS and partial FAS) are diagnosed after the age of 6 years. To develop a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of FAS in a defined population, in 1997 CDC linked data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) and the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP) for children born in Atlanta during 1981-1989 (the most recent birth year for which data were available for 3-10-year-olds). This report presents a multiple-source method for FAS surveillance that is more complete than previous methods and that enables comparison of rates between states.

T1  - Alcohol consumption among pregnant and childbearing-aged women--United States, 1991 and 1995
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Moderate to heavy alcohol use by women during pregnancy has been associated with many severe adverse effects in their children, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)--with facial dysmorphology, growth retardation, and central nervous system deficits--and other neurodevelopmental effects. Early prenatal alcohol exposure can occur unintentionally (i.e., before a woman knows she is pregnant); in addition, women who drink at high levels before pregnancy are at increased risk for drinking during pregnancy. Ongoing surveillance for alcohol consumption among pregnant and childbearing-aged women is important for monitoring the impact of efforts to prevent this risk behavior. This report analyzes and compares data from the 1995 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and previously reported 1991 BRFSS data for women aged 18-44 years, and presents the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women and overall and state-specific prevalence rates among women of childbearing age. The findings indicate a substantial increase in alcohol use among pregnant women from 1991 to 1995.

N2  - The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) utilizes a population-based survey of Oklahoma women with a recent live birth to examine the rates of alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. Nearly one-half of Oklahoma women report using alcohol during the three months before pregnancy and one in thirteen women consume alcohol during the three months prior to delivery. Moderate to heavy alcohol use before pregnancy was associated with additional perinatal risk factors including unintended pregnancy, inadequate prenatal care, smoking, and physical abuse. Health providers play an important role in the prevention of alcohol related birth impairments such as fetal alcohol syndrome through early detection of problem drinking, patient education and appropriate referrals. However, one in four Oklahoma mothers report their health care provider did not talk to them about the harmful effects alcohol can have on their baby.

T1  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure

N2  - Exposure to alcohol during gestation can cause persistent abnormalities in physical and cognitive development. Children who meet the clinical definition of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) are small for their age, exhibit characteristic facial anomalies, and demonstrate deficits in central nervous system development. Alcohol effects in children with prenatal exposure, but not FAS, are similar, although of smaller magnitude and not necessarily present in all three systems. The degree to which a person is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure depends on the amount, timing, and duration of the mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy as well as maternal characteristics (e.g., age and comorbid psychiatric disorders) and environmental factors (e.g., socioeconomic status and family problems). Some exposure-related effects, such as growth deficits, are directly related to the amount of alcohol consumed, however, so that even a small amount of alcohol may affect child development. Therefore, the best policy continues to be abstinence during pregnancy.

T1  - Ontogeny of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and anterior pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin expression in male and female offspring of alcohol-exposed and adrenalectomized dams

N2  - This study was designed to determine whether the previously described sexually dimorphic changes in rat hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and anterior pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA expression in response to fatal alcohol exposure (FAE) are present prepubertally and whether they are altered by maternal adrenalectomy. Hypothalamic CRF and anterior pituitary POMC mRNA levels were determined in male and female offspring of adrenalectomized (ADX) and sham-adrenalectomized (Sham) dams exposed to alcohol (FAE) or a pair-fed (PF) control diet during the last 2 weeks of gestation. CRF and POMC mRNA levels were measured by Northern blotting at 1, 7, 14, and 21 days of age. In offs wing of control PF dams, CRF mRNA levels increased faster in females, increasing by day 7, followed by a decrease at days 14 and 21, whereas in males there was a gradual increase from days 1 to 21. FAE altered the ontogenic profile of CRF mRNA in female offspring by delaying and exaggerating the rise of CRF expression to day 14, but produced no effect in males. Maternal adrenalectomy, combined with FAE, resulted in an early rise of CRF mRNA on day 14 in male offspring. In females, the combined ADX/FAE treatment resulted insignificantly increased CRF mRNA levels, compared with those of ADX/PF off-spring, on days 7 and 14. By day 21, these differences in CRF mRNA levels between the ADX/FAE and ADX/PF offspring had disappeared. POMC mRNA levels generally increased by day 7, followed by a dramatic decrease by day 14 and another increase by day 21. FAE male offspring showed decreased levels of POMC mRNA, whereas females were not affected. Maternal adrenalectomy reversed this inhibition in male offspring, resulting in POMC mRNA levels similar to those measured in male offspring of PF control animals. In contrast, POMC mRNA levels of female offspring of ADX dams decreased in response to FAE. These data suggest that the previously observed switch from suppressed to enhanced POMC expression in FAE males is the result of developmental events beyond weaning. Because this sexually dimorphic regulation of CRF and POMC expression by prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal adrenalectomy occurs before the presence of adult levels of sex steroids, this suggests an organizational effect on the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function.

N2  - Considerable variation in offspring outcome is observed after intrauterine alcohol exposure. The underlying mechanism may include genetic diversity in the enzymes responsible for alcohol metabolism. Of the known genetic polymorphisms, differences at the alcohol dehydrogenase-2 locus (ADH2) are likely most critical because the resulting enzymes are >30-fold different in their kinetic constants. To test whether differences in maternal or offspring ADH2 genotype are determinants of risk for alcohol-related birth defects, maternal-infant pairs (n = 243) were enrolled on the basis of maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy and maternal ADH2 genotype. Infant outcome was measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development Mental Index (MDI) at 12 months of age. Drinking during pregnancy was associated with lower MDI scores but only in the offspring of mothers without an ADH2*3 allele (P < .01, analysis of variance, post hoc). The offspring of drinking women with at least one ADH2*3 allele had MDI scores Similar to those of nondrinking women of either ADH2 genotype. Lower MDI scores were associated with the three-way interaction among increasing alcohol intake and maternal and offspring absence of the ADH2*3 allele (P < .01, multiple linear regression). We suggest that the protection afforded by this allele is secondary to its encoding of the high-K(m)/high-V(max) ADH beta3 isoenzyme, which would provide more efficient alcohol metabolism at high blood alcohol concentrations. These observations are supportive of alcohol, rather that acetaldehyde, being the more important proximate teratogen and are the first observations of a specific genetic explanation for susceptibility differences to alcohol-related birth defects.

N2  - Objective: To assess general intellectual functioning in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with or without the facial features and growth deficiencies characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Design: Forty-seven alcohol-exposed children were recruited on evaluation at a dysmorphology clinic and evaluated as part of a university research project using standard tests of IQ. Thirty-four of the alcohol- exposed patients met the traditional diagnostic criteria for FAS. The other 13 alcohol-exposed children lacked both the pattern of facial features and prenatal or postnatal growth deficiency characteristic of the diagnosis. Results: Compared with normal control subjects matched for age, sex, and ethnicity, both groups of alcohol-exposed children displayed significant deficits in overall IQ measures and deficits on most of the subtest scores. Although those in the nondysmorphic group usually obtained marginally higher IQ scores than those in the FAS group, few significant differences were found between the two alcohol-exposed groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that high levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are related to an increased risk for deficits in intellectual functioning and that these can occur in children without all of the physical features required for a diagnosis of FAS. They also emphasize the need for conducting a thorough history of prenatal alcohol exposure in children with intellectual deficits.

N2  - We examined the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on serum prolactin levels and on the ability of the D2 dopamine antagonist sulpiride to stimulate prolactin release in Long-Evans rats. Pregnant rats were intubated with alcohol (0, 3, or 5 g/kg/day) from gestational day 8 (GD8) to GD20. Adult female offspring were screened for estrous cycle stage. At diestrus, the rats were challenged with a single dose of sulpiride (0, 10, or 40 mug/kg) and trunk blood was collected 20 min later. After prenatal exposure to either dose of alcohol, mean basal serum levels of prolactin were about 65% less than the 0 g/kg group, and the 35-40% mean differences from an untreated control group were not significant. Sulpiride produced dramatic dose-dependent increases in serum prolactin levels in all prenatal treatment groups. Across all doses of sulpiride, the group given the higher dose of prenatal alcohol (5 g/kg/day) had significantly lower serum prolactin levels than all other groups. There was no significant interaction between prenatal treatment and sulpiride dose. Neither prenatal alcohol exposure nor sulpiride injections had significant effects on serum corticosterone levels in this study. Although the current results are unclear regarding a baseline decrease in prolactin levels after prenatal alcohol exposure, the overall results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure decreases prolactin levels but there is no evidence that it does so by altering dopaminergic tone in hypothalamus of female rats.

N2  - Exposure to ethanol during fetal development reduces the astroglial- specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and its mRNA levels in brains of fetal rats and in radial gila in primary culture, affecting the proliferation and differentiation of astrocytes. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the possible effect of ethanol on GFAP mRNA levels in astrocytes and to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) involved in ethanol- induced changes in GFAP expression by analyzing the GFAP transcription rate, GFAP mRNA stability, and GFAP DNA methylation. We show here that prenatal exposure to ethanol reduces significantly GFAP immunoreactivity and its mRNA levels in both astrocytes in primary culture and brains of pups from alcohol- fed mothers. Runoff experiments from nuclei of astrocytes indicate that ethanol exposure decreases GFAP transcription rate significantly and reduces GFAP mRNA stability slightly. DNA methylation analysis indicates that prenatal ethanol exposure induces a hypermethylated state of the GFAP DNA in fetal brains. Methylation-mediated repression of GFAP transcription could be a mechanism involved in ethanol-induced reduction of GFAP expression. Ethanol-induced alterations in GFAP expression and astroglial development may underlie the CNS dysfunctions observed after prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Previous work has established a number of sex-related deficits in immune function, behavior, and endocrine responses to stress in the offspring of darns exposed to ethanol. To examine the potential role of maternal glucocorticoids as a mediator of these sexually dimorphic effects in the fetus, we examined the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure in the presence or absence of maternal glucocorticoids on fetal plasma corticosterone (CORT) production. An additional question to be addressed by these studies was whether maternal adrenalectomy could eliminate the known inhibition by ethanol of the prenatal surge of plasma testosterone in male fetuses. Pregnant dams were adrenalectomized (ADX) or sham-adrenalectomized on gestational day (G) 7 and placed on a liquid diet containing 35% ethanol- derived calories or pair-fed an isocaloric control diet throughout the experiment. On G18, G19, and G21, plasma levels of CORT, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were measured in male and female fetuses and their mothers. Ethanol administration consistently increased maternal plasma CORT levels but did not significantly alter CORT levels in the fetus. Maternal ADX resulted in compensatory increases in fetal CORT levels that were lower in fetuses of ADX dams on alcohol, suggesting a direct effect of ethanol on fetal pituitary-adrenal activity. There were no significant sex differences in fetal plasma CORT levels in response to any of these manipulations. A novel surge of maternal plasma DHEA was found on G19 that was absent in plasma from ADX dams. In spite of the absence of a surge on G19, plasma DHEA levels of ADX dams rose from very low levels at G18 to levels on G21 that were significantly higher than in Sham dams. A normal testosterone surge was observed in male fetuses on G18 and G19 from sham- adrenalectomized dams administered the pair-fed diet. However, this surge was greatly attenuated in males administered ethanol and also in male fetuses from ADX dams. These results reveal a direct inhibitory influence of ethanol on fetal CORT secretion as well as on the prenatal testosterone surge in males. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate the presence of a surge of DHEA in the pregnant rat. Overall, these data suggest that there is a critical adrenal factor in the rat that regulates the maternal surge of DHEA on G19 and the prenatal testosterone surge of male fetuses on G18-19.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - PURPOSE: Heavy drinking during pregnancy is an established risk factor for fetal alcohol syndrome and other adverse perinatal outcomes. However, there is still debate as to the effects of low-to-moderate drinking during pregnancy. METHODS: This prospective investigation was based on 2714 singleton live births at Yale-New Haven Hospital during 1988-1992. Alcohol drinking during pregnancy was evaluated with respect to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preterm delivery, and low birthweight. RESULTS: Mild drinking, defined as > 0.10-0.25 oz of absolute alcohol per day, during the first month of pregnancy was associated with a protective effect on IUGR (OR, 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.76). Overall, drinking during month I of pregnancy suggested a curvilinear effect on growth retardation, with consumption of > 1.00 oz of absolute alcohol per day showing increased risk. Drinking during month 7 was associated with a uniform increase in the odds of preterm delivery; the ORs were 2.88 (95%'CI, 1.64-5.05) for light drinking and 2.96 (95% CI, 1.32-6.67) for mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the risk estimates for IUOR and preterm delivery may indicate etiological differences that Warrant further investigation of these outcomes and critical periods of exposure. Low birthweight is not a useful neonatal outcome for this exposure because it is a heterogeneous mix of preterm delivery and IUGR. Despite the observed protective effects of mild drinking on IUGR, the increased risk of preterm delivery with alcohol use supports a policy of abstinence during pregnancy.

T1  - DNA damage, DNA repair, and alcohol toxicity - A review
A1  - Brooks P.J.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Alcohol (ethanol) is clearly a toxic substance when consumed in excess. Chronic alcohol abuse results in a variety of pathological effects, including damage to the liver and brain, as well as other organs, and is associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancers. Alcohol consumption by pregnant women can result in fetal alcohol effects and fetal alcohol syndrome. All of these toxic effects are well documented. What is needed at present is a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which alcohol causes these toxic effects. Such an understanding may lead to better treatments of some of these toxic effects. This review, focuses on the possibility that toxic effects of ethanol are mediated at least in part, by damage to DNA. In particular, I emphasize data on the production of endogenous DNA-damaging molecules as a result of alcohol consumption and metabolism. Specific examples of DNA-damaging molecules to be considered are reactive oxygen species, including oxygen radicals, lipid peroxidation products, and acetaldehyde. The relevant DNA repair pathways that protect cells against DNA damage produced by these molecules will also be reviewed. The goal of this review is to integrate recent results from the fields of mutagenesis and DNA repair with the alcohol toxicity literature, with the aim of stimulating research into the role of DNA damage in different types of alcohol toxicity and the role of DNA repair in protecting cells from alcohol related damage.

T1  - Morphometric analysis of the postnatal mouse optic nerve following prenatal exposure to alcohol

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Pregnant female mice were divided on day 12 post coitum into a control and an experimental group. The experimental group was given a single intraperitoneal dose of 0.015 ml/g body weight of 25% solution of alcohol in distilled water while the control group was exposed to a similar weight related dose of normal saline. The optic nerves were isolated from the offspring of both control and experimental groups at wk 2, 3 and 5 (i.e. during the juvenile period of postnatal development) and analysed by light and electron microscopy. Although in both groups the optic nerve grew in size rapidly during the period studied, the rate of growth in the experimental groups lagged behind that of the controls. The difference was initially significant but tailed off, so that by wk 5 it was no longer significant. The time of initial onset and progression of myelinogenesis in the optic nerve of alcohol exposed mice also lagged behind that of controls. In both groups the size distribution of the myelinated nerve fibres in the optic nerve was unimodal with a positive skewing for all ages. The spectrum of size distribution of the nerve fibres was, however, broader in controls than in the corresponding experimental groups. With increasing age the proportion of small and medium size fibres was greater in the experimental group than in the controls, while for the large diameter fibres the reverse was observed. It is suggested that this study may shed light on the teratogenic effect of 'binge' drinking during pregnancy and that it is the critical period when exposure occurs that is more important than the duration of administration.

N2  - Objective: To examine the association of moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure with learning and behavior in early adolescence. Method: A population-based cohort of 464 children were followed longitudinally from birth to age 14 years. Alcohol exposure was assessed via in-depth maternal self-report in the fifth month of pregnancy. At age 14, learning and behavior were assessed with multiple measures, tapping parent, teenager, and psychologist viewpoints, drawn from adolescent laboratory examination and parent phone interview. The underlying pattern of association between prenatal alcohol and adolescent outcome was detected using partial least- squares statistical techniques; confounding factors were dealt with by regression methods. Results: Analyses revealed a statistically significant, subtle relationship between greater prenatal alcohol use and increased behavior/learning difficulties during adolescence, even after accounting for other developmental influences. 'Binge' maternal drinking and exposure early in pregnancy were associated with a profile of adolescent antisocial behavior, school problems, and self-perceived learning difficulties. Conclusions: Fetal alcohol exposure (even at 'social drinking' levels) is associated with developmental difficulties in adolescence that are consistent with problems seen earlier in life. Clinicians should understand the potential role prenatal alcohol exposure plays in behavioral and cognitive problems.

N2  - Research has shown variations in susceptibility to alcohol-related birth defects in humans. Genetic differences are one reason for this variability. This study compared three inbred mouse strains to determine whether they differ in their susceptibilities to ethanol teratogenesis because previous studies have generated conflicting data. Pregnant C5BL/6J (B6), DBA/2J (D2), and A/J (A) dams were intubated intragastrically with either an acute dose of ethanol (5.8 g/kg) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrine on day 9 of pregnancy. Litters were removed on day 18 of pregnancy and examined for gross, soft-tissue, and skeletal malformations. Results showed that ethanol- exposed B6 litters had a higher percentage of digit (19%), kidney (24%), and skeletal (32%, mostly vertebral) malformations than their maltose-exposed controls (7% or below. Prenatal exposure to ethanol increased skeletal (68%, both rib and vertebral) malformations for A litters when compared to their maltose-exposed controls (4%), but did not increase digit or kidney malformations. Ethanol-exposed D2 litters did not differ from maltose- exposed controls. Maternal blood ethanol levels did not differ among the B6, D2, and A strains. These results provide additional evidence suggesting a genetic component to ethanol teratogenesis.

N2  - Circulating horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as a tracer to determine if the blood-brain barrier to protein was altered by dietary prenatal alcohol exposure. Animals were prepared for light microscopic visualization of HRP after HRP infusion on gestational days 16, 18, 20, 22 and postnatal day 4. There was no consistent evidence of HRP leakage through the BBB in the alcohol-exposed animals compared to control animals. Capillary endothelial cells and perivascular astrocytic endfeet were morphologically characterized by electron microscopy in rat optic nerve and cerebellum following dietary prenatal and postnatal ethanol exposure. Phothomontages of optic nerve capillaries from G20 and P5 animals and cerebellar capillaries from P15 animals were examined for evidences of effects of alcohol on the development of the capillaries and adjacent astroglial endfeet. There was no consistent evidence of any alcohol-induced effects that could indicate a disruption of the vessel, the endothelial tight junctions, the perivascular glial limiting membranes, or the extent of vascular ensheathment by astrocytic endfeet.

T1  - Variation in induction of human placental CYP2E1: Possible role in susceptibility to fetal alcohol syndrome?
A1  - Rasheed A.
A1  - Hines R.N.
A1  - McCarver-May D.G.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in less than 10% of women who drink heavily during pregnancy. One potential mechanism for this intersubject variation is differences in placental alcohol metabolism, Alcohol dehydrogenase is present at low concentrations in the placenta and is not inducible. CYP2E1 has not been found in human placentas at early gestation time points or in random term placentas. Hepatic CYP2E1 is induced by alcohol and other environmental agents, but induction varies among heavy drinkers and may be genetically controlled. To test whether CYP2E1 is induced in placenta by heavy drinking during pregnancy, we performed a Western blot analysis on placental microsomes from women (n = 8) whose periconceptional average daily absolute alcohol intake was greater than 1 ounce. Using anti-human CYP2E1, bands consistent with CYP2E1 were identified in six samples, although considerable variation among individuals was observed. Among drinking mothers, offspring head size was smaller among those with placental CYP-2E1 (p = 0.04). The association between the presence of the protein and smaller birth weight and birth length was equivocal (p = 0.09). Our data are consistent with placental CYP2E1 being inducible by drinking, but with induction being variable among heavy drinking women. We speculate intersubject variation in induction may have a genetic basis and may play a role in susceptibility to alcohol related defects.

T1  - Alterations in the estrogen sensitivity of hypothalamic proenkephalin mRNA expression with age and prenatal exposure to alcohol

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Studies suggest that exposure to alcohol in utero causes reproductive and neuroendocrine deficits in adult female rats. The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) is an estrogen-sensitive brain region which is regarded as a primary locus for modulating female reproduction. Proenkephalin (PE) mRNA expression in the VMN is dramatically increased by estrogen and this elevation is thought to be involved in modulating female reproductive behavior and neuroendocrine function. To examine whether prenatal alcohol exposure has long-term effects on the ability of estrogen to influence hypothalamic PE mRNA levels, female rats at 2-3, 6-7 or 15-18 months of age, derived from alcohol- or control-fed dams, were studied. 7 days following ovariectomy, animals received either estrogen or sham treatment for 2 days prior to sacrifice. PE mRNA levels in the VMN and striatum were determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Film autoradiogram density, numbers of PE mRNA-expressing cells and exposed silver grains/cell were analyzed. Estrogen treatment increased hybridization density, the number of PE mRNA-expressing cells and PE mRNA (grains) level/cell in the VMN of normal adult female rats. In old rats, estrogen increased the number of PE mRNA-expressing cells without up-regulating PE mRNA grain density/cell. In fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) female rats, the number of cells that expressed PE mRNA did not increase following estrogen treatment at any age. Elevation of grain density/cell following estrogen was observed in FAE animals but only at 7-8 months of age. Overall, these data indicate that the estrogen responsiveness of PE mRNA expression in the VMN declines with age and, furthermore, prenatal exposure to alcohol blunts estrogen's effects on PE mRNA expression in the adult VMN. These finding may help to explain the mechanisms underlying the loss of reproductive function observed in FAE females.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure results in hyperactivity of the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis of the offspring: Modulation by fostering at birth and postnatal handling
A1  - Ogilvie K.M.
A1  - Rivier C.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Exposure of fetal rata to alcohol results in permanent hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In contrast, postnatal handling or fostering have been reported to restrain HPA activity. Because of the deleterious consequences of a hyperresponsive HPA axis, we thought that the possibility that postnatal manipulations might be able to reverse the influence of prenatal alcohol treatment deserved investigation. To test this hypothesis, we exposed rat dams to alcohol by inhalation during the second week of gestation. At birth, pups were either fostered or remained with their dam. For the first 3 weeks, litters were handled daily for 15 min or left undisturbed. At 22 days of age, male and female pups were decapitated under basal conditions, after 10 min of mild electro-footshock, or 10 min after footshock had been terminated. As expected, prenatal exposure to alcohol induced increased adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion in response to footshock, and postnatal handling of control pups resulted in a suppression of corticosterone and ACTH release, although changes in this latter hormone did not reach statistical significance. Surprisingly, however, pups exposed to alcohol that were also fostered and handled after birth, showed an ACTH response to footshock stress that was significantly larger than all other groups. This unexpected response may be due to alterations in maternal-pup behaviors and may indicate that these manipulations act on different neuronal substrates within the central HPA of young rats. Further studies are needed to determine whether adrenal regulation is also altered in animals exposed to alcohol prenatally and reared in a similar manner.

A1  - Lopez-Tejero D.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Background: Chronic alcoholism in pregnant animals and humans lead to general growth impairment in their offspring, which show multiple birth defects and delayed grown (fetal alcohol syndrome). Here we study the maturation of the intestine under the effect of chronic exposure to ethanol in utero together with associated malnutrition. Methods: Lactase, acid beta- galactosidase, maltase, and alkaline phosphatase activity profiles were monitored in 18-, 19-, 20-, and 21-day-old fetuses from rats kept under three nutritional treatments before and during gestation: alcohol-treated (25% ethanol in drinking water), fiber-treated (50% cellulose-diluted diet) as a control of the malnutrition associated with chronic alcoholism, and control or normal diet. Serum corticosterone determination and lactase immunolocalization were carried out. To detect possible direct effects of ethanol during the period of mucosa development, intestinal explants from 18- , 19-, and 20-day-old control fetuses were cultured either in the basal medium alone or in a medium containing 25 mM ethanol for 72, 48, and 24 h of incubation, respectively. Results: Following chronic ethanol exposure in utero, intestinal weight and brush-border protein content and the specific activities of lactase, acid beta-galactosidase, maltase, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly lower than those of nutritional controls. Organ culture results, under the assay conditions stated, did not show a direct effect of ethanol 25 mM on prenatal mucosal functionality. Conclusions: All these results suggest that maternal malnutrition is not primarily responsible for the impaired intestinal maturation in rat fetuses from alcohol-treated mothers; indirect effects of ethanol and/or its derivatives throughout embryo-fetal development could be necessary to promote this intestinal delay.

T1  - The teratogenic effects of alcohol following exposure during pregnancy, and its influence on the chromosome constitution of the pre-ovulatory egg
A1  - Kaufman M.H.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Much information has emerged over the years concerning the teratogenicity of acute and chronic alcohol exposure during pregnancy. Both alcohol and its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, are teratogenic. Exposure during pregnancy may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and this is said to occur in a substantial proportion of infants born to mothers who are chronic, heavy daily drinkers. Such infants usually survive to birth but are mentally retarded, often display growth retardation and additionally display a characteristic range of clinical features, principally craniofacial abnormalities and neurological damage. We have recently been interested in the effect of exposure of pregnant female mice to a single high level of alcohol during pregnancy, equivalent to an episode of 'binge' drinking, on the optic nerve, and believe that our findings, which are outlined in the first part of this review, may shed important light on the pathogenesis of some of the ocular features characteristically seen in infants with this syndrome. What is not generally appreciated, is that exposure to alcohol and other 'spindle-active' substances that have a similar action on the meiotic spindle apparatus during the menstrual cycle before conception can induce chromosome segregation errors in the ovulated oocyte. The successful fertilization of such eggs consequently results in the production of aneuploid embryos, which have a very high chance of being spontaneously aborted during the first trimester of pregnancy. Those relatively few aneuploid conceptuses that survive to term invariably show moderate to severe degrees of mental retardation, craniofacial and other abnormalities, as well as having a significantly reduced life expectancy. The findings from our experimental studies that have been carried out in mice draw attention to important principles which are of general applicability to the situation in the human. These findings, and our conclusions drawn from them, are discussed in detail in the second part of this review.

N2  - Behavioral deficits are often noted in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure, including mental retardation, learning problems, social problems, and deficits in attention. Because attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been diagnosed so frequently in children with FAS and other alcohol related birth defects, there has been speculation that alcohol is an etiological factor in ADHD. To examine the relationship between behavior characteristics of children with fetal alcohol exposure and those seen in children with a diagnosis of ADHD, 149 low socioeconomic status (SES), African-American children (mean age = 7.63 years) were given a battery of neuropsychological and behavioral tests. One hundred and twenty-two were a subsample from a longitudinal study of prenatal alcohol exposure, whereas twenty-seven were identified in an ADHD Clinic. Children were given two sets of teats: (1) 'traditional model' of conventional behavioral and psychiatric measures of ADHD and externalizing behavior; and (2) measures of neurocognitive functioning reflecting a four-factor model of the neurological basis of the components of attention (Mirsky AF, in Integrated Theory and Practice in Clinical Neuropsychology, Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1989). Results indicated that children with the physical characteristics associated with prenatal alcohol exposure and those with a diagnosis of ADHD had equivalent intellectual abilities with both clinical groups performing more poorly than contrast children from the same SES and ethnic groups. However, there were clear distinctions on behavioral and neurocognitive measures between the two clinical groups with those with ADHD performing more poorly on conventional tests sensitive to attentional problems and conduct disorder. When these two groups were compared on measures designed to measure the model of the four factors of attention by Mirsky, they were noted to have distinct patterns of deficits. These results suggested that the alcohol-affected children did not have the same neurocognitive and behavioral characteristics as children with a primary diagnosis of ADHD.

A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - One of the most frequently cited examples of ancient prescience concerning the potential dangers of drinking during pregnancy is the story of Samson in the Biblical Book of Judges. The present article examines the relevant passages from this and other related Biblical texts for indications that the ancient Hebrews were indeed aware of alcohol's potential to harm the fetus. This examination was then broadened to include a survey of later Talmudic literature relating to drinking during pregnancy, and literature from Sumerian, Hittite, and Egyptian cultures contemporary with those found in the Bible. No evidence was found for concern in the ancient Near East about any possible harm.

N2  - Alterations in the metabolism of arachidonic (20:4n-6), docosapentaenoic (22:5n-6), and docosahexaenoic (22:6n-3) acids and other polyunsaturated fatty acids in Zellweger syndrome and other peroxisomal disorders are reviewed. Previous proposals that peroxisomes are necessary for the synthesis of 22:6n-3 and 22:5n-6 are critically examined. The data suggest that 22:6n-3 is biosynthesized in mitochondria via a channelled carnitine-dependent pathway involving an n-3-specific DELTA-4 desaturase, while 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-6 are synthesized by both mitochondrial and microsomal systems; these pathways are postulated to be interregulated as compensatory-redundant systems. Present evidence suggests that 22:6n-3-containing phospholipids may be required for the biochemical events involved in successful neuronal migration and developmental morphogenesis, and as structural cofactors for the functional assembly and integration of a variety of membrane enzymes, receptors, and other proteins in peroxisomes and other subcellular organelles. A defect in the mitochondrial desaturation pathway is proposed to be a primary etiologic factor in the clinicopathology of Zellweger syndrome and other related disorders. Several implications of this proposal are examined relating to effects of pharmacological agents which appear to inhibit steps in this pathway, such as some hypolipidemics (fibrates), neuroleptics (phenothiazines and phenytoin) and prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol affects the morphological, structural, and functional features of the Golgi apparatus (GA), thus altering the glycosylation process in fetal hepatocytes. To elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying these alterations, we have studied the effect of alcohol exposure in utero on the activity of liver galactosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in the glycosylation process, and on the hepatic glycoprotein sugar composition. For this, livers from 21-day-old fetuses obtained from control and ethanol-fed rats were used. Galactosyltransferase (GT) activity was determined in isolated GA cis and trans fractions. Colloidal gold- labeled lectin cytochemistry was used to analyze sugar residues in hepatocytes at the subcellular level. Finally, the integrity of the GA after alcohol treatment was assessed by electron microscopy and by evaluating the distribution of the Golgi beta-COP, a protein involved in vesicular trafficking. Prenatal alcohol exposure induces a significant increase in both liver weight and total protein content in the trans Golgi. Moreover, this treatment decreases the activity of galactosyltransferase, increases alpha-L- Fuc residues, and reduces the number of alpha-Man, GlcNAc(beta1,4,Gl-cNAc)1,2, GalNAcalpha1,3GalNAc, alpha-GalNAc, and alpha-Gal residues. Alcohol exposure also causes the Golgi cisternae to disappear in about 30% of the hepatocytes, and reduces 75% the number of anti-Golgi beta-COP protein binding sites. Our results suggest that the decrease in galactosyltransferase activity, the alterations in the oligosaccharide chain composition, and the reduction in the amount of Golgi beta-COP protein could be involved in the alterations in the glycosylation process, as well as in the accumulation of hepatic proteins observed after prenatal alcohol exposure. These alterations could contribute, therefore, to the alcohol-induced injury in the developing liver.

N2  - The present study was carried out to investigate how hormonal changes caused by chronic alcohol exposure of rats during the late period of gestation are coordinated with neuroendocrine functions of the fetal thymus, namely thymic expression of CRH and POMC genes. Alcohol consumption by pregnant dams led to a 5-fold elevation of plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels and significantly decreased fetal CORT levels. This generally inverse correlation between maternal and fetal CORT was absent in alcohol-consuming dams and their male fetuses on day 19 of gestation. These day 19 fetuses also had an attenuated plasma testosterone surge that occurred in the male control (pair-fed) fetus on day 19 of embryonic life. Furthermore, fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) resulted in a significant increase in thymic CRH and a decrease in thymic POMC expression in the male fetuses only, specifically on embryonic day 19. Thus, the strong positive correlation between CRH and POMC gene expression in the thymus of pair-fed male and female FAE fetuses was abolished in the FAE males. However, regardless of embryonic age or treatment, a strong positive correlation between thymic POMC gene expression and plasma testosterone levels in the male fetuses was detected. These data suggest that the sexually dimorphic effect of FAE on the fetal thymic POMC and CRH expression in males is driven by testosterone and may be related, therefore, to the presence of alcohol at the time of the prenatal testosterone surge in the male fetuses.

N2  - Several forms of cell perturbation have been associated with ethanol ingestion. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) as well as diminished maxillofacial development and inhibition of cell regeneration in vitro and in vivo have been described. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates maxillofacial growth, DNA synthesis, and it is a potent mitogen for a number of various cell types. EGF exerts its effects on cells through binding to a specific cell surface receptor which leads to activation of a thyrosine kinase in the intracellular part of the receptor. The inhibitory effect of alcohol on EGF in the mouse dental follicle was studied in the offspring of alcoholic mothers using immunocytochemistry. Adult female mice were given 22% alcohol in their drinking water and fed a pelleted diet before and during pregnancy. Maternal blood alcohol levels were 262 +/- 1.3 mg/100 ml on gestation day 12.5. The offspring of the alcoholic and control mice were sacrificed on postnatal day 1.5, their mandibles were dissected, weighed and processed by routine immunocytochemistry with the following results. 1) Significant differences were found in mandible weight p < 0.01 after parturition. 2) The tooth germs in the offspring of ethanol treated mice were morphometrically smaller than those of control littermates. 3) Immunoexpression of EGF in the mandibular first molar of the control group was strong and homogeneous while in the experimental group the expression was light and heterogeneous. It is concluded that maternal alcoholism reduces EGF in the offspring.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: the nurse practitioner perspective
A1  - Quick S.
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause of mental retardation in the United States. The tragedy is that while FAS is irreversible, it is 100% preventable. FAS is caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol is a teratogen and acts in different ways to produce physical and central nervous system malformations and defects in the developing embryo and fetus. FAS is characterized by a history of maternal alcohol ingestion, central nervous system dysfunction, growth deficiencies, and specific physical anomalies. Adolescents and adults with FAS have behavioral problems that differentiate them from other mentally disabled individuals. Nurse practitioners can have an impact on the prevalence of FAS by educating clients about FAS and its relationship to alcohol consumption. NPs need to carefully identify high-risk women and their partners before a pregnancy occurs and assist with interventions to stop active alcoholism or alcohol use during pregnancy. NPs have the capability to decrease the severity of alcohol's effects during pregnancy through education, counseling, and intervention. NPs have the skills to work with case-finding and early identification of infants and children who display signs and symptoms of FAS. With such case-finding, early identification, and prompt referral to the appropriate diagnostic and/or supportive community agencies, individuals with FAS can receive timely intervention to minimize the effects of FAS. Adults with behavioral problems can be assessed for FAS and referred for appropriate assistance as well. Finally, NPs can facilitate public awareness of FAS through educational efforts with individuals, families, and communities.

N2  - The consequences of fetal alcohol exposure are far-reaching and preventable. Health care providers are uniquely positioned to promote alcohol-free pregnancy, yet an array of factors inhibit routine screening, counseling, and referral. This descriptive, qualitative study explored experiences and perceived barriers related to prenatal screening for alcohol use. The study included eight focus groups (71 participants) and 41 key informant interviews with health care professionals representing a mix of disciplines. Nearly 40% of the providers were physicians who regularly encounter women in their practices. While most providers ask about alcohol use, few probe in depth or follow up. The findings should alert program planners and medical educators to strengthen their preventive medical and public health practices.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with a wide variety of cognitive deficits and behavioral problems. Little is known, however, about the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on visuospatial processing. Alcohol-exposed and normal control children were presented with visual hierarchical stimuli consisting of large (global) letters or shapes constructed from the arrangement of numerous smaller (local) letters or shapes. The children were asked first to recall the global-local stimuli and different single-level stimuli from memory and then to copy them. Alcohol-exposed children were impaired in recalling local features relative to global features. When the alcohol-exposed children attempted to copy the same stimuli, there was also a selective deficit in local but not global reproduction. A control condition indicated that the selective deficit in local processing was not due to a size effect per se. These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure does not result in a unitary visual-spatial impairment, but rather, is manifested as a selective deficit in the visual processing of local (detail) features.

N2  - Nulliparous pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to ethanol via a liquid diet technique (FAE, fetal alcohol exposure) or administered a fixed amount of control diet from gestational day 11 to day 21. The offspring, at 2-3 months of age, were studied in tests of mechanically monitored motor activity and learning acquisition in an automatized testing cage requiring an instrumental discriminative response, where the ability to learn and relearn correlations of a light signal to water presentation was monitored. A significantly reduced activity (i.e. ramp mounting behaviour) in a novel situation was obtained in the FAE group compared to controls. The initial disruption of ramp mounting behaviour could reflect alterations in either habituation to a novel test situation, altered neophobia, or some retardation in associating these responses with the outcome of water-availability. Adult FAE rats (six months of age) showed a tendency towards a lowered acquisition performance (p = 0.06) when tested in a circular Morris-type swim maze, but no detectable differences were shown in a motor activity test chamber situation.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure may cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is associated with pre- and postnatal growth retardation. Materials and methods: Spontaneous 24-h growth hormone (GH) secretion was measured in six prepubertal short children with FAS (two boys and four girls) aged 4-14 years. The response to a GH stimulation test, and levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were also measured. Comparisons were made between the children with FAS and healthy children of both normal and short stature, as well as children born small for gestational age (SGA). Results: There were no differences in the mean area under the curve above the baseline or the maximum level of GH during a 24-h period (GH(max)) between the children with FAS and the reference groups. However, the estimated rate of spontaneous 24-h GH secretion in children with FAS was similar to that of children born SGA, but lower than in children of normal stature (p = 0.02). The plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were in the lower parts of the normal range. Conclusion: We conclude that GH secretion in short children with FAS is similar to that in short children born SGA; that is, in the lower range of normal children.

N2  - Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is a known cause of birth defects associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome, but its role in more common, isolated, craniofacial birth defects is not well understood. A population-based, case-control study of orofacial clefts was conducted in Iowa using births during 1987-1991. Cases were identified by the Iowa Birth Defects Registry and classified as having a cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) or cleft palate only (CP) and whether the cleft was isolated or occurred with other birth defects. Controls were selected from normal Iowa births. Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy was classified according to self-reported drinks consumed per month. Results are based on 302 controls and the following numbers in each case group: 118 isolated CLP, 56 isolated CP, 51 CLP with multiple defects, and 62 CP with multiple defects. Compared to women who did not drink alcohol during pregnancy, the relative odds of isolated CLP rose with increasing level of maternal drinking as follows: 1-3 drinks per months, 1.5; 4-10 drinks per month, 3.1; more than 10 drinks per month, 4.7 (chi-square test for trend, P = 0.003). Adjustment for maternal smoking, vitamin use, education, and household income did not substantially alter these results. No significant association was found between alcohol use and isolated cleft palate or clefts in children with multiple birth defects. Alcohol use during pregnancy may be a cause of isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a variety of cognitive deficits, notably in mathematics and higher order processes such as abstraction. An exploratory battery was developed to examine specific types of number processing impairments in 29 adolescent and adult patients with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) relative to controls matched for age, gender, and educational level. The battery included 11 tests: number reading and writing, exact calculation (addition, multiplication, subtraction), approximate calculation (selecting a plausible result for an operation), number comparison, proximity judgment, and cognitive estimation. The results indicated particular difficulties in calculation and estimation tests, with intact number reading and writing ability. The greatest impairment was found in the cognitive estimation test, which is sensitive to frontal lobe lesions. The patterns of deficit described may reflect either the diffuseness of brain damage incurred from prenatal alcohol exposure, or a cumulative deficit in comprehension which may be important for the acquisition of higher-order mathematical abilities.

T1  - Effects of nerve growth factor on splenic norepinephrine and pineal N-acetyl-transferase in neonate rats exposed to alcohol in utero: Neuroimmune correlates

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (FAE) has been associated with multiple anomalies, including a selective developmental delay of sympathetic innervation in lymphoid organs. Sympathetic neurons require nerve growth factor (NGF) for their development and maintenance, and recent evidence has suggested that alcohol impairs the synthesis and/or biological activity of NGF in selected central and peripheral neurons. Thus, the present study examined the hypothesis that NGF administration to FAE rats during early postnatal development would reverse some of the peripheral sympathetic deficits. Neonate rats, FAE and the corresponding control cohorts, received daily treatments of NGF or cytochrome C (0.3 mg/kg; s.c.) for various time intervals, and were killed 24 hr or 10 days after the last treatment. The measured parameters included norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in the spleen and heart, which receive noradrenergic innervation from the coeliac ganglion and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), respectively. In addition, we measured the activity of pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT), the rate-limiting enzyme of melatonin biosynthesis, which depends on sympathetic innervation from the SCG. The data show that chronic, but not acute, NGF treatments reversed the FAE-related deficits in splenic NE concentrations as well as in pineal NAT activity in a time- and age-dependent manner. Sympathetic neurons play an important role in immune modulation. Thus, the altered splenic NE levels and pineal NAT activity may play a role in immune deficits associated with exposure to alcohol in utero.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Controversy exists whether carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) is valuable as a screening tool for fetal alcohol syndrome. We evaluated serum CDT in 60 non-alcohol-abusing women at different stages of normal pregnancy. CDT was weakly related to week of pregnancy and to human placental lactogen. CDT did not correlate with iron, oestradiol or progesterone. By contrast, good correlations were found between transferrin and week of pregnancy or either sex hormone. Using multiple linear regression analysis, only transferrin and week of pregnancy were important predictors of CDT. The diagnostic accuracy of CDT for detecting alcohol abuse may be limited in pregnant women and should be carefully assessed in relation to alcohol consumption.

T1  - Gender differences in the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to immune signals
A1  - Lee S.
A1  - Rivier C.
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Immature (3 week old) rat offspring of alcohol (E)-fed dams show a blunted ACTH response to immune signals such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and endotoxin (LPS). In contrast, mature offspring respond to physical stresses with an exaggerated activation of their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The present work was aimed at determining if there was a differential influence of prenatal E exposure on the HPA axis responses to various stressors or if, alternatively, sexual maturation modified these responses. When administered IL-1beta at 5 weeks age, E-treated intact male offspring released less ACTH, compared to control (C) or pair-fed (PF) animals. However, they showed an augmented response to LPS and a local inflammatory process induced by turpentine injection. At this same age, intact E females secreted significantly more ACTH in response to IL-1beta, LPS and turpentine, than C or PF offspring. By 9 weeks of age, both E males and E females exhibited larger (p<.05) ACTH responses to all three immune stimuli. In order to determine whether sex steroids modulate the influence of E in females, ovariectomy was done prior to puberty. This treatment decreased the difference in the ACTH released by E and C rats in response to IL-1beta, LPS and turpentine. These results show that while immature rats exposed to E prenatally released less ACTH in response to cytokines than C or PF animals did, this response was qualitatively reversed after puberty. At that time, the larger amounts of ACTH secreted by E offspring, compared to the other groups, were reminiscent of the hyperactive response of the HPA axis when these offspring were exposed to physical stress. Interestingly, removal of circulating ovarian steroids prevented the influence of E from being exerted. This suggests the presence of a functional relationship between the pathways influenced by prenatal E and those influenced by female sex steroids, that are important in regulating the activity of the HPA axis.

N2  - This is s report on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the academic achievement of children at 6 years of age. In this longitudinal study, women were interviewed at the end of each trimester of pregnancy, at delivery, and at 8, 18, 36, and 72 months postpartum. The women were of lower socioeconomic status, high school-educated, and moderate users of alcohol. The offspring received age-appropriate physical and developmental assessments at each follow-up. Linear regression and nonlinear curve fitting were used to investigate the nature end shape of the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and achievement. In addition, the role of child IQ in this relationship was explored. Alcohol exposure during the second trimester predicted deficits in each of the three subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R): reading, spelling, and arithmetic. The relationship was partially reduced by the addition of IQ to the model, but prenatal alcohol exposure still predicted significant deficits in achievement, even after controlling for IQ. Tests for the shape of the relationship demonstrated that the effect of prenatal exposure on the arithmetic subtest of the WRAT-R was a linear or dose-response relationship. By contrast, the relationships between prenatal alcohol exposure and performance on the spelling and reading subtests of the WRAT-R were better modeled as threshold effects. The thresholds for both were ~1 drink/day in the second trimester.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome - An ophthalmological and socioeducational prospective study
A1  - Stromland K.
A1  - Hellstrom A.
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Background. The eye is a sensitive indicator of adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Anomalies of the eyes and their adnexa are known to be associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), although long-term effects of these malformations are unknown. Design. A prospective ophthalmologic follow-up (median, 11 years; range, 4 to 19 years) was performed in 25 children with FAS. Their social situation and educational status were also investigated. Results. All but one of the children had ophthalmologic abnormalities. Fundus anomalies were observed in 23 children, of whom 19 had optic nerve hypoplasia. Thirteen children had concomitant strabismus. Microphthalmos, buphthalmos, phthisis, microcornea, coloboma of the iris and uvea, blepharoptosis, cataract, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, and nystagmus were observed in single cases. The dysmorphology of the eyes remained unchanged during the follow-up period. In 2 children with severe mental retardation and, initially, very poor vision, the severe visual handicap persisted. Seventeen children had an initial visual acuity >20/70, which remained unchanged in 10 children and improved in 7 children, despite the presence of optic nerve hypoplasia in 14 of the children. Ten mothers died, 8 of them because of alcohol-related diseases, and only 4 of the mothers were able to take care of their children. Sixteen children went to schools for the mentally retarded, and only 3 children had a normal school education without extra teaching assistance. Conclusions. In children with FAS, the major sequela, ie, brain damage, remains despite extensive medical, educational, and social support. The presence of ophthalmic signs, which persisted but did not deteriorate during the follow-up period, strengthens the diagnosis of FAS, and the high frequency of ocular involvement indicates the importance of a complete ophthalmologic evaluation in children with FAS.

N2  - Gross motor development of preschool children prenatally exposed to alcohol and marijuana was assessed as part of a longitudinal study. Most mothers in the study were light to moderate users and discontinued or decreased use of alcohol and marijuana after the first trimester of pregnancy. The women were of lower socioeconomic status, half of the sample was African-American, and most were single. Gross motor development was evaluated with balance and ball-handling items at 3 years. Balance Items included walking on a line, walking on a balance beam, standing on one foot, standing on tiptoes, and stair climbing and descent. Ball-handling items included catching, throwing, and kicking a ball. Refusal to perform items was also recorded. Prenatal alcohol and marijuana exposure did not negatively affect gross motor development. The composite score on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, age at assessment, gender, and examiner were significant predictors of gross motor performance and of refusal to participate in the balance items. The ponderal index, number of siblings, current income, examiner, current maternal use of tranquilizers, and first trimester exposure to amphetamines were also significant predictors of balance skills. Gender and number of hospitalizations predicted refusal to participate in balance items, whereas hearing and vision problems predicted refusal on ball-handling items. The components of timing, speed, and fine motor control have not been addressed in this study, and therefore it is premature to conclude that there is no impact of prenatal substance use on motor development.

N2  - The risk of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is known to increase with increased maternal age and parity. This study investigated the hypothesis that the deficits in growth and intellectual function seen in non-FAS infants exposed to alcohol at moderate-to-heavy levels are also found disproportionately in the offspring of older mothers. Mothers of 480 African- American, inner-city infants were interviewed at each prenatal clinic visit regarding their use of alcohol during pregnancy. Infants were assessed for physical growth and cognitive development repeatedly through age 13 months. In analyses run separately for the infants of younger and older mothers, alcohol-related deficits were seen most strongly in the offspring of women over 30 years of age. This pattern was not caused by lower levels of drinking by the younger mothers. Age-related increases in maternal body fat-to-water ratio and a faster rate of alcohol metabolism in chronic drinking women may account for the greater vulnerability of the offspring of the older mothers. These data suggest that physiological changes associated with aging and/or chronic drinking may play an important role in the alcohol-related birth defects seen in infants exposed at moderate-to-heavy levels.

N2  - The effects of environmental enrichment on synaptic spine density in hippocampal area CA1 were examined in rats exposed prenatally to alcohol. Pregnant dams were given ethanol via intragastric intubation (6 g/kg/day) from gestational days 8 through 19, or given isocaloric sucrose. An untreated control group was also used. After weaning, offspring from the three groups were then reared for 10 weeks in either isolated (caged alone, not handled) or enriched (group housed with 'toys,' handled) conditions. Animals were then sacrificed, the brains Golgi impregnated, and CA1 pyramidal cell apical and basilar spine densities quantified. Among isolated animals there were no significant differences between control and alcohol-exposed groups. In general, environmental enrichment increased apical or basilar spine densities in untreated and sucrose controls. However, in prenatal alcohol-exposed animals, environmental enrichment did not increase spine densities. Because the environmental enrichment acted postnatally, these findings suggest that the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure include decreased neural plasticity enduring into early adulthood. Such a reduction in neuroanatomical plasticity in hippocampus may be associated with cognitive impairments found following prenatal alcohol exposure.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Long Evans male and female rats were exposed to alcohol or control conditions during the early postnatal period, and their maternal behavior was assessed between 25 and 29 days of age. Maternal behavior was induced by exposing experimental animals to pups, and behaviors included retrieval of pups and proximity to pups. After 5 days of continuous exposure to pups, experimental animals were decapitated, and trunk blood was measured for levels of estradiol and progesterone. Alcohol-exposed animals showed a deficit in maternal behavior as measured by a longer latency to retrieve pups than rats that were not treated with alcohol. In addition, alcohol-exposed animals had lower levels of circulating estradiol than controls. These effects may also be explained by undernutrition as a result of artificial rearing. No difference in progesterone levels was found. As estradiol is important for the onset of maternal behavior in adult rats, it may be that the alcohol-induced decrease in estradiol levels underlies the deficit in maternal behavior exhibited by alcohol-exposed rats.

T1  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on birth weight in rats: Is there an inverted U-shaped function?
A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Decreases in birth weight are among the most commonly reported effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. However, these decreases are typically associated with relatively high doses of alcohol. Two studies were conducted. The first evaluated the effects of low doses of alcohol (0.15 and 0.30 g/kg) on birth weight and other measures. A second study examined the effects of a relatively high dose of alcohol (3.0 g/kg). The two low doses of alcohol produced a slight, but not significant, increase in birth weight relative to vehicle controls whereas the high dose of alcohol produced a significant decrease in birth weight relative to its controls. When the data for the two studies were combined, the relationship between alcohol and birth weight assumed an inverted U-shaped function. There was no effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on weights at weaning, passive avoidance learning, or ambulation. In the context of birth weight, slight increases may be related to increased protein synthesis associated with low doses of alcohol.

A1  - Gilliam D.M.
A1  - Kotch L.E.
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Genetically based alcohol sensitivity may influence the severity of alcohol-related birth defects. To examine this question, measures of growth and survival were examined in offspring of the alcohol sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) and alcohol-resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mouse lines following prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant LS and SS mice received an ethanol dose of either 6 or 8 g/kg/day from days 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Control groups received a maltose-dextrin solution made isocaloric to the 8 g/kg/day dose. Ethanol and maltose-dextrin solutions were administered as split doses, 6 h apart, via gavage. Nonintubated lab chow control groups were also included for both mouse lines. Offspring were fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred stock. Pregnancy was longer for ethanol-treated LS dams compared to maltose dextrin and lab chow LS control groups, whereas pregnancy length for ethanol- treated SS dams was similar to SS controls. Prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in dose-related growth deficits in LS but not in SS litters. Line differences in postnatal growth deficits in response to prenatal alcohol exposure suggest maternal or fetal alcohol sensitivity influence alcohol- related birth defects.

N2  - Objective: To determine the knowledge, clinical experience and perceived needs for resource materials of Saskatchewan physicians in regard to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related birth defects. Design: Mailed survey. Setting: Saskatchewan. Participants: All 48 pediatricians and half (394) of the family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) practising in Saskatchewan received a questionnaire. The numbers of physicians who completed it were 24 and 249 respectively. Results: The pediatricians were more likely than the other physicians to be aware of FAS and to have diagnosed at least one case of FAS. Among the FPs and GPs, the year of graduation from medical school was a significant factor in their knowledge of FAS and their diagnostic practices. Those who graduated before 1974, the year FAS was first described in the medical literature, were less likely than the more recent graduates to be aware of FAS and to ask their patients about alcohol use during pregnancy but were more likely to feel comfortable discussing alcohol-related issues in families. All of the groups reported a need for more information about FAS and for resources on alcohol-related issues in general. Conclusions: Saskatchewan physicians are aware of FAS but have expressed a need for more information about FAS, particularly for parents, as well as physician training materials and information about where to refer patients with FAS and parents with alcohol-related problems.

T1  - The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in New Zealand

A1  - Marks R.E.
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - AIMS. To obtain an estimate of the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in New Zealand and to report information on paediatrician surveillance for alcohol related birth defects. METHODS. New Zealand paediatricians were asked to complete a postal survey. Questions recorded the number of children with alcohol related birth defects under their care, and examined the respondents' surveillance for alcohol related birth defects. RESULTS. There were 63 children under 10 years of age with fetal alcohol syndrome under paediatric care in 1993. The majority of paediatricians considered the diagnosis only when risk features were identified: the most frequent being children of high risk mothers and children with dysmorphic features. CONCLUSIONS. Fetal alcohol syndrome exists in New Zealand. The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome as estimated in this study is lower than would be expected from international prevalence reports and is likely to be an underestimate. Current surveillance for alcohol related birth defects depends on an individual paediatrician considering the diagnosis only when faced with a perceived at risk infant or child, and there is likely under recognition. An increased awareness of the risks of alcohol consumption in pregnancy and the full spectrum of alcohol related birth defects is required.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and pineal response to isoproterenol, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and desmethylimipramine
A1  - Yuwiler A.
A1  - Taylor A.N.
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Pineals from neonatal rats born to alcohol-fed mothers had lower unstimulated serotonin-N-acetyltransferase activity (NAT) and responded less to isoproterenol, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, or desmethylimipramine challenge than did pineals from pups born to normal or pair-fed mothers. Group differences disappeared after the first week of life. Reduced NAT activity is coincident with elevated glucocorticoids in these pups. In contrast to these effects of chronic in utero ethanol exposure, acute ethanol addition to normal adult pineals in organ culture enhanced ISO but not VIP stimulation of NAT activity. The results suggest that the neonatal pineal is more affected by ethanol-induced activation of the adrenocortical axis during gestation than by the direct effect of ethanol on membrane fluidity.

T1  - Use of international classification of diseases coding to identify fetal alcohol syndrome--Indian Health Service facilities, 1981-1992
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States (1). Since 1979, surveillance systems for estimating and tracking FAS have categorized cases using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71 (2). This code comprises noxious influences affecting the fetus or newborn through placenta or breast milk, specifically alcohol, and includes FAS. Because the code is not specific for FAS and may reflect maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy or other adverse effects of alcohol on the fetus, CDC assessed the usefulness of this code in ascertaining FAS cases by reviewing medical records for 1981-1993 from the Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service (IHS) and IHS contract facilities in eight of the 19 tribal or American Indian communities in the area. This report summarizes the findings of the analysis.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) refers to a pattern of birth defects occurring in a subpopulation of children born to women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. The significant medical, social, and economic impact of FAS is increasing. Particularly hard-hit are African-American and native-American women and children. Over the past two decades, basic and clinical research produced voluminous data on ethanol effects on developing organisms. In 1991, Duester and Pullarkat proposed that competition of ethanol with retinol at the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) binding site formed the basis of the FAS mechanism. This competition adversely affects the developing fetus caused by deregulation of retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis essential for proper fetal tissue development. Stated concisely, the FAS hypothesis is: 1. Class I ADH catalyzes the rate-limiting step in oxidation of retinol (ROH) to RA, and ethanol (ETOH) to acetic acid, thus establishing competition for AOH between ROH and ETOH. 2. RA is required as a signal molecule for cell differentiation critical for normal fetal morphogenisis. 3. ADH hinds ingested ETOH, thus deregulating RA homeostasis leading to improper RA signal transduction. Preliminary results from molecular modeling studies of ROH-ADH and ETOH-ADH structures, and physiologic pharmacokinetic modeling confirm the hypothesis with remarkable fidelity.

N2  - Objectives. This study investigated the effect of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on psychomotor development of preschool-age children in a longitudinal study. Methods. Pregnant women were interviewed about their alcohol consumption at their first visit to the maternity hospital in Roubaix, France. Alcohol consumption before pregnancy and during the first trimester was assessed with a structured questionnaire. The psychomotor development of 155 children of these women was assessed with the McCarthy scales of children's abilities when the children were about 4 1/2 years old. Results. Consumption of 1.5 oz of absolute alcohol (approximately three drinks) or more per day during pregnancy was significantly related to a decrease of 7 points in the mean score on the general cognitive index of the McCarthy scales, after gender, birth order, maternal education, score for family stimulation, family status, maternal employment, child's age at examination, and examiner were controlled for. Conclusions. This study showed that moderate to heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy, at levels well below those associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, has effects on children's psychomotor development.

T1  - Is moderate alcohol intake in pregnancy associated with the craniofacial features related to the fetal alcohol syndrome?

N2  - Social drinking in pregnancy is common in many countries despite the fact that alcohol in high doses has teratogenic properties. The public health implications would be appreciable if even moderate alcohol consumption were associated with embryonal or fetal maldevelopment. A presumably sensitive marker of an alcohol effect was used in this study, namely the fetal craniofacial features included in the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The study was based upon self-reported alcohol intake and photographs taken at birth or at 18 months of children born to mothers with a low or moderate alcohol intake during pregnancy. These women were selected during pregnancy by a two-stage sampling from all in well defined regions. Data were available concerning 323 pregnant women and some 200 to 220 children. A short palpebral fissure, a short nose to upper-lip distance and a broad root of the nose were expected to be associated with alcohol intake in early pregnancy, but such an association was only seen between binge drinking and a short palpebral fissure. No associations proved statistically significant at the 18-month examination and any association could merely be secondary to the known association between alcohol and birth weight.

N2  - For 20 years, it has been known that fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with abnormal brain development. Early autopsy studies point to the corpus callosum as one area affected by heavy alcohol exposure. Little is known, however, about the integrity of the brain in alcohol-exposed children who survive the perinatal period. This study was designed to assess the corpus callosum in living children exposed to high doses of alcohol prenatally. Thirteen children with histories of significant prenatal alcohol exposure and 12 normal control children were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. Using the midsagittal section, images were measured for the area of the corpus callosum using a computer-assisted measurement technique. In addition to the overall area, five equiangular regions were determined for each corpus callosum. Of the 13 alcohol-exposed children assessed, two had agenesis of the corpus callosum. The remaining alcohol- exposed children had significantly smaller overall callosal areas, as well as smaller regional areas of four of the five callosal regions, when compared with the normal control children. Importantly, when corrected for brain size, three of the five callosal regions were still smaller in the alcohol-exposed children, although overall area of the corpus callosum was no longer significantly different. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol is associated with abnormalities of the corpus callosum. They verify callosal agenesis in children with FAS, which previously had only been noted in autopsy reports. The current findings further document selective reductions in the area of certain regions of the corpus callosum after in utero alcohol exposure, extending our current understanding of alcohol's teratogenic effects on brain development. There is also some indication that the selective reduction in the area of the corpus callosum is similar to that reported in attention deficit disorder.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol-related birth defects are the result of heavy maternal alcohol consumption during gestation. The magnitude of deficit manifested by the offspring is invariably a consequence of several risk factors that may result in high peak blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), such as the duration, timing, or pattern of alcohol consumption. In addition, the alcohol content of the consumed beverage may play a role in determining offspring developmental consequences. Because higher BACs are positively correlated with risk and severity of brain injury early in postnatal life, initially it was important to determine how BAC is influenced by alcohol concentration and whether that influence is constant over repeated alcohol treatments. Groups of female Sprague-Dawley rate received daily intragastric intubations of 5 g/kg alcohol in one of several concentrations: 45% (v/v), 30% (v/v), 22.5% (v/v), or 15% (v/v) for a duration of 18 consecutive days. Blood samples were taken at various times postintubation on days 3, 8, 13, and 18 of treatment, and analyzed by headspace gas chromatography. Multivariate analyses of peak BAC, average BAC, and time to reach peak BAC revealed some noteworthy results. First, peak BAC and average BAC were significantly lower in the 45% group, compared with the other concentration groups, whereas this group also took a longer time to reach peak BAC than the other three groups. Second, peak BAC and average BAC were higher on the last day of treatment than any of the other treatment days. These results suggest that alcohol concentration and repeated alcohol exposure can influence BAC and, as such, are important risk factors to be considered in the appraisal of alcohol-induced fatal brain injuries.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with a cluster of symptoms called Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with a characteristic pattern of neuroanatomy and biochemical changes. In recent years it has been shown, that stress exposed cells rapidly increase transcription and translation of heat shock protein genes resulting in an increased appearance of these proteins. It has also been found that heat shock proteins, especially the HSP70 family play a role as molecular chaperons maintaining the native conformation of proteins and participating in protein transport in particular cellular compartments. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chronic maternal alcohol consumption on HSP70 content in the different regions of the brain of the newborn rats as well as to examine in vitro the effect of ethanol on HSP70 content in cultured glial cells. Chronic maternal ethanol consumption resulted in increased HSP70 in the following regions of developing brain: hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory bulbs, frontal cortex and septum. Moreover, ethanol applied in vitro, increased HSP70 content in primary astroglial cultures and astrocytes but not in oligodendrocyte cultures. The above described changes may be important in brain maturation and may play a role in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Morphological development of the rat oculomotor nucleus was investigated on postnatal day 15 following a prenatal ethanol exposure. Analysis of toluidine blue stained plastic sections showed that the prenatal alcohol exposure caused a decrease in the density of neurons and an increase in the density of astrocytes in the center of the nucleus. There was an alcohol-induced reduction in the overall size of the cross-sectional region of the oculomotor nucleus, but no effect on the number of neurons per unit area of that total oculomotor region, indicating a delay or alteration of the migration of neurons to their normal clustered position in the center of the nucleus. The areas of the neuronal cell nucleus and nucleolus were not affected by the alcohol exposure. Analysis of Golgi-Cox-impregnated multipolar neurons showed that the alcohol exposure caused a reduction in area of the cell soma; a reduction in the number of dendritic branches; and a reduction in the complexity of the dendritic arbor relative to distance from the soma, based on concentric ring analysis. The results of this study demonstrate that gestational alcohol exposure can retard the maturation of the oculomotor nucleus.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - We present an hypothesis integrating epidemiological, clinical case, and basic biomedical research to explain why only relatively few women who drink alcohol during pregnancy give birth to children with alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), in particular, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). We argue that specific sociobehavioral risk factors, e.g., low socioeconomic status, are permissive for FAS in that they provide the context for increased vulnerability. We illustrate how these permissive factors are related to biological factors, e.g., decreased antioxidant status, which in conjunction with alcohol, provoke FAS/ARBDs in vulnerable fetuses. We propose an integrative heuristic model hypothesizing that these permissive and provocative factors increase the likelihood of FAS/ARBDs because they potentiate two related mechanisms of alcohol-induced teratogenesis, specifically, maternal/fetal hypoxia and free radical formation.

N2  - Although insulin is known to be an important generator of regulatory signals during fetal growth and development, neither the immediate nor long- term effects of alcohol (ethanol) on insulin action are well understood. In the rat, fetal exposure to alcohol has been shown to be correlated with a subsequent abnormal response to a glucose load in the neonate and adult. Further, fetal hypoplasia secondary to maternal alcohol consumption is correlated with decreased placental glucose transport and with a lowering of the glucose levels in fetal tissues. However, the fetal effects of alcohol cannot be completely overcome by glucose/caloric supplementation, suggesting that factors other than glucose transport are involved. Using an embryonic chick model that negates the factors of maternal/placental metabolism and transport, the current study found that fetal alcohol exposure markedly increased insulin binding in developing tissue, but had little effect on the binding of the insulin-like growth factors. Competitive binding experiments revealed a marked increase in insulin receptor numbers, but no change in binding affinity as a result of the alcohol exposure. Basal uptake of 2- deoxyglucose by fetal tissue was lowered by alcohol exposure, but incubation with exogenous porcine insulin (1 x 10-7 M) resulted in a significant increase in glucose uptake by the alcohol-exposed embryos. The increases in insulin binding and in insulin-dependent glucose uptake notwithstanding, exogenous insulin could not induce normal levels of ornithine decarboxylase activity in embryonic cells previously exposed to alcohol. Furthermore, insulin treatment seemed to inhibit growth in alcohol-exposed whole embryos. Molecular changes in the insulin signaling cascade occurring as the result of alcohol exposure included an increase in specific phosphotyrosine content that was markedly decreased following insulin stimulation. The decrease in phosphotyrosine content did not seem to involve the insulin receptor substrate-1:phosphoinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase complex, because alcohol-treated embryos had significantly elevated basal PI-3 kinase activity that was not altered by insulin exposure. In summary, alcohol-induced growth suppression in the chick embryo is associated with several changes in insulin signaling and thus data suggest that this important mitogenic pathway is impaired as the result of fetal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Differential behavioral effects of the neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone on neonatal rats prenatally exposed to alcohol
A1  - Zinimerberg B.
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the behavioral response to the neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) were investigated in neonatal rats. Two behaviors were assessed: retention of an odor conditioning task and production of ultrasonic vocalizations after brief maternal separation. Subjects from one of the three prenatal conditions (lab chow, alcohol, or pair-fed) received either no injection or an ICV injection of vehicle or one of three doses (1.25-5.0 mug) of allopregnanolone either 20 min prior to or immediately after training in an appetitive odor association paradigm. Retention was assessed 1 h later in a two-choice odor preference chamber. Posttraining injections of allopregnanolone caused a dose-dependent impairment in retention in the odor task, but there was no differential sensitivity to allopregnanolone in the alcohol-exposed offspring. All pretraining injections, including the vehicle, resulted in impairments in retention on the task, suggesting an impairment due to stress but not due to allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone also reduced ultrasonic vocalizations after brief maternal separation in all subjects in a second experiment, but alcohol-exposed offspring displayed a dose-dependent shift to the right in their anxiolytic response to this neurosteroid. This decreased sensitivity suggests that prenatal alcohol exposure may cause a decrease in the density or affinity of the GABA receptors involved in stress response, but not cognitive processes, at this age.

N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse is known to produce retardation in brain maturation and brain functions. Using cultured glial cells as a model system to study these effects of alcohol we found an alcohol antagonizing property for manganese (Mn). Mn was added to the alcohol diet (MnCl2 25 mg/l of 20% v/v ethanol) of pregnant rats. Glial cells were cultured during 4 weeks from cortical brain cells of pups born to these mothers. Several biochemical parameters were examined: protein levels, enzymatic markers of glial cell maturation (enolase and glutamine synthetase), superoxide dismutase a scavenger of free radicals produced during alcohol degradation. The results were compared to appropriate controls. A beneficent effect of Mn was observed for the pups weight which was no more significantly different from the control values. Protein levels, enolase and glutamine synthetase activities were increased mainly during the proliferative period when Mn was added to the alcohol diet compared to the only alcohol treated animals. This Mn effect was not found for superoxide dismutase in cultured glial cells but exists in the total brain of the 2 week-old offspring. In the total 2 and 4 week-old brain the alcohol induced decrease of enolase and glutamine synthetase was also antagonized by the Mn supplementation. Our data suggest that Mn may act as a factor overcoming at least partially some aspects of alcohol induced retardation of nerve cell development.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome, a syndrome which included growth retardation, mental retardation, and dysmorphic facial features, has been observed only among children of alcoholic mothers, who drank alcohol during pregnancy. But it is now established that consuming about 2 or 3 alcoholic drinks per day during pregnancy can induce permanent damage of the central nervous system, with various functional deficits and delayed mental development. The seriousness of the damage seems to be related to the duration of exposure during pregnancy. Occasional heavy consumptions ('binge' drinking) seem to produce similar effects.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure selectively suppresses cell-mediated but not humoral immune responsiveness

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - The present study examined effects of fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) on the ability of peripubertal male and female rats to mount a humoral immune response against T-cell-dependent as well as independent antigens. The appropriate pair-fed (PF) and control (C) cohort rats were included. Serum immunoglobulins (Ig) levels were determined following a primary or secondary immune response. In addition, plasma corticosterone levels were measured in conscious, freely moving FAE, PF and C rats following sensitization with the T-cell-dependent antigen sheep red blood cells (SRBC). The study demonstrates that, in response to primary or secondary immunization, serum Ig levels in FAE rats were not significantly different from those in the PF or C cohorts. On the other hand, a marked reduction in mitogen-induced T-cell proliferative response was observed in FAE male rats in the same age group. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were increased almost four-fold 7 days after the primary immunization with SRBC, but there were no significant differences among the FAE, PF or C groups. Taken together, evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies indicates that FAE is associated with a selective impairment of cell-mediated immune function, including mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation, graft versus host as well as contact sensitization responses, but not of humoral immune function.

N2  - Optic nerve hypoplasia is commonly observed in children affected by the fetal alcohol syndrome, and is believed to contribute to their poor visual acuity. We have used a 'binge' model of alcohol abuse in an attempt to recreate this hypoplasia in a mouse model. Pregnant female (C57BL/6 x CBA)F1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of a 25% solution of ethanol (v:w), either on d 11 or d 12 of gestation. Optic nerves were prepared for transmission electron microscopy from offspring at 3, 6, 9 and 15 wk of age (n = 64). A systematic random sampling technique was used to analyse both the cross-sectional areas of the optic nerves from semithin sections, and the numbers and cross-sectional areas of myelinated axons from thin sections. We found no significant differences either in the cross-sectional area or in the number of axons in the optic nerves between 3 and 9 wk from control and alcohol-treated groups. From 9 to 15 wk, alcohol-treated groups showed a loss of approximately 25% of myelinated axons (65931 +/- 2806-49186 +/- 3194: mean number of axons +/- S.E.M., respectively). Over the same period the number of axons in control groups was relatively stable (62087 +/- 2043-64703 +/- 3607). This resulted in an optic nerve with statistically significantly fewer myelinated axons at 15 wk in the alcohol-treated group, and was reflected in a trend towards a smaller cross-sectional area of the optic nerve in alcohol-treated groups. Analysis of axon calibre distribution within the optic nerves suggested that axons of all sizes were lost between 9 and 15 wk in the alcohol-treated groups. We suggest a delayed trophic mechanism for this late axon loss, and that the term optic nerve atrophy may be a more accurate description of the process.

N2  - Previous studies have shown that prenatal ethanol exposure can partially masculinize or defeminize neurobehavioral development of female rats. An early age of onset of anovulation is one of the primary characteristics of partial defeminization. Consequently, we examined the occurrence of anovulation in fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) female rats at 2, 6, and 12 months of age using both vaginal cytology as well as wheel-running behavior. We assessed the ability of estrogen and progesterone to elicit proprioceptive behaviors and lordosis at 2 and 17 months of age. Female subjects were derived from Sprague-Dawley dams administered an ethanol liquid diet (35% ethanol-derived calories), a pair-fed isocaloric liquid diet, or fed lab chow from days 14 to 22 of gestation. Litter representatives were placed in a computer-monitored wheel-running apparatus under a 12-hr lighting schedule from 49 to 60 days of age. Vaginal smears were taken from littermates during this same period. This same procedure was conducted again from 180 to 196 and from 380 to 396 days of age, except that vaginal cytology was examined in the same animals immediately after wheel-running behavior was studied. At ~2 months of age, a normal cyclical pattern of wheel-running, characteristic of 4- to 5-day estrus cycles, was observed in all animals. No differences were detected in mean activity levels during the wheel-running period. This was accompanied by normal cyclic vaginal cytology and normal proprioceptive behaviors and lordosis. At 6 months of age, FAE females exhibited significantly reduced wheel-running. This was associated with a loss in the cyclical increase in wheel-running in 8 of 16 FAE females compared with 1 of 15 controls. Vaginal cytology confirmed the significant increase in the number of acyclic FAE females compared with controls at this age in these same animals. At 12-13 months of age, wheel-running activity was significantly reduced in all treatment groups compared with earlier ages, with no differences observed between groups. This was accompanied by a loss of cyclicity in 50-70% of controls and 100% of FAE animals. At 17 months of age, proprioceptive behavior and the lordosis quotient in FAE females was not different from that observed in controls. However, the quality of the lordotic response was found to ha significantly less in FAE females. Overall, these results indicate that the window of reproductive competence in females may be shortened by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Glutamate receptors play important roles during brain development. We have investigated the effect of chronic maternal alcohol intake on the ontogenic profile of hippocampal glutamate receptor subtypes in their offspring. Binding of 3H-MK-801 to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor was measured in isolated membranes from the hippocampus of the offspring of pair-fed control and alcohol-fed rats at different times during the postnatal life. Phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis was also assayed to provide a measure of the possible effect of ethanol on the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). In pair-fed control rats, at postnatal day (PND) 3, the 3H-MK-801 binding represents 60% of adult values. Binding then rises to 170% at PND 11, and gradually decreases to adult levels. A transient overshoot in the mGluR-coupled PIP2 hydrolysis was also observed during postnatal development in rat hippocampus. Alcohol-exposed rats showed a similar pattern, but a significant decrease in the specific binding for NMDA receptor was observed on all the postnatal days analyzed. In addition, alcohol exposure significantly decreases the number of specific 3H-MK-801 binding sites, with no change in the affinity of the site for 3H-MK-801. Moreover, this treatment enhanced the mGluR-activated PIP2 hydrolysis in hippocampus of alcohol-exposed rats. These results may contribute to an understanding of the toxic effects of ethanol on the developing central nervous system (CNS) and help explain the cognitive deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure delays the development of thermoregulation in newborn rats. Newborns generate heat by the sympathetic nervous system's activation of nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In this study, the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the development of the beta-adrenergic receptor system of BAT was investigated by assessing the number and pharmacological properties of beta-adrenergic receptors in BAT in 1- , 5-, 10-, and 20-day-old offspring. Pregnant dams were given either a liquid diet with 35% of the calories derived from alcohol, a liquid diet without alcohol to control for any effects of the liquid diet administration, or ad lib food and water. Offspring from the alcohol prenatal treatment group had a greater number of beta1 adrenergic receptors compared to offspring from both from the pair-fed and lab chow control groups, which did not differ from each other. The greater number of receptor sites in 5-day-old subjects suggests that the number of binding sites in alcohol-exposed BAT cells continues to rise due to the absence of sufficient neurotransmitter, and perhaps reflects a delay in the arrival of sympathetic nervous system neurons. During the second and third postnatal weeks, when NE concentrations are rising and reaching asymptotic levels, the number of beta1 adrenergic receptors in BAT of control subjects is decreasing. This expected compensatory 'downregulation' response in receptor concentration was not seen in BAT from subjects exposed to alcohol prenatally. These findings may have important implications for understanding the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on developing plasticity in the peripheral nervous system.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Capture-recapture methods were used to estimate the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among Alaska Natives born during the period 1982-1989. Potential cases were identified through an Indian Health Service (IHS) patient case file, a pediatric practice case file, and Medicaid claims from private physicians. A total of 74 Alaska Native children aged 3-10 years were identified with a notation of fetal alcohol syndrome by a physician in a medical record. Because not all of these cases had supporting documentation regarding the syndrome, they were classified as possible cases. Of these possible cases, 50 met all five criteria for chart verification of the syndrome: physician notation of fetal alcohol syndrome, growth deficiency, facial features of the syndrome, central nervous system impairment, and a maternal history of alcohol abuse. These data provided observed prevalence rates of chart-verified fetal alcohol syndrome of 3.1 per 1,000 live births for children born 1982-1985 (age 7-10 years), and 2.0 per 1,000 live births for children born 1986-1989 (age 3-6 years). Capture-recapture analyses were conducted using cases identified by IHS and private physicians. These analyses estimated a prevalence of the syndrome of 3.8 per 1,000 live births for children born 1982-1985, and 3.1 per 1,000 live births for children born 1986-1989. Based on the capture-recapture predicted number of cases, the IHS case file ascertained a greater percentage of cases among the older cohort (75%) than among the younger cohort (56%). These data illustrate the use of capture-recapture analyses in identifying the extent to which observed trends in rates may reflect differences in case ascertainment over time (or by birth cohort). The application of capture-recapture in fetal alcohol syndrome surveillance, however, requires careful attention to the underlying assumptions of capture-recapture methods.

N2  - Previous research indicates that the offspring of dams exposed to stress during late gestation show altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses to stress. However, the results are inconsistent and a review of the literature suggests that the effects may differ depending upon the gender of the offspring. In the present study, we measured plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone (B) levels prior to, and at 0, 20, 40 and 70 min following restraint stress in catheterized adult male and female offspring of dams stressed in the last week of gestation (i.e. days 15-19 of gestation). Prenatal stress significantly increased both plasma ACTH and B levels in response to restraint, but only in females; male offspring were largely unaffected. In addition, plasma corticosteroid-binding grobulin (CBG) levels were significantly increased in prenatally-stressed females, but not in males. Despite these differences in plasma CBG, estimated free B levels following restraint were also significantly elevated in prenatally-stressed females. We then examined glucocorticoid receptor binding in a variety of forebrain structures. Prenatal stress had no effect on glucocorticoid receptor density in the hypothalamus or hippocampus in either males or females. Differences in glucocorticoid receptor density across groupswere observed in the septum, frontal cortex, and amygdala. However, the pattern of observed differences across the groups was not consistent with the pattern of hormonal differences. In summary, the effect of prenatal stress on HPA function is substantially more marked in females than in males. Interestingly, a similar pattern of effects on HPA activity has been reported for prenatal alcohol exposure.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Objective. Alcohol has been shown to have teratogenic effects on the fetal central nervous system. However, little research has been done to assess the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on premature infants, a group particularly vulnerable to perinatal brain injury. Methods. We examined the relation between maternal alcohol use and the most common forms of brain injury in premature infants-germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage (GM/IVH) and white-matter damage-in a large population-based cohort of infants weighing 2000 g or less. The analyses included 349 infants younger than 31 weeks' gestation who received at least one cranial ultrasound scan and whose mothers were queried about prenatal alcohol use in a postpartum interview. Results. Infants of mothers who reported 'moderate' alcohol use (fewer than seven drinks per week and fewer than three drinks per occasion) to 'high' use (seven or more drinks per week and/or three or more drinks per occasion) before recognized pregnancy, and moderate alcohol use during pregnancy, were not at increased risk for brain injury. However, after controlling for potentially confounding factors, infants of women reporting high alcohol use during pregnancy were at increased risk of developing isolated brain hemorrhage (odds ratio [OR] = 5.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2, 24.7), any brain hemorrhage (OR = 6.7, 95% CI = 1.8, 26.4), and white-matter damage (OR = 9.5, 95% CI = 1.9, 46.4). Conclusion. Premature infants of women who report consuming seven or more drinks per week and/or three or more drinks per occasion during pregnancy have substantially elevated risks of both of the most common forms of brain injury in premature infants.

T1  - Frequent alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age--Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1991
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome and other congenital anomalies. Substantial prenatal alcohol use can occur before a woman knows she is pregnant, and teratogenic risk increases if she continues to drink during pregnancy. Characterization of alcohol consumption patterns among women of childbearing age (i.e., age 18-44 years) can help identify the magnitude of this problem, the subpopulations at greatest risk, and the geographic areas in which increased prevention efforts are needed. This report presents state-specific data on the prevalence of frequent alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy often results in disorders of fetal development (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome). The brain appears to be particularly vulnerable, and alcohol abuse during pregnancy is probably the most common cause of acquired mental retardation. We therefore studied the in vitro effects of ethanol on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)- mediated proliferation of rat C6 glioblastoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The proliferation of C6 rat glioblastoma cells was measured in serum-free medium supplemented with specific growth factors in the presence or absence of ethanol. The effect of ethanol on IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, as was the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase content within IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. RESULTS: C6 cells grew slowly in serum-free medium and proliferated in response to IGF-1. Ethanol, at physiologically tolerated concentrations, markedly inhibited the growth of C6 cells in response to IGF-1, but had no effect on the proliferative rate in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor or 1% fetal bovine serum. Inhibition of cell proliferation was evident when ethanol was only present during a 1-hour pulse of IGF-1. Cell growth in the presence of IGF-2 was also prevented by ethanol. The inhibition of IGF-1-mediated cell proliferation was accompanied by abrogation of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation. Ethanol also interfered with the IGF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and the association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with IRS-1. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol inhibit the responses of glial cells to IGF-1, including IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation, IRS-1 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activation, and cell growth.

N2  - In a cohort of 532 pregnant women from the general population, it was found by compilation of the results from interviews, police records, hospital records and social welfare records that 23 mothers and 51 fathers in 64 families (12%) were suffering from alcoholism/heavy drinking. In these 64 families, the mother was an addict in only 13 families, both parents were addicts in 10 families, and in the remaining 41 families only the father was an addict. Pregnancy, delivery, the newborn child and the child's development until their fourth year of life have been described using a multidisciplinary approach and a longitudinal prospective design. An hypothesis on mental and physical development, and the occurrence of psychopathological symptoms in the children was tested. None of the children of the 13 alcoholic mothers was born with foetal alcohol syndrome, but foetal hazard was indicated by lower birth weight and a higher rate of perinatal deaths. Children of alcoholic parents had retarded mental development and showed more behavioural problems until 4 years of age than controls, but the differences related to physical development during the first year of life had then disappeared. Boys were found to be more vulnerable than girls. The consequences of behaviour seemed to be more pronounced when both parents were alcoholics. No obvious deviation was found when only the father was addicted. Regarding mental development, it appears that factors related to parental alcoholism, including genetic and social factors' and the sex of the child, are of greater importance than the neonatal score on reduced optimality.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response of immature offspring to interleukin-1: Is nitric oxide involved?
A1  - Lee S.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - We have previously shown that following prenatal alcohol exposure, immature offspring showed blunted ACTH released in response to the peripheral administration of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). The present studies were conducted to investigate the role of changes in corticosteroid feedback (measured by altered adrenal responses to ACTH), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) content of the median eminence (ME), and the influence of endogenous nitric oxide (NO). The injection of several doses of ACTH failed to indicate measurable differences between the corticosterone responses of offspring born to dams fed ad libitum [control (C)], pair-fed (PF), or fed alcohol [ethanol (EtOH) = E]. CRF content in the ME, taken as an index of the amount of releasable peptide, showed a small, but statistically significant, decrease following prenatal alcohol exposure. A comparable change, however, was also noted in PF rats. As expected, the subcutaneous injection of IL-1beta (0.5 mug/kg) induced smaller increases in plasma ACTH levels of E than C pups. The response of PF animals was intermediate between that of E and C rats. Finally, we observed that inhibition of NO formation by the administration of the arginine derivative L()nitro-L-arginine-methylester significantly augmented ACTH secretion in all three experimental groups, and reversed the decreased corticotrophs' response to IL-1beta caused by prenatal alcohol. Taken together, our results suggest that the ability of prenatal alcohol exposure to alter ACTH released by immature pups in response to blood-borne IL-1beta is probably not mediated through changes in adrenal responsiveness. We propose, on the other hand, that endogenous NO levels may be increased by the prenatal treatment, thereby interfering with the release of peptides from nerve terminals in the ME.

N2  - The most notable features of fetal alcohol syndrome involve the face and eyes, and include microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, an underdeveloped philtrum and a thin upper lip. Evidence of intrauterine or postnatal growth retardation, mental retardation or other neurologic abnormalities, and at least two of the typical facial features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Newborns with the syndrome may be irritable, with hypotonia, severe tremors and withdrawal symptoms. Mild mental retardation, the most common and serious deficit, and a variety of other anomalies may accompany fetal alcohol syndrome. Sensory deficits include optic nerve hypoplasia, poor visual acuity, hearing loss, and receptive and expressive language delays. Atrial and ventricular septal defects, as well as renal hypoplasia, bladder diverticula and other genitourinary tract abnormalities, may occur. Complete abstinence during pregnancy is recommended, since alcohol consumption in each trimester has been associated with abnormalities, and the lowest innocuous dose of alcohol is not known.

N2  - Objectives. The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on offspring's weight, height, and head circumference from birth through 14 years of age. Methods. This longitudinal prospective study examined a cohort of approximately 500 offspring (over-sampled for heavier drinkers and stratified for smoking from a population of 1529 women in prenatal care at the 5th gestational month) at birth; 8 and 18 months; and 4, 7, and 14 years of age. Covariates were examined by means of multiple regression. Birth size measures were also examined as predictors of 7-year neurodevelopmental outcomes. Results. Effects of alcohol were observed on weight, length, and head circumference at birth; these effects were not altered by adjustment for covariates including smoking. However, the birthweight effect is clearly transient; although alcohol effects remained observable at 8 months, they were not measurable thereafter through age 14 years. Conclusions. In this population-based sample, neither birthweight nor any later size measure was as useful an indicator of the enduring effects of prenatal alcohol exposure as were certain neurodevelopmental outcomes.

T1  - Radial arm maze deficits in rats exposed to alcohol during midgestation

A1  - Berman R.F.
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Radial arm maze performance was examined in juvenile and adult rats prenatally exposed to alcohol for the relatively brief period of Gestational Days 7-13. When juvenile animals (26 days of age) were trained in the radial arm maze, alcohol-exposed offspring made significantly more errors than did animals in either nutritional or ad-lib control groups during the second and third blocks of trials. However, by the end of training, alcohol-exposed offspring performed the task at the same level as control animals. When these animals were retested at 90 days of age, radial arm maze performance was comparable to that of control animals, suggesting that once acquired, radial arm maze performance is retained into adulthood in animals prenatally exposed to alcohol. When radial arm maze training began in adulthood (90 days of age), rats prenatally exposed to alcohol demonstrated deficient radial arm maze performance. Thus, early behavioral experience may be useful for treating prenatal-alcohol-exposure-induced deficits in learning and memory.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF) induces platelet aggregation and hypotension. It has been implicated in embryonic implantation, fetal lung maturation, and parturition. Alcohol abuse is associated with platelet dysfunction, chronic hypertension, and alcohol-related birth defects. We hypothesized that alcohol may cause, in part, these effects by increasing the activity of PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), thereby decreasing PAF concentration. Pregnant mice were given 3.5 g/kg of alcohol orally twice daily from gestation days 7-17. PAF-AH was measured on gestation days 5, 14, and 19 in pregnant females. Nonpregnant females were treated and sampled at parallel time intervals. Pair-fed and untreated control groups were also used. The maternal plasma PAF-AH decreased with gestational age in the untreated controls. Alcohol significantly increased PAF-AH levels in both the pregnant and nonpregnant animals. PAF deficiency might contribute to the tocolytic action of alcohol, as well as some alcohol-related pregnancy complications.

N2  - Little is known about the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. There are even fewer reports on the longitudinal effects of exposure to either marijuana or tobacco during pregnancy. This study is on the 6-year follow-up of 668 children enrolled in the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project. Mothers were interviewed at the 4th and 7th months of pregnancy, and mothers and children were evaluated at delivery, 8, and 18 months, and 3 and 6 years postpartum. At 6 years of age, children who were exposed to alcohol prenatally were significantly smaller in weight, height, head circumference, and palpebral fissure width. These effects on size were mediated by the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the offspring at 8 months. Prenatal alcohol exposure was also significantly associated with maternal reports of the child's appetite at 6 years. There were no effects of prenatal marijuana or tobacco exposure on growth when the children were age 6. There were also no significant relationships between prenatal exposure to alcohol, marijuana, or tobacco and the rate of morphologic anomalies, including the features of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - Ethanol elimination in alcohol-treated pregnant rats
A1  - Traves C.
A1  - Lopez-Tejero D.
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - The effects of chronic intake of alcohol on ethanol elimination were studied in 20-day pregnant rats, in their foetuses, and in virgin rats. Experimental animals received ethanol in drinking water (from 10% to 25% in 2 months) (alcohol group), whereas controls drank only water. At the end of chronic exposure, alcohol dehydrogenase activity was determined in stomach and liver and cytochrome P-450 was measured in liver. In a complementary assay, the same experimental groups of rats were given an acute dose of ethanol (2 g/kg body wt, 25% w/v) either intragastrically or intraperitoneally, at the end of the chronic exposure, to determine first-pass ethanol metabolism and pharmacokinetic parameters of its elimination. Significant differences were found between alcohol and control groups for liver and stomach alcohol dehydrogenase activity in pregnant rats. Only in virgins did chronic alcohol treatment significantly increase the liver cytochrome P-450 content. In virgin rats, the first-pass metabolism of ethanol was lower in the alcohol group than in control. By contrast, in control rats, the first-pass of ethanol was lower in pregnant, than in virgin, rats. The metabolic rate of ethanol elimination (mg/kg body wt/hr) was clearly enhanced in alcoholic virgin rats, demonstrating that this model of chronic alcoholism induces metabolic tolerance to ethanol. In alcoholic pregnant rats, a surprisingly low theoretical volume of body ethanol distribution (55 ml/100 g body wt vs. 80 ml/100 g body wt in the other groups) masked their metabolic tolerance to ethanol. This preliminary study should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of chronic or/and acute alcohol intake during pregnancy on the circulating ethanol levels in foetuses and on future development of the foetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to cause damage to the central nervous system. This study sought to further elucidate the structural brain damage that occurs following prenatal alcohol exposure in both children and rats. Two children with histories of maternal alcohol abuse but who did not qualify for a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), based on established criteria, underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Reduced volumes were found for the cerebrum and cerebellum. In addition, the proportional volume of the basal ganglia was reduced, although the proportional volumes of cortical and subcortical fluid, cortical gray matter, limbic and nonlimbic cortex, and diencephalic structures were unaffected. These findings are compared with our recent MRI findings in two cases of FAS. In addition, the caudate-putamen and ventricular areas were assessed in rats exposed to alcohol prenatally. Whereas the overall brain section area was not reduced in size, the area of the caudate-putamen was reduced and that of the ventricles was enlarged.

N2  - The purpose of this follow-up study was to assess and describe early cognitive impairments in two-year-old children exposed to alcohol (1) until the second trimester (n = 20), (2) until the third trimester (n = 20), (3) throughout pregnancy (n = 20), (4) children to mothers with preeclampsia (n = 37), (5) children surviving acute birth asphyxia (n = 14), and (6) a normal control group (n = 48). Alcohol exposure throughout pregnancy was found to be associated with impairments in language (mean SD score = -1.3) and visuo-motor development (mean SD score = -2.0). Preeclampsia was related to impairment in visuo-motor development (mean SD score = -1.2) and attention (mean SD score = -0.7). Alcohol exposure until the third trimester was associated with attention deficit alone (mean SD score = -0.9). Alcohol exposure until the second trimester and acute birth asphyxia were not associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment.

N2  - A large and compelling experimental literature has documented the adverse impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain of the offspring. This is the first report of adolescent attention, memory performance and its relationship with prenatal alcohol exposure in a population-based, longitudinal, prospective study (n = 462) involving substantial covariate control and 'blind' examiners. Prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly related to attention/memory deficits in a dose-dependent fashion. A latent variable reflecting 13 measures of maternal drinking was correlated 0.26 with a latent variable representing 52 scores from 6 tests measuring various components of attention and short-term memory performance. The number of drinks/occasion was the strongest alcohol predictor. Fluctuating attentional states, problems with response inhibition, and spatial learning showed the strongest association with prenatal alcohol exposure. A latent variable reflecting the pattern of attention/memory deficits observed at 14 years correlated 0.67 with a composite pattern of deficits previously detected on neurobehavioral tests administered during the first 7 years of life. The 14- year attention/memory deficits observed in the present study appear to be the adolescent sequelae of deficits observed earlier in development. As is usual in such studies, not all exposed offspring showed deficits.

N2  - It is now well established that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy (greater than 8 units/day; 1 unit = 1/2 pint beer, 1 glass of wine or a single measure of spirits) can result in a child with fetal alcohol syndrome and a more moderate intake has been associated with birth weight reduction, perinatal complications, poor mental development and spontaneous miscarriage. There is little information on the effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption on miscarriage in a British population. Current community surveys estimate that 37 per cent of women of childbearing age (16-44) years) drink more than 5 units each week. This current study describes drinking and smoking patterns in a sample of women who miscarried in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on serial-pattern learning was investigated in adult rats. Pregnant dams were administered a liquid diet which contained 35% ethanol-derived calories (35% EDC) on days 6-20 of gestation. Two control groups were included: a liquid diet control which was pair-fed and had sucrose substituted for ethanol (0% EDC); and a group fed standard lab chow throughout pregnancy. Offspring from each of these prenatal groups were trained to run a straight alley for food pellets. Pellet amount on successive trials was 14, 7, 3, 1, 7. Subjects were exposed to this pattern four times a day for 8 consecutive days. The mean latency to enter the goalbox for the four trials that comprised a monotonically decreasing series of pellet amounts (14, 7, 3, 1) was indirectly related to pellet amount. The mean latency on each trial and the degree of change in running speed across trials was found to be directly related to in utero alcohol exposure. Alcohol exposed offspring demonstrated less change in latencies over trials than controls. Also, the mean latency on the last trial for 7 pellets was shorter than that seen on the previous trial (1 pellet) and similar to that seen after the first trial in which 7 pellets were available. This indicated that satiation was not a factor in the increasing latencies. These data indicate a deficit in serial pattern performance as a function of prenatal alcohol exposure similar to what is observed in children with FAS.

N2  - Peripheral vasodilatation with increased cardiac output, tachycardia and increased blood pressure are described after alcohol administration. An increased HDL-cholesterol is found in moderate drinkers (both HDL-2 and HDL-3 fractions), with diminishing risk of coronary heart diseases. Acute ethanol intake causes an increased the level of triglycerides without changes in HDL-cholesterol level. This may be put into correlation with higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases in so-called "week-end" drinkers. Alcohol abuse may result in central diabetes insipidus. An increased elimination of lactate diminishes tubular secretion of uric acid with subsequent secondary hyperuricemia. Ethanol reduced the number of lymphocytes, reduces phagocytosis by macrophages and diminishes the activity of NK-cells. Bone marrow cellulity diminishes with the subsequent reduction in erythropoiesis, trombopoiesis and leukopoiesis. Alcohol may cause sideropenic and megaloblastic anemia. There are two forms of alcohol muscle injury: the acute one, with myonecrosis and inflammatory reaction, and chronic one, with muscle weakness and atrophy. Alcohol is one of etiologic factors of osteoporosis. An acute intoxication result in transitory hypoparatthyreoidism, while chronic ethanol intake make grow the PTH level and decreases the level of D vitamin metabolises. Stimulation of cortisol secretion, decrease of testosterone level and a reversible decrease of T3 and T4 levels have been described following ethanol administration. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suffers alteration in alcoholics, and secondary amenorrhea is observed in female alcoholics. Ethanol behaves as an agonist on GABA receptor. Fetal alcohol syndrome together with Down's syndrome and spina bifida are the most frequent reasons of mental retardation in developed countries. Toxicity of ethanol affects the whole pregnancy period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Teratogenesis of alcohol
A1  - Spagnolo A.
Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Many studies describing the teratogenic effects of alcohol have been published since Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first identified in 1973. Specifically, it has been a widely documented that alcohol is a teratogen that causes brain, craniofacial, and limb abnormalities in children suffering from FAS. These children have also been shown to be at high risk for mental deficiencies. Teratogenicity has only been observed in offspring of mothers who consume large quantities of alcohol during pregnancy, while the effects of moderate drinking, though linked with adverse fetal alcohol effects in many reports, are not yet clear. Studies have also shown that teratogenic effects of paternal drinking on newborns. Estimates of prevalence at birth of FAS range from 1.9 to 0.33 per 1,000 births, depending on race, population, socioeconomic status, etc. New hypotheses on the biochemical basis of ethanol-induced birth defects have been recently proposed, contributing to the understanding of alcohol teratogenicity. The following review focuses on major recent findings in this field and describes the current situation regarding FAS.

N2  - There is considerable variation in the consequences of alcohol abuse during pregnancy on infant outcome. Although it is clear that a number of factors contribute to this variability, one hypothesis that has received recent attention is the role of genetic differences in response to alcohol. This study examined activity levels in the alcohol-preferring (P) and alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) rats following neonatal alcohol exposure. Although these lines were selectively bred for differences in voluntary alcohol consumption, they also differ in their sensitivity and tolerance to alcohol. The P and NP offspring were artificially reared and administered ethanol (either 6 or 4 g/kg/day) from postnatal day 4 (PN 4) until PN 10 via intragastric cannula. An artificially reared isocaloric maltose group and a normally reared control group were also included. From PN 18 to PN 21, subjects were tested daily for 30 min in an automated activity monitor. Exposure to either the 4 or 6 g/kg dose of ethanol resulted in overactivity in P rats. However, only the 6 g/kg dose group displayed overactivity among the NP offspring. Furthermore, the level of overactivity displayed by the alcohol-exposed P rats was significantly greater than that displayed by the alcohol-exposed NP rats. These data suggest that genetic differences in response to alcohol may be a predictor for the behavioral teratogenic effects of alcohol.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure in the rat is known to interfere with the neurobehavioral sexual differentiation of the male brain. Because normal sexual differentiation of the male brain requires adequate levels of perinatal testosterone, we examined the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on (1) the postnatal surge of testosterone and (2) the in vitro secretion of testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation of testes from fetal alcohol exposed (FAE) animals and controls. Sprague-Dawley dams were administered a fortified liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories, a pair-fed (PF) isocaloric liquid diet, or given ad libitum access to dry lab chow (CF). Dams were administered the liquid diets from days 7 or 14 through parturition. The postnatal surge of testosterone in FAE males was studied only in animals exposed to ethanol from day 14 through parturition. In the first experiment, FAE and PF males and females were delivered by cesarian section on day 22 of gestation (E22) and trunk blood collected at 0, 60, 120, and 240 min after parturition. Experiment 2 measured plasma testosterone in male pups that were killed at 0, 60, 120, 240, 360, and 480 min after delivery. Results showed that the postnatal testosterone surge of FAE males in both experiments was significantly attenuated compared with PF controls. No effect of prenatal ethanol was observed in female offspring. Female testosterone levels were several fold lower than male littermates, and no evidence of a postnatal testosterone surge was observed. Production of testosterone from testes was studied using an automated perifusion system. The secretory testosterone response to LH stimulation of testes on day 18 (E18) of gestation and at birth (E22) was similar in testes from FAE animals to that observed in testes from PF and CF controls. The response of all testes to a pulse of LH (5 nM) delivered over a 5-min period (flow rate = 200 mul/min) from animals at E18 was significantly greater than the response observed at day 22. No morphological abnormalities were detected by visual inspection of electron photomicrographs of testes from FAE animals at E18 or E22. The in vitro response to LH of testes from FAE animals indicates that the reduction in the postnatal testosterone surge in FAE animals is not due to a decrease in testicular sensitivity to LH.

N2  - Cross-sectional analyses have demonstrated that prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in growth deficits at birth and in early childhood. However, there have been few longitudinal analyses of this relationship. This study presents an analysis of the longitudinal effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth. The model used for analysis was a general unbalanced repeated-measures model with a fully parameterized covariance matrix. Application of the model demonstrated that for length and head circumference, the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure was constant over time. The relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and growth in weight was more complex. Prenatal alcohol exposure affected the rate of growth between birth and the eight month. Subsequently, the relationship between weight and prenatal alcohol exposure was constant. Therefore, for length and head circumference, prenatal alcohol exposure suppresses the rate of growth in the fetus but not at subsequent time points. For weight exposure affects the rate of growth through the eight month but not at subsequent time points. For each of the growth parameters, there is no catch-up growth, and the smaller size observed in the offspring is maintained.

N2  - Rats exposed prenatally to alcohol have shown deficits in spatial learning in radial-arm and Morris mazes. Prenatal exposure to alcohol in rats has also been shown to alter central nervous system (CNS) cholinergic function. Since cholinergic dysfunction disrupts spatial learning in normal rats, the present experiment assessed the role of putative prenatal alcohol-induced cholinergic dysfunction in spatial learning in rats. Pregnant rats were fed alcohol via liquid diet from gestation day 6 to 20. Control dams were pair-fed liquid diet without alcohol or fed ad lib lab chow and water. Group housed adult male and female offspring (postnatal days 110 to 135) were given scopolamine- HCl (0, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg/day) and tested in a Morris maze, with four trials per day for four days. A 15-s probe trial preceded testing on days 2-4. On day 5, the rats were given four trials to learn a new platform location. Scopolamine produced dose-dependent increases in latency to find the platform for all groups. There were no significant differences among prenatal treatment groups in scopolamine-induced shifts in performance. The results did not support the hypothesis that prenatal alcohol-induced CNS cholinergic dysfunction is related to spatial learning performance in these rats.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure blunts interleukin-1-induced ACTH and beta- endorphin secretion by immature rats
A1  - Lee S.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - The functional relationship between the immune and the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [and in particular the release of pro- opiomelanocortin (POMC)-related peptides and corticosteroids induced by interleukins (ILs)] is essential for coordinating the appropriate immune responses to pathogens. Exposure of pregnant mammalian females to alcohol results in abnormal immune functions in the offspring, as well as in altered HPA axis activity. We therefore tested the hypothesis that prenatal alcohol exposure might modify the stimulatory action of ILs on the HPA axis of the pups, thus providing a mechanisms through which this treatment results in increased rate of infectious or inflammatory processes. Pregnant dams were fed a liquid alcohol diet throughout gestation. Dams with free access to food (ad libitum group), or dams fed an isocaloric diet in which sucrose replaced alcohol (pair-feeding), were also included. At 22-24 days of age, the pups were injected intraperitoneally with IL-1beta, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), or the vehicle. Blood samples obtained 1-2 hr later indicated that the alcohol diet resulted in significantly blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin, but not corticosterone release, in response to IL- 1beta. Pair-fed pups also showed some decrease in their pituitary response, although to a lesser degree. In contrast, there was no measurable difference in the ability of CRF to increase plasma ACTH levels. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol interferes with the stimulatory action of IL-1beta on the secretion of POMC-related peptides, a phenomenon probably not caused by decreased pituitary responsiveness to CRF. As pups born to pair- fed dams also exhibited a measurable, although less significant, decrease in IL-induced ACTH and beta-endorphin release, a possible synergism between caloric restriction and alcohol also needs to be ascertained. We propose that the ability of prenatal alcohol treatment to blunt the release of POMC- related peptides in response to IL-1beta may participate in the abnormal immune functions of the offspring.

N2  - Visual impairment is one of the most common ophthalmic abnormalities in fetal alcohol syndrome. Pathologic changes in optic nerve development related to alcohol consumption could be involved in this dysfunction. In order to assess the consequences of pre- and postnatal exposure to alcohol on the developing optic nerve, we administered an ethanol-containing liquid diet (5% w/v) before and during gestation and throughout lactation to rats and their offspring. A group of control animals were kept on a pair-fed isocaloric diet. The optic nerves were obtained at key stages from fetuses (21 days of gestation) and pups (4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 postnatal days). Samples of the optic nerve cross-section, behind the eyeball, were processed for analysis of gliogenesis, myelinogenesis, axonal growth, and remodelling events, using light and electron microscopy. Qualitative, morphometric, and immunocytochemical analyses, alternatively using anti-GFAP and anti-MBP antibodies, were carried out. Optic nerve cross-sections from prenatal and postnatal alcohol-exposed rats showed a decrease in size. Ultrastructural alterations and retarded development in macroglial cells, optic axons, and myelin sheath were also observed. The most prominent abnormalities were: damage of cytoplasmic organelles and disorganization of cytoskeleton in astrocytes; a decrease in free ribosome density and nuclear membrane inclusions in oligodendrocytes; and fragmentation of lamellae, aberrant myelin sheaths and intralamellar inclusions in myelin. These findings suggest that alcohol abuse during pregnancy is teratogenic to the optic nerve and closely related to the altered visual function.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - There has been concern since antiquity that the ingestion of alcohol by the pregnant woman could damage the fetus, but it was not until 1973 that the fetal alcohol syndrome was first described. The broad effect of alcohol- related birth defects, including fetal alcohol effects (FAE), has become apparent even more recently. Physicians can play a central role in the prevention of alcohol-related birth defects through early detection, education of the mother, and appropriate referrals. This paper reviews the effects of maternal alcohol use on the fetus, discusses the importance of assessing alcohol use among all women of child bearing age, and examines intervention strategies that physicians can use to help pregnant women stop or reduce alcohol use. Funding for this paper was provided by the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - The effects of prenatal alcohol treatment on the development and in vitro phosphorylation of specific neuronal phosphoproteins isolated from the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rat brains were studied. In vitro phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) was decreased in the frontal cortex but not the hippocampus of animals exposed prenatally to alcohol. Phosphorylation of additional phosphoproteins, including tau proteins, Synapsin I, and GAP-43, was not affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Littermates of animals used for the phosphorylation assays showed impaired passive avoidance learning. These data demonstrate that the previously reported structural changes in the development of the cerebral cortex following prenatal alcohol exposure and behavioral deficits are accompanied by changes in the phosphorylation of the important cytoskeletal protein MAP-2.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to present a series of case reports of infants and young children who were exposed to alcohol prenatally. The five infants and two 5-year-old twins in this series all presented facial features characteristic of prenatal alcohol exposure, and all had medical histories of maternal alcohol abuse. The neuromotor and cognitive development of these seven children is described by presenting results of standardized tests administered longitudinally. In addition, clinical observations of growth, behavior, feeding, and musculoskeletal development are provided. Following a discussion of these assessment results, implications for physical therapy intervention and the need for clinical research are provided. Because children with fetal alcohol syndrome or alcohol-related birth defects present a spectrum of developmental differences that often include areas of concern to physical therapists, we need to increase our involvement in the assessment and treatment of these children as well as in research efforts to examine the efficacy of these interventions.

T1  - Ethanol alters hormone production in cultured human placental trophoblasts
A1  - Karl P.I.
A1  - Fisher S.E.
Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can lead to abnormalities in fetal development, including the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Although intrauterine growth retardation is a hallmark of FAS, the pathophysiology is not fully understood. A contributing factor may be altered placental function, which could affect fetal growth and development. As a major endocrine organ during pregnancy, changes in the production of placental hormones could affect pregnancy and possibly fetal development. In this study, the effect of continued exposure to ethanol on placental hormone production was examined using cultured human placental trophoblasts. Ethanol exposure involved diffusion of ethanol from the atmosphere into the culture medium. This was refreshed daily, leading to daily peak concentrations of 280 to 300 mg/dl (60-65 mM) at 16 to 24 hr. This ethanol exposure for 2 or 4 days significantly increased the production of human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone by the cultured trophoblasts. However, ethanol treatment had no effect on human placental lactogen production. Acute stimulation (10 min) of cultured trophoblasts with adenosine (50 muM) normally results in increased production of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). With ethanol exposure, adenosine-stimulated cAMP production was significantly elevated relative to that in controls. However, the effect of ethanol on adenosine- stimulated cAMP did not appear to be secondary to chronic alterations in adenosine in the culture medium. Measurement of adenosine in the culture medium revealed no difference in concentration or production between control and ethanol treated groups. Moreover, chronic (24 hr) pretreatment of trophoblasts with 0.2 to 10 muM additional adenosine before acute adenosine stimulation did not alter the cAMP response in either control or ethanol- treated cells. This study demonstrates that ethanol exposure may alter placental production of hormones, specifically those that are cAMP dependent.

N2  - Exposure to ethanol in utero compromises the offspring's developing immune and endocrine systems. Persistent functional changes, particularly in T- cell-dependent aspects of immunity and in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity, are commonly seen. The present study examined the degree to which fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) during development suppressed the lymphocyte proliferative response to Concanavalin-A (Con A). We also examined the effect of maternal adrenalectomy on the expression of glucocorticoid-regulated genes and the response to Con A in FAE offspring. Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was stably suppressed (between 28-46%) in FAE males compared to isocalorically pair-fed offspring at 7, 21, 40, and 60 days of age. In contrast, lymphocyte proliferation in the immature or peripubertal FAE female was totally unaffected. In 60-day- old male rats, maternal adrenalectomy reversed the FAE-induced suppression of Con A-stimulated proliferation, but had no effect on lymphocyte proliferation. FAE increased anterior pituitary POMC (the precursor of ACTH) mRNA levels dramatically in males, and this increase was also reversed by maternal adrenalectomy. In both sexes, anterior pituitary glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels were unaffected by prenatal alcohol exposure alone, but were significantly decreased in male and increased in female offspring of adrenalectomized dams ingesting alcohol. Furthermore, in male, but not female, offspring, hypothalamic levels of glucocorticoid receptor and CRF mRNA were increased significantly by FAE alone or in combination with maternal adrenalectomy. In female, but not male, offspring, maternal adrenalectomy with concomitant alcohol exposure increased anterior pituitary POMC mRNA levels compared to that in sham/pair-fed offspring. In summary, FAE induced a gender-specific impairment of Con A- stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. This deficit is present both before and after puberty, demonstrating its stability into adulthood. Furthermore, in males, maternal adrenalectomy reversed these FAE-induced deficits in T-cell function as well as the effect of FAE on anterior pituitary POMC expression. This supports the hypothesis that maternal adrenal hormones participate in the immunosuppressive 'imprinting' of the FAE fetus and are, therefore, causally implicated in the sexually dimorphic T-cell dysfunction found in FAE offspring.

N2  - The hypothesis was tested that prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts developmental homeostasis, as reflected in increased dermatoglyphic fluctuating asymmetry. Twenty-two patients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 9 with fetal alcohol effect (FAE) were matched for sex with 31 controls. On each patient, the right a-b dermal ridge count was subtracted from the left to obtain the asymmetry value. Group differences were tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA), and paired two-tailed t tests. Mean asymmetry increased from control (1.94) through FAE (2.78) to the FAS (4.00) group. Group differences were significant by ANOVA (p = 0.0066); only the FAS and control group differed by t test (p = 0.0025). The results support the hypothesis of increased decanalization of prenatal development in the presence of alcohol.

N2  - Maternal ethanol consumption has deleterious effects on the offspring's neuroendocrine and T-cell-dependent functions. Chronic alcohol consumption in adulthood has also been associated with activated hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) function and immunosuppression which is demonstrable at the T- cell level. Our aim was to establish whether prenatal alcohol exposure alters the neuroendocrine and immune responses to chronic alcohol challenge in adult male and female offspring. Adult male rats placed on a liquid alcohol diet for 5 weeks had significantly decreased thymus weight, hypertrophied adrenals, and elevated plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels. Splenic lymphocyte Concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated proliferation in the ethanol- treated rats was decreased compared to that in pair-fed controls. Thus, prolonged alcohol exposure activated the HPA axis and suppressed T-cell function. The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, as a predispositional factor, on the HPA axis and on the T-cell functions of adult chronic alcohol- exposed rats were examined in the offspring of dams fed ethanol (FAE) or an isocaloric liquid (PF) diet during the last 2 weeks of gestation. The adult offspring of both sexes and prenatal treatment groups were then placed on an alcohol-containing liquid diet for 5 weeks. Fetal alcohol exposure decreased anterior pituitary proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels and increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA levels in males and decreased GR mRNA levels in females. There were no differences in hypothalamic CRF mRNA and GR mRNA levels between the prenatal treatment groups. There was no significant difference in Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation between FAE and PF males. However, FAE females showed Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation significantly higher than those of all other groups, including pair-fed females. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) suppressed lymphocyte proliferation to a lesser degree in FAE males than in any other group. Furthermore, T-cell response to Con A was enhanced by indomethacin, a prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibitor, in FAE males suggesting that increased prostaglandin synthesis may occur in FAE males after chronic alcohol exposure. Increased levels of endogenous PGE2 could also be inferred from the enhanced levels of interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha) mRNA in activated lymphocytes of male but not of female FAE offspring compared to PF. In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure leads to a specific HPA- related vulnerability in males to the deleterious effects of ethanol in adulthood. Although prenatal alcohol did not further aggravate the effects of chronic alcohol exposure on lymphocyte proliferation response to Con A in adult male offspring, altered T-cell responses could be unmasked.

N2  - Animals exposed prenatally to alcohol (4 g/kg/day) via maternal peroral intubation or control offspring were reared after weaning either alone in standard steel/wire cages or in groups of eight, for 6 weeks. Rats exposed prenatally to alcohol and reared in isolation had a dysmetric stride length indicative of an ataxic gait. However, following postweaning environmental enrichment, prenatal alcohol-exposed rats showed no evidence of ataxia. In addition, the prenatal alcohol-exposed rats showed the same magnitude of improved Morris maze performance after enrichment as did the control offspring. These preliminary results suggest that postnatal environment can influence the expression of alcohol-related birth defects in rats, that rats exposed prenatally to alcohol can benefit from the effects of enriched postweaning environment and that postnatal factors can attenuate some of the deficits due to prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Ontogenesis is closely related to the ability to adapt to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. However, this precondition for viability does not remain stable; it changes in correlation to the phases of life. In this long-term study with rats, the extent to which moderate prenatal damage influences the adaptability in the juvenile, adult and senile phases was examined. For this purpose rat fetuses were exposed to alcohol (6 g/kg bw/day) by treating the pregnant rats via drinking water from gestation days 7 to 17. In the juvenile phase (0-3 months), no substantial differences in comparison to controls were recorded. Exceptions were a delayed development in the negative geotaxis (posture reflex) and a transiently higher exploratory activity in the open field test. In the adult phase (> 3-27 months), reduced performance was observed in basic functions such as body temperature regulation. Additionally, diminished performance was seen in response to high demands in motor-coordination (rotorod). During the senile phase (> 27 months), impairment of nearly all tested functions occurred earlier and was more pronounced.

N2  - Maternal use of alcohol during gestation is associated with FAS and less severe problems in exposed children, such as FAE and ARBD. This article reviewed the literature concerning the status of affected and exposed neonates and the available information on the developmental course of infants and children. Physical and behavioral characteristics of gestational alcohol exposure were described, and outcomes of retrospective and prospective research were reviewed. Currently, it is evident that heavy use and bingeing are associated with an increased risk to the offspring across a range of outcomes. Although the last 20 years of research in this area have provided a great deal of information, there remain unanswered questions regarding the course of the affected individual over the lifespan, the neuropsychologic status of children, and the relationship of prenatal exposure and the caregiving environment to the observed outcomes.

N2  - Three of four siblings born to parents with a history of heavy alcohol abuse had bilateral diffusely cloudy corneas at birth. These three siblings, who had mild systemic features of fetal alcohol syndrome, underwent corneal transplantations, and their specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy. Histologically, the alterations in Bowman's layer ranged from thickening to total loss. There were varying degrees of corneal stromal edema. The unique pathologic feature in the corneas was the anomaly of the anterior banded zone of Descemet's membrane, which was either absent, poorly formed, or thinned in the central and peripheral cornea. The corneal endothelium was attenuated or multilayered. The diffuse clouding and the range of histologic abnormalities in the corneas might be related to the maternal alcohol abuse.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a leading cause of congenital mental retardation but little is known about the long-term development and adolescent outcome of children with FAS. In a 10-year follow-up study of 60 patients diagnosed as having FAS in infancy and childhood, we investigated the long-term sequelae of intrauterine alcohol exposure. We found that the characteristic craniofacial malformations of FAS diminish with time, but microcephaly and, to a lesser degree, short stature and underweight (in boys) persist; in female adolescents body weight normalises. Persistent mental retardation is the major sequela of intrauterine alcohol exposure in many cases, and environmental and educational factors do not have strong compensatory effects on the intellectual development of affected children.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Clinical studies have shown that behavioral and electrophysiological abnormalities occur in some human infants born to alcoholic mothers. The present study used rats to evaluate the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on locomotor behavior and two paradigms for the generation of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Pregnant rats were fed liquid diets, one group received alcohol and the other was a nutritional control. The offspring were allowed to mature prior to the electrophysiological and behavioral testing. Prenatal alcohol exposed rats showed significantly more locomotor behavior in the first 4 hours of their activity cycle than nonethanol exposed rats, although not over a subsequent 8-hour period. Evaluation of the electrophysiological data revealed that the prenatal alcohol exposed group had significantly longer latencies of their P1 and N1 ERP components, in the hippocampus, than the control group. These results support anatomical data suggesting that the hippocampus may be an important area in which to direct further study of what brain mechanisms may be altered by prenatal ethanol exposure in the rat.

N2  - Results of previous studies of effects of drinking during pregnancy on standardized tests of infant development have varied, depending on level of exposure. This study of 382 Black, inner city infants confirmed effects of moderate-to-heavy prenatal alcohol exposure on Bayley Scale performance originally observed in a White, middle class cohort. Effects of second and third trimester drinking were as strong or stronger than those of drinking at the time of conception. New methods for reducing the Bayley Scale data suggested specific deficits relating to emergence of the ability to imitate modeled behavior and the development of standing and walking. The incidence of very poor performance (bottom 10th percentile) on the Bayley Mental Development Index more than doubled in children whose mothers averaged at least 0.5 oz absolute alcohol per day during pregnancy, indicating that this exposure has a clinically meaningful impact at markedly lower levels than those associated with full fetal alcohol syndrome. Clinically meaningful effects on the Psychomotor Development Index, by contrast, were seen only in the infants of heavy drinking mothers with overt symptomatology of alcohol abuse. Adverse effects on Bayley Scale performance were more prevalent in the infants of women more than 30 years of age.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a variety of developmental abnormalities, including neuroanatomical, physical, and behavioral features. Several mechanisms for alcohol's teratogenic effects have been proposed. This study addresses the role of prostaglandins in the abnormal development that often occurs after maternal alcohol consumption. On gestation days 8 to 18, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were prenatally treated with 6 g/kg alcohol following pretreatment with 150 mg/kg aspirin. Behavioral testing of offspring included measures of open-field activity, exploratory behavior, passive avoidance, active avoidance, and acoustic startle response. In most cases, pretreatment with aspirin did not affect performance in alcohol-exposed or control rats.

N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes malformations of the eyes with serious consequences to the vision of the affected children. A high percentage (up to 90 per cent) of children suffering from the fetal alcohol syndrome have eye abnormalities of different kinds. The most typical are hypoplasia of the optic nervehead and increased tortuosity of the retinal vessels, especially of the arteries, both occurring in up to half of the cases. Visual acuity is often reduced. Considering the developmental timing of different tissues of the eye, one can presume that there is a risk for deleterious effects of alcohol on eye structures at any point of time from early gestation until development is completed.

Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of prenatal alcohol effects. To examine this hypothesis, the ontogeny of thermoregulation was measured in prenatal ethanol exposed offspring of mice selected for differences in alcohol sensitivity. Pregnant long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice were exposed to 3 or 4 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin twice per day from day 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Doses were given six hours apart via gavage. Nonintubated lab chow controls were included for both genotypes. Offspring were fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred strain. Offspring temperatures were measured at 0, 60, and 120 min away from the nest on alternating days from 7 through 21 days of age. LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to the high ethanol dose showed lower temperatures at the 60 and 120 min time points on each day of testing compared to all other treatment groups. Temperatures of offspring prenatally exposed to the low ethanol dose did not differ from controls. These results suggest a relatively steep dose-response curve for thermoregulatory deficits in LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to alcohol. Genetically-based alcohol sensitivity did not influence the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on this response.

N2  - Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in 1973, significant inroads have been made towards understanding the effects of alcohol on fetal development. However, it is not clear if these findings are considered clinically relevant by pediatricians. This survey was designed to assess clinical knowledge, practice, and attitudes concerning alcohol-related birth defects. Data were collected in a questionnaire that was mailed to 234 randomly selected Massachusetts pediatricians. Responses suggest that a substantial proportion of pediatricians have knowledge about the effects of alcohol on pregnancy. However, many considered themselves unprepared to deal with this topic. More physicians suspected FAS/FAE than made the diagnosis. Almost three fourths reported they would find professional education in this area helpful. Broader dissemination of research findings in clinically relevant formats and improving the sense of preparedness among pediatricians have the potential to improve the care of children born to heavily drinking pregnant women.

T1  - Congenital defects of the limbs and alcohol exposure in pregnancy: Data from a population based study
A1  - Froster U.G.

Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Limb deficiency may occur in offspring prenatally exposed to alcohol. In a study on limb deficiency occurring in 1,213,913 consecutive liveborn infants in British Columbia, born in the years 1952-1984, a total of 659 cases with limb deficiency was identified. Cases with documented maternal alcohol abuse in pregnancy in this group were analyzed separately. We found eight cases with severe prenatal alcohol exposure (6 F, 2 M). In six of the eight cases a terminal transverse defect of the forearm or hand was present. In the remaining two cases ulnar defects were identified. These observations give further support to the hypothesis that intrauterine alcohol exposure may cause limb defects. This has also been demonstrated in experimental animals. Terminal transverse defects made up a larger proportion of cases with known alcohol exposure (6/8) than of cases where alcohol exposure was not noted (217/651) (chi2 = 6.13; P < 0.025) in this study. The defects primarily involved the right hand and forearm. This suggests a vascular origin of the limb defects after intrauterine alcohol exposure.

T1  - Alcohol and narcotics: Epidemiology and pregnancy risks
A1  - Olegard R.
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Among alcohol and narcotics, alcohol is most comprehensively documented as a teratogen. However, for all other narcotics, data are continuously accumulating, convincingly displaying the teratogenic effects. The proportions between 'somatic' teratogenicity and 'behavioral' teratogenicity vary between the different agents. Preventive work in prenatal clinics and among social workers, as well as objective mass media attention to the problem, seems to have lowered the incidence of severe fetal alcohol syndrome where the above-mentioned activities have been practiced. The female alcohol consumption in Sweden decreased from 1976 to 1985; thereafter, a slow continuous increase is underway again. In Sweden the number of recruits to narcotic abuse peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s. Thereafter, the number of recruits among females decreased, but abuse has continued among the members of the older age groups.

N2  - The thymoproliferative response to concanavalin A (ConA) following fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) is higher than control (149%) on day 44, is lower than control (64%) by day 51, and normalizes by day 69 (88% of controls). The ontogeny of HLA-Dr and transferrin receptor (CD71) expression in response to anti-CD3 stimulation is similar among the groups, but is distinct from that of ConA proliferation. The ontogeny of glucocorticoid cytoplasmic receptor (GCCR) sites per thymocyte is also different from the ontogeny of the ConA response. The number of GCCR sites rises sharply (2.5-fold) in control rat thymocytes between days 30 and 44, and remains at that level at later time points. By contrast, the number of GCCR sites per FAE thymocytes rises nearly linearly and normalizes by day 72. Our data support the notion that prenatal alcohol exposure significantly alters thymic development and indicates that the relationship between the development of thymocyte functional responses and that of GCCR is more complex than initially hypothesized.

N2  - Adult rats exposed to prenatal alcohol were evaluated for their susceptibility to either hormone- or chemical-inducing tumors. In the first study, rats exposed to prenatal alcohol displayed an increased propensity to beta-estradiol (E2)-induced adenohypophyseal prolactinoma. The susceptibility was manifest as a potentiated increase in anterior pituitary weight as well as in serum prolactin levels after 1 and 3 weeks but not 5 weeks of hormone treatment. Two weeks after withdrawing the E2-implant, the prolactinoma underwent involution and serum prolactin reversed to baseline levels. The high concentrations of serum corticosterone were also reduced but did not return to baseline levels after E2 removal. In the second study, nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) was utilized to induce esophageal cancer in adult rats. There were no significant differences in tumor incidence or size between the prenatal alcohol-exposed and the pair-fed cohorts. However, the NMBA-treated prenatal alcohol-exposed rats displayed a marked decrease in thymus: body wt ratio as well as adrenal gland hyperplasia. The results suggest that no single mechanism can account for the variable susceptibility displayed by the prenatal alcohol-exposed rats to chemical carcinogens. Some of the observed changes, however, may be attributable to the long-lasting adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the well-being of the adult host.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a set of signs and symptoms in offsprings born to mothers who abuse alcohol during pregnancy. We postulated that impairment in the placental endocrine function contribute to FAS. In this study, we examined in vitro effects of ethanol on the placental cells' (cytotrophoblast cells) capacity to synthesize progesterone. Cytotrophoblast cells were isolated from normal term placenta and were incubated (2 x 106) with 20-, 30-, and 40-mM doses of ethanol for 6 h. Progesterone was measured in the incubate by RIA. The results showed that, at the 20-mM dose of ethanol, progesterone synthesis was significantly decreased (p < 0.01), at the 30-mM dose level there was a further decrease of 20%. The differences between 30- and 40-mM ethanol dose levels were not significant. To determine the mechanism of ethanol effects on progesterone synthesis, cytotrophoblast cells were preincubated with 30 mM ethanol followed by 10 mul of LDL (10 mul LDL = 80 mug cholesterol) and vice versa. The results showed that ethanol effects on progesterone synthesis was dependent on whether ethanol was added prior to or following the addition of LDL in the medium. If ethanol was added in the medium prior to LDL, progesterone synthesis was decreased significantly (p > 0.01); however, when ethanol was added after the LDL, ethanol had no effect on progesterone synthesis. In the experiment where ethanol and LDL were added simultaneously in the medium, ethanol blunted the stimulatory effect of LDL on progesterone synthesis. To determine whether ethanol affects steroid-producing enzymes localized in the cell organelles mitochondria and microsome were isolated and incubated together with LDL (5 mul LDL = 40 mug cholesterol) in the presence of 30 or 40 mM ethanol. Progesterone was isolated, quantitated, and the results showed that ethanol had no affect on progesterone synthesis suggesting that capacity of steroid- producing enzymes was not affected in the presence of ethanol. From these data, we conclude that ethanol decreased progesterone synthesis in the cytotrophoblast cells, and decrease is caused by blocking of substrate (cholesterol) entry into cell organelles.

N2  - This study has investigated the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the qualitative and quantitative ultrastructure of proliferating and differentiated astrocytes in primary culture as well as on the cytochemical activity of several subcellular phosphatase markers, including acid phosphatase, uridine diphosphatase, thiamine pyrophosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase and glucose-6-phosphatase. The astrocytes were obtained from 21-day-fetuses of both control and alcohol-fed rats. Our results show that several cell components, such as mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes, exhibit qualitative and/or quantitative ultrastructural changes during the process of astrocyte maturation. In some cases these morphological changes are accompanied by variations in the cytochemical activity of enzymes located in these and other cell components, suggesting that these enzymes, and therefore the functional state of these organelles, are modulated during astrocyte development. When prenatally exposed to ethanol, both proliferating and differentiated astrocytes showed striking ultrastructural alterations compared with controls, including an increment of lysosomes as well as a decrease in the values of stereological parameters relative to mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Cytochemical analysis of these cells indicates that prenatal exposure to ethanol decreased the activities of all the enzymes tested, except for acid phosphatase, which was increased in both groups of treated astrocytes. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to ethanol could affect astrocytes during development in two different but probably complementary ways: a) by causing a delay in astrocyte maturation and, b) by inducing a direct toxic effect on these cells.
