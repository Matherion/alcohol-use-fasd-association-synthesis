N2  - BACKGROUND: We investigated agreement between selfreported prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and objective meconium alcohol markers to determine the optimal meconium marker and threshold for identifying PAE. METHODS: Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), ethyl glucuronide (EtG), and ethyl sulfate (EtS) were quantified by LC-MS/MS in 0.1 g meconium from infants of Safe Passage Study participants. Detailed PAE information was collected from women with a validated timeline follow-back interview. Because meconium formation begins during weeks 12-20, maternal selfreported drinking at or beyond 19 weeks was our exposure variable. RESULTS: Of 107 women, 33 reported no alcohol consumption in pregnancy, 16 stopped drinking by week 19, and 58 drank beyond 19 weeks (including 45 thirdtrimester drinkers). There was moderate to substantial agreement between self-reported PAE at >19 weeks and meconium EtG >30 ng/g (kappa = 0.57, 95% CI 0.41-0.73). This biomarker and associated cutoff was superior to a 7 FAEE sum >2 nmol/g and all other individual and combination marker cutoffs. With meconium EtG >30 ng/g as the gold standard condition and maternal selfreport at >19 weeks' gestation as the test condition, 82% clinical sensitivity (95% CI 71.6-92.0) and 75% specificity (95% CI 63.2- 86.8) were observed. A significant dose- concentration relationship between self-reported drinks per drinking day and meconium EtG >30 ng/g also was observed (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal alcohol consumption at >19 weeks was better represented by meconium EtG >30 ng/g than currently used FAEE cutoffs.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a complex malformative condition due to the teratogenic effect of alcohol consumed during pregnancy. Several epidemiological studies have shown that maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is the most common preventable cause of mental retardation in childhood. The effects of alcohol on the fetus range from abortion to a spectrum of clinical manifestations called FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders) that include partial FAS (PFAS), neonatal alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (ARND) up to the most severe disease defined as FAS.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol affects the expression and function of glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors in diverse brain regions. The present study was undertaken to fill a current gap in knowledge regarding the regional specificity of ethanol-related alterations in glutamatergic receptors in the frontal cortex. We quantified subregional expression and function of glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors (AMPARs, NMDARs, GluN2B-containing NMDARs, mGluR1s, and mGluR5s) by radioligand binding in the agranular insular cortex (AID), lateral orbital area (LO), prelimbic cortex (PrL) and primary motor cortex (M1) of adult rats exposed to moderate levels of ethanol during prenatal development. Increased expression of GluN2B-containing NMDARs was observed in AID of ethanol-exposed rats compared to modest reductions in other regions. We subsequently performed slice electrophysiology measurements in a whole-cell patch-clamp preparation to quantify the sensitivity of evoked NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of AID to the GluN2B negative allosteric modulator ifenprodil. Consistent with increased GluN2B expression, ifenprodil caused a greater reduction in NMDAR-mediated EPSCs from prenatal alcohol-exposed rats than saccharin-exposed control animals. No alterations in AMPAR-mediated EPSCs or the ratio of AMPARs/NMDARs were observed. Together, these data indicate that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure has a significant and lasting impact on GluN2B-containing receptors in AID, which could help to explain ethanol-related alterations in learning and behaviors that depend on this region.

N2  - Background: Chronic alcohol exposure alters the function of alveolar macrophages (AM), impairing immune defenses in both adult and neonatal lungs. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are biological markers of prenatal alcohol exposure in newborns. FAEEs contribute to alcohol-induced mitochondrial (MT) damage in multiple organs. We hypothesized that in utero ethanol exposure would increase FAEEs in the neonatal lung and that direct exposure of neonatal AM to FAEEs would contribute to MT injury and cellular dysfunction. Methods: FAEEs were measured in neonatal guinea pig lungs after +/- in utero ethanol exposure via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The NR8383 cell line and freshly isolated neonatal guinea pig AM were exposed to ethyl oleate (EO) in vitro. MT membrane potential, MT reactive oxygen species generation (mROS), phagocytosis, and apoptosis were evaluated after exposure to EO +/- the MT-specific antioxidant mito-TEMPO (mitoT) or +/- the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Whole lung FAEEs were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Cellular results were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls Method for post hoc comparisons. Results: In utero ethanol significantly increased ethyl linoleate and the combinations of ethyl oleate + linoleate + linolenate (OLL), and OLL + stearate in the neonatal lung. In vitro EO caused significant MT dysfunction in both NR8383 and primary neonatal AM, as indicated by increased mROS and loss of MT membrane potential. Impaired phagocytosis and apoptosis were significantly increased in both the cell line and primary AM after EO exposure. MitoT conferred significant but only partial protection against EO-induced MT injury, as did caspase inhibition with Z-VAD-FMK. Conclusions: In utero ethanol exposure increased FAEEs in the neonatal guinea pig lung. Direct exposure to the FAEE EO significantly contributed to AM dysfunction, in part via oxidant injury to the MT and in part via secondary apoptosis.

N2  - Objectives Classical eyeblink conditioning (EBC), an elemental form of learning, is among the most sensitive indicators of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The cerebellum plays a key role in maintaining timed movements with millisecond accuracy required for EBC. Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to identify cerebellar regions that mediate timing in healthy controls and the degree to which these areas are also recruited in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Experimental design fMRI data were acquired during an auditory rhythmic/non-rhythmic finger tapping task. We present results for 17 children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS, 17 heavily exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children and 16 non- or minimally exposed controls. Principal observations Controls showed greater cerebellar blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation in right crus I, vermis IV-VI, and right lobule VI during rhythmic than non-rhythmic finger tapping. The alcohol-exposed children showed smaller activation increases during rhythmic tapping in right crus I than the control children and the most severely affected children with either FAS or PFAS showed smaller increases in vermis IV-V. Higher levels of maternal alcohol intake per occasion during pregnancy were associated with reduced activation increases during rhythmic tapping in all four regions associated with rhythmic tapping in controls. Conclusions The four cerebellar areas activated by the controls more during rhythmic than non-rhythmic tapping have been implicated in the production of timed responses in several previous studies. These data provide evidence linking binge-like drinking during pregnancy to poorer function in cerebellar regions involved in timing and somatosensory processing needed for complex tasks requiring precise timing.

N2  - Purpose: To estimate whether low-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with selected birth outcomes. Methods: Low-to-moderate prenatal alcohol drinking and effects on low birthweight, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, and selected neonatal outcomes were evaluated among 4496 women and singleton infants. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, controlling for confounding variables. Results: Early pregnancy drinking was associated with reduced odds of low birthweight, OR, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.46-0.96) and birth length less than 10th percentile, OR, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.56-0.97). Drinking during the first 3months showed lower odds for birth length and head circumference less than 10th percentile, OR, 0.56 (95% CI, 0.36-0.87) and OR, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.50-0.96), respectively. Third trimester drinking was associated with lower odds for low birthweight, OR, 0.56 (95% CI, 0.34-0.94) and preterm delivery, OR, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.42-0.87). Conclusions: Our results suggest low-to-moderate alcohol exposure during early and late gestation is not associated with increased risk of low birthweight, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, and most selected perinatal outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Risky drinking among Russian women constitutes a significant risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP). Russian women report that obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physicians are the most important source of information about alcohol consumption during pregnancy and developing effective prevention interventions by OB/GYNs is indicated. This is the first study focused on implementation of an AEP prevention intervention at women's clinics in Russia., METHOD: The paper describes the intervention protocol and addresses questions about the feasibility of a brief FASD prevention intervention delivered by OB/GYNs at women's clinics in Russia. Brief physician intervention guidelines and two evidence-based FASD prevention interventions were utilized to design a brief dual-focused physician intervention (DFBPI) appropriate to Russian OB/GYN care. The questions answered were whether trained OB/GYN physicians could deliver DFBPI during women's routine clinic visits, whether they maintained skills over time in clinical settings, and which specific intervention components were better maintained. Data were collected as part of a larger study aimed at evaluating effectiveness of DFBPI in reducing AEP risk in non-pregnant women. Methods of monitoring the intervention delivery included fidelity check lists (FCL) with the key components of the intervention completed by physicians and patients and live and audio taped observations of intervention sessions. Physicians (N = 23) and women (N = 372) independently completed FCL, and 78 audiotapes were coded., RESULTS: The differences between women's and physicians' reports on individual items were not significant. Although the majority of physician and patient reports were consistent (N = 305), a discrepancy existed between the reports in 57 cases. Women reported more intervention components missing compared to physicians (p < 0.001). Discussing barriers was the most difficult component for physicians to implement, and OB/GYN demonstrated difficulties in discussing contraception methods., CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the feasibility of the DFBPI in Russia. OB/GYN physicians trained in the DFBPI, monitored, and supported were able to implement and maintain skills during the study. In addition to the alcohol focus, DFBPI training needs to have a sufficient component to improve physicians' skills in discussing contraception use.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and associated behavioral impairments that may be linked to disruptions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Social and physical enrichment has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach toward reversing behavioral deficits associated with FASD and is also a potent stimulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In the present study, we utilized a genetic fate mapping approach in nestin-CreER(T2)/YFP bitransgenic mice to identify the stage-specific impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on the stepwise maturation of adult hippocampal progenitors. Using a limited alcohol access "drinking-in-the-dark" model of FASD, we confirm previous findings that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure has no effect on adult neurogenesis under standard housing conditions, but abolishes the neurogenic response to enriched environment (EE). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this effect is primarily due to failed EE-mediated survival of postmitotic neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that the neurogenic deficit is associated with impaired spatial pattern recognition, as demonstrated by delayed learning of FASD-EE mice in an A-B contextual discrimination task. These results identify a potential maturational stage-specific mechanism(s) underlying impaired neurogenic function in a preclinical model of FASD, and provide a basis for testing regulatory pathways in this model through conditional and inducible manipulation of gene expression in the adult hippocampal progenitor population.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study assesses factors that contribute to alcohol consumption during pregnancy and identifies potential intervention strategies to reduce consumption., METHODS: The study sample includes 142 pregnant women who attended a public hospital for prenatal health care in Perth, Western Australia. All participants returned a self-completion survey., RESULTS: Women who discontinued drinking during pregnancy were significantly more likely to be engaged in full time home duties and had completed less formal education. Women who continued to drink were more likely to have drunk in previous pregnancies and during the preconception period. Nearly 40% of high risk women reported a negative comment in response to their drinking. One-third of women in the risky group were advised by a health professional not to drink alcohol. Women were most likely to drink in their own home or at the home of a friend., CONCLUSIONS: Participatory research with women who drink while pregnant can assist in identifying potential intervention strategies that have resonance with this group and therefore more potential for creating behaviour change. Implications. The World Health Organization recognises, and has done for over 10 years, that alcohol use during pregnancy which results in Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is the leading cause of environmental-related birth defects and mental retardation in the Western world.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with alterations in numerous physiological systems, including the stress and immune systems. We have previously shown that PAE increases the course and severity of arthritis in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) model. While the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully known, changes in neural gene expression are emerging as important factors in the etiology of PAE effects. As the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) play key roles in neuroimmune function, PAE-induced alterations to their transcriptome may underlie abnormal steady-state functions and responses to immune challenge. This study examined brains from adult PAE and control females from our recent AA study to determine whether PAE causes long-term alterations in gene expression and whether these mediate the altered severity and course of arthritis in PAE females. Methods: Adult females from PAE, pair-fed (PF), and ad libitum-fed control (C) groups were injected with either saline or complete Freund's adjuvant. Animals were terminated at the peak of inflammation or during resolution (Days 16 and 39 postinjection, respectively); cohorts of saline-injected PAE, PF, and C females were terminated in parallel. Gene expression was analyzed in the PFC and HPC using whole-genome mRNA expression microarrays. Results: Significant changes in gene expression in both the PFC and HPC were found in PAE compared to controls in response to ethanol exposure alone (saline-injected females), including genes involved in neurodevelopment, apoptosis, and energy metabolism. Moreover, in response to inflammation (adjuvant-injected females), PAE animals showed unique expression patterns, while failing to exhibit the activation of genes and regulators involved in the immune response observed in control and pair-fed animals. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that PAE affects neuroimmune function at the level of gene expression, demonstrating long-term effects of PAE on the central nervous system response under steady-state conditions and following an inflammatory insult.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to assess the rate of misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among a population of foster and adopted youth referred to a children's mental health center. METHODS: Data were collected from a sample of 547 children who underwent a comprehensive multidisciplinary diagnostic evaluation. Utilizing current diagnostic criteria, children were diagnosed, as appropriate, with fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, or alcohol-related birth defects. Changes in rates of alcohol exposure-related diagnoses and cooccurring mental health disorders pre- and postassessment were analyzed by using McNemar's test for dependent proportions. RESULTS: Among 156 children and adolescents who met criteria for a diagnosis within the fetal alcohol spectrum, 125 had never been diagnosed as affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, a missed diagnosis rate of 80.1%. Of the 31 who had been recognized before referral as affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, 10 children's FASD diagnoses were changed within the spectrum, representing a misdiagnosis rate of 6.4%. The remaining 21 (13.5%) children's diagnoses stayed the same. There also were significant changes in the rate of mental health diagnosis, and learning disorders, communication disorders, and intellectual disability, objective signs of neurocognitive damage, were not recognized in a significant number of children with FASD. CONCLUSIONS: Within this clinical sample, 86.5% of youth with FASD had never been previously diagnosed or had been misdiagnosed. These high rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis have significant implications for intervention and therapeutic services.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which may underlie some of the behavioral and adaptive problems seen in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol show altered basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond 2 years of age. It is also unknown if cortisol levels can be normalized through intervention programs. In this study, we investigated the effects of a physical activity program for children with FASD to determine: 1) if HPA dysregulation persists in school-age children with FASD, and 2) the effect of our program on cortisol levels. Twenty six children (ages 6-14 years) with FASD participated in an 8 week motor skill development program. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 24 children and compared at 4 time points: before, immediately after, 3 months, and 1 year after program completion. Cortisol levels were also compared to 32 control children to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: awakening, after school, and just before bedtime. Cortisol levels were significantly higher in the afternoon and at bedtime in children with FASD with confirmed prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol (alcohol exposure rank 4), compared with Control children or children with FASD with exposure to low or unknown levels of alcohol (alcohol exposure rank 3). The program did not significantly affect cortisol levels in children with FASD as a group. These results provide support for long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the HPA system in humans, which could increase vulnerability to mental health issues and diseases later in life.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters p35, CDK5 and GSK3beta in the medial frontal cortex and hippocampus of adolescent mice

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the number one cause of preventable mental retardation. An estimated 2-5% of children are diagnosed as having a FASD. While it is known that children prenatally exposed to alcohol experience cognitive deficits and a higher incidence of psychiatric illness later in life, the pathways underlying these abnormalities remain uncertain. GSK3beta and CDK5 are protein kinases that are converging points for a vast number of signaling cascades, including those controlling cellular processes critical to learning and memory. We investigated whether levels of GSK3beta and CDK5 are affected by moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), specifically in the hippocampus and medial frontal cortex of the adolescent mouse. In the present work we utilized immunoblotting techniques to demonstrate that moderate PAE increased hippocampal p35 and beta-catenin, and decreased total levels of GSK3beta, while increasing GSK3beta Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation. Interestingly, different alterations were seen in the medial frontal cortex where p35 and CDK5 were decreased and increased total GSK3beta was accompanied by reduced Tyr216 of the enzyme. These results suggest that kinase dysregulation during adolescence might be an important contributing factor to the effects of PAE on hippocampal and medial frontal cortical functioning; and by extension, that global modulation of these kinases may produce differing effects depending on brain region.

N2  - The significant consequences of ethanol use during pregnancy are neurobehavioral abnormalities involving hippocampal and neocortex malfunctions that cause learning and memory deficits collectively named fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are still poorly understood and therefore warrant systematic research. Here, we document novel epigenetic abnormalities in the mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Ethanol treatment of P7 mice, which induces activation of caspase 3, impaired DNA methylation through reduced DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3A) levels. Inhibition of caspase 3 activity, before ethanol treatment, rescued DNMT1, DNMT3A proteins as well as DNA methylation levels. Blockade of histone methyltransferase (G9a) activity or cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1R), prior to ethanol treatment, which, respectively, inhibits or prevents activation of caspase 3, rescued the DNMT1 and DNMT3A proteins and DNA methylation. No reduction of DNMT1 and DNMT3A proteins and DNA methylation was found in P7 CB1R null mice, which exhibit no ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3. Together, these data demonstrate that ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3 impairs DNA methylation through DNMT1 and DNMT3A in the neonatal mouse brain, and such impairments are absent in CB1R null mice. Epigenetic events mediated by DNA methylation may be one of the essential mechanisms of ethanol teratogenesis.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: An overview for pediatric and adolescent care providers
A1  - Senturias Y.S.N.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a term used to describe the spectrum of conditions associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. These are characterized by facial dysmorphia, growth deficits and central nervous system abnormalities. FASDs are the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability in the United States and have high financial costs. Therefore, efforts at prevention are paramount. When an individual with an FASD goes undiagnosed and when appropriate interventions are not instituted, secondary disabilities such as substance abuse, school dropout, and criminal involvement are common with corresponding suffering endured by both the affected individual and the family. The diagnostic process opens up access to existing tools and resources, including the new American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) FASD algorithm for the evaluation of FASDs, the new AAP FASD toolkit and evidence-based interventions specific to FASDs. Pediatric and adolescent clinicians are challenged to participate in the continuum of care from FASD prevention to identification, diagnosis, and management, including provision of supportive services for families in order for clinicians to make a difference in this 100% preventable disorder. © 2014 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Background: Detection of in-pregnancy maternal risk alcohol drinking is an essential first step in preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and the widely used T-ACE screen was developed for that purpose. We recently reported that increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point from 2 to 3 doubled specificity of detecting risk drinking in pregnancy and identified 4-year-old children with neurobehavioral effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: In this study, the TACER-3 was further validated in another prospectively identified high-risk urban cohort. Women were categorized as follows: (i) Not At-Risk Group (negative on T-ACE and TACER-3); (ii) At-Risk Group (positive on T-ACE and TACER-3); and (iii) Change Risk Group (positive on T-ACE but negative on TACER-3). Results: The TACER-3 total score cut-point of 3 yielded fewer "false positives" than the T-ACE cut-point of 2. Based on relative risk scores, women in the TACER-3-positive At-Risk Group were more likely to drink alcohol during pregnancy than women in the Change Risk Group. In contrast, women in the Not At-Risk Group were largely not different in their drinking from women in the Change Risk Group. The largest increases in relative risk of the At-Risk Group compared to the Change Risk Group were for the amount of drinking per day across pregnancy (RR = 11.4) and for the amount of drinking per drinking day at the first prenatal visit (RR = 12.7). For both of these measures, the relative risk of at-risk alcohol consumption in the At-Risk Group was over >10 times that of the Change Risk Group. Conclusions: Thus, the TACER-3 was more effective at selectively identifying women drinking at fetal risk levels than the original T-ACE. The TACER-3 allows for more efficient use of healthcare provider time in directing targeted clinical interventions with pregnant women identified as drinking at fetal risk levels. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are associated with adaptive behavior deficits. This study examined the interaction between these 2 factors on parent ratings of adaptive behavior. Methods: As part of a multisite study, primary caregivers of 317 children (8 to 16 years, M = 12.38) completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition (VABS-II). Four groups of subjects were included: children with prenatal alcohol exposure with ADHD (AE+, n = 82), children with prenatal alcohol exposure without ADHD (AE-, n = 34), children with ADHD (ADHD, n = 71), and control children (CON, n = 130). VABS-II domain scores (Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization) were examined using separate 2 (Alcohol Exposure [AE]) x 2 (ADHD diagnosis) between-subjects analyses of covariance. Results: There were significant main effects of AE (p < 0.001) and ADHD (p < 0.001) on all VABS-II domains; alcohol-exposed children had lower scores than children without prenatal alcohol exposure and children with ADHD had lower scores than those without ADHD. There was a significant AE x ADHD interaction effect for Communication, F(1, 308) = 7.49, p = 0.007, partial 2 = 0.024, but not Daily Living Skills or Socialization domains (ps > 0.27). Follow-up analyses in the Communication domain indicated the effects of ADHD were stronger in comparison subjects (ADHD vs. CON) than exposed subjects (AE+ vs. AE-), and the effects of alcohol exposure were stronger in subjects without ADHD (AE- vs. CON) than in subjects with ADHD (AE+ vs. ADHD). Conclusion: As found previously, both prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD increase adaptive behavior deficits in all domains. However, these 2 factors interact to cause the greatest impairment in children with both prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD for communication abilities. These results further demonstrate the deleterious effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and broaden our understanding of how ADHD exacerbates behavioral outcomes in this population. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Plasma or circulating miRNAs (cirmiRNAs) have potential diagnostic value as biomarkers for a range of diseases. Based on observations that ethanol (EtOH) altered intracellular miRNAs during development, we tested the hypothesis that plasma miRNAs were biomarkers for maternal alcohol exposure, and for past in utero exposure, in the neonate. Methods: Pregnant sheep were exposed to a binge model of EtOH consumption resulting in an average peak blood alcohol content of 243 mg/dl, for a third-trimester-equivalent period from gestational day 4 (GD4) to GD132. MiRNA profiles were assessed by quantitative PCR analysis in plasma, erythrocyte, and leukocytes obtained from nonpregnant ewes, and plasma from pregnant ewes 24 hours following the last binge EtOH episode, and from newborn lambs, at birth on ~GD147. Results: Pregnant ewe and newborn lamb cirmiRNA profiles were similar to each other and different from nonpregnant female plasma, erythrocyte, or leukocyte miRNAs. Significant changes in cirmiRNA profiles were observed in the EtOH-exposed ewe and, at birth, in the in utero, EtOH-exposed lamb. CirmiRNAs including miR-9, -15b, -19b, and -20a were sensitive and specific measures of EtOH exposure in both pregnant ewe and newborn lamb. Additionally, EtOH exposure altered guide-to-passenger strand cirmiRNA ratios in the pregnant ewe, but not in the lamb. Conclusions: Shared profiles between pregnant dam and neonate suggest possible maternal-fetal miRNA transfer. CirmiRNAs are biomarkers for alcohol exposure during pregnancy, in both mother and neonate, and may constitute an important shared endocrine biomarker that is vulnerable to the maternal environment. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Identifying maternal risk factors associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: a systematic review
A1  - Esper L.H.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - To identify the demographic, psychological, and social maternal risk factors associated with the development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). A bibliographic search was conducted in PubMed, SciELO, Lilacs, Web of Knowledge, and PsycINFO. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the studies with case-control design. Articles were selected based on their relevance and presentation of data related to statistical comparisons of at least one or more demographic, psychological, or social maternal risk factors for FASD. 738 references were identified, of which 15 met the criteria to be included in the present review. Mothers of FASD children tend to: be older at the time of birth of the affected child, present lower educational level, have other family relatives with alcohol abuse, have other children with FASD, present a pattern of little prenatal care and a distinguishing pattern of alcohol consumption (alcohol use before and during pregnancy, failure to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy, and frequent episodes of binge drinking). Application of the NOS scale of methodological quality indicated that 8 studies (53 %) met the criterion for selection, 4 (27 %) were suitable for the criterion for comparability and only 4 studies were suitable for the exposition criterion. Mothers of FASD children have a distinctive pattern of drinking and accumulate several social risk factors. Maternal age at birth of the child seems to accentuate the risk. There are, however, few controlled studies that are adequate according to the NOS requirements for methodological quality. Fewer are based on the verification of a theoretical model. Clinicians should be aware of the relevance of preventive assessment of FASD risk mothers.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is responsible for a broad range of brain structural malformations, which can be studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Advanced MRI methods have emerged to characterize brain abnormalities, but the teratogenic effects of alcohol on cortical morphology have received little attention to date. Twenty-four 9-year-old children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (9 with fetal alcohol syndrome, 15 heavy exposed nonsyndromal children) and 16 age-matched controls were studied to assess the effect of alcohol consumption during pregnancy on cortical morphology. An automated method was applied to 3D T1-weighted images to assess cortical gyrification using global and regional sulcal indices and two region-based morphological measurements, mean sulcal depth and fold opening. Increasing levels of alcohol exposure were related to reduced cortical folding complexity, even among children with normal brain size, indicating a reduction of buried cortical surface. Fold opening was the strongest anatomical correlate of prenatal alcohol intake, indicating a widening of sulci in all regions that were examined. These data identify cortical morphology as a suitable marker for further investigation of brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can produce a myriad of deficits. Unfortunately, affected individuals may also be exposed to the stress of an adverse home environment, contributing to deficits of attentional processes that are the hallmark of optimal executive function. Male offspring of ad-libitum-fed Control (Con), Pairfed (PF), and PAE dams were randomly assigned to either a 5-day period of variable chronic mild stress (CMS) or no CMS in adolescence. In adulthood, rats were trained in a non-match to sample task (T-maze), followed by extensive assessment in the five-choice serial reaction time task. Once rats acquired the five-choice serial reaction time task (stable accuracy), they were tested in three challenge conditions: (i) increased sustained attention, (ii) selective attention and, (iii) varying doses of d-amphetamine, an indirect dopamine and norepinephrine agonist. At birth and throughout the study, PAE offspring showed reduced body weight. Moreover, although PAE animals were similar to Con animals in task acquisition, they were progressively less proficient with transitions to shorter stimulus durations (decreased accuracy and increased omissions). Five days of adolescent CMS increased basal corticosterone levels in adolescence and disrupted cognitive performance in adulthood. Further, CMS augmented PAE-related disturbances in acquisition and, to a lesser extent, also disrupted attentional processes in Con and PF animals. Following task acquisition, challenges unmasked persistent attentional difficulties resulting from both PAE and adolescent CMS. In conclusion, PAE, adolescent CMS, and their interaction produced unique behavioural profiles that suggest vulnerability in select neurobiological processes at different stages of development.

N2  - Individuals exposed to alcohol during gestation show higher rates of psychopathologies. The hyperresponsivity to stress induced by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) may be related to this increased rate of psychopathologies, especially because this population is more likely to be exposed to stressful environments throughout life. However, alcohol-induced changes in the overlapping neurocircuitries that underlie stress and the expression of psychopathologies are not fully understood. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the neural activity within central areas known to play key roles in both emotional and stress regulation. Adult male and female offspring from PAE, pair-fed, and ad libitum-fed control conditions were exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS). Following CMS, the neural activity (c-fos mRNA) of the amygdala, ventral hippocampal formation, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) was assessed in response to an acute stress (elevated plus maze). Our results demonstrate that, overall, PAE decreased neural activity within the amygdala and hippocampal formation in males and increased neural activity within the amygdala and mPFC in females. CMS reduced neural activity within the mPFC and PVN in PAE males, but reduced activity in all areas analyzed in control males. By contrast, CMS reduced neural activity in the mPFC in PAE females and had no effects in control females. Furthermore, the constrained principal component analysis revealed that these patterns of neural activity resulted in differential activation of the functional neural networks in males compared to females, indicating sexually dimorphic effects of PAE and CMS. Importantly, the altered networks of brain activation in PAE animals may underlie the hyperresponsivity to stress and increased psychopathologies observed among individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. © 2014 Raineki, Hellemans, Bodnar, Lavigne, Ellis, Woodward and Weinberg.

T1  - Effects of moderate prenatal ethanol exposure and age on social behavior, spatial response perseveration errors and motor behavior
A1  - Savage D.D.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Persistent deficits in social behavior are among the major negative consequences associated with exposure to ethanol during prenatal development. Prior work from our laboratory has linked deficits in social behavior following moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in the rat to functional alterations in the ventrolateral frontal cortex [21]. In addition to social behaviors, the regions comprising the ventrolateral frontal cortex are critical for diverse processes ranging from orofacial motor movements to flexible alteration of behavior in the face of changing consequences. The broader behavioral implications of altered ventrolateral frontal cortex function following moderate PAE have, however, not been examined. In the present study we evaluated the consequences of moderate PAE on social behavior, tongue protrusion, and flexibility in a variant of the Morris water task that required modification of a well-established spatial response. PAE rats displayed deficits in tongue protrusion, reduced flexibility in the spatial domain, increased wrestling, and decreased investigation, indicating that several behaviors associated with ventrolateral frontal cortex function are impaired following moderate PAE. A linear discriminant analysis revealed that measures of wrestling and tongue protrusion provided the best discrimination of PAE rats from saccharin-exposed control rats. We also evaluated all behaviors in young adult (4-5 months) or older (10-11 months) rats to address the persistence of behavioral deficits in adulthood and possible interactions between early ethanol exposure and advancing age. Behavioral deficits in each domain persisted well into adulthood (10-11 months), however, there was no evidence that aging enhances the effects of moderate PAE within the age ranges that were studied.

N2  - South Africa has the highest rate of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the world. While efforts have been made to curb the high rate of FAS, little is known about situational factors that may contribute to alcohol use during pregnancy. In the current paper, we focus on the role of food insecurity and its relationship to alcohol use among pregnant women. Women completed computer-assisted interviews. Generalized linear modeling was used in all analyses. Women attending alcohol-serving establishments in a township in Cape Town, South Africa were recruited for the study. Five hundred sixty women were sampled and 95 women reported being pregnant. High levels of alcohol use were reported among pregnant women: 65 % of women consumed alcohol at least every month and 29 % consumed alcohol as often as two to three times per week. Thirty-four percent of the women reported having six or more drinks per occasion on at least a weekly basis. The majority (87 %) of pregnant women reported experiencing some form of food insecurity (e.g., food unavailable, eating less) in the past month. Alcohol use was significantly associated with food insecurity, even when controlling for relevant demographic variables. Intervention with pregnant women who consume alcohol is urgently needed. Future research should focus on understanding the intersection of food insecurity and alcohol, and how the experience of food insecurity may contribute to greater rates of alcohol use and abuse among pregnant women.

The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to ethanol such that prenatal ethanol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Neuronal loss in the brain is the most devastating consequence and is associated with mental retardation and other behavioral deficits observed in FASD. Since alcohol consumption during pregnancy has not declined, it is imperative to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop effective therapeutic strategies. One cellular mechanism that acts as a protective response for the central nervous system (CNS) is autophagy. Autophagy regulates lysosomal turnover of organelles and proteins within cells, and is involved in cell differentiation, survival, metabolism, and immunity. We have recently shown that ethanol activates autophagy in the developing brain. The autophagic preconditioning alleviates ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis, whereas inhibition of autophagy potentiates ethanol-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exacerbates ethanol-induced neuroapoptosis. The expression of genes encoding proteins required for autophagy in the CNS is developmentally regulated; their levels are much lower during an ethanol-sensitive period than during an ethanol-resistant period. Ethanol may stimulate autophagy through multiple mechanisms; these include induction of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, modulation of MTOR and AMPK signaling, alterations in BCL2 family proteins, and disruption of intracellular calcium (Ca2C) homeostasis. This review discusses the most recent evidence regarding the involvement of autophagy in ethanolmediated neurotoxicity as well as the potential therapeutic approach of targeting autophagic pathways.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a prenatal disease characterized by fetal morphological and neurological abnormalities originating from exposure to alcohol. Although FAS is a well-described pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying its progression are virtually unknown. Moreover, alcohol abuse can affect vitamin metabolism and absorption, although how alcohol impairs such biochemical pathways remains to be elucidated. We employed a variety of systems chemo-biology tools to understand the interplay between ethanol metabolism and vitamins during mouse neurodevelopment. For this purpose, we designed interactomes and employed transcriptomic data analysis approaches to study the neural tissue of Mus musculus exposed to ethanol prenatally and postnatally, simulating conditions that could lead to FAS development at different life stages. Our results showed that FAS can promote early changes in neurotransmitter release and glutamate equilibrium, as well as an abnormal calcium influx that can lead to neuroinflammation and impaired neurodifferentiation, both extensively connected with vitamin action and metabolism. Genes related to retinoic acid, niacin, vitamin D, and folate metabolism were underexpressed during neurodevelopment and appear to contribute to neuroinflammation progression and impaired synapsis. Our results also indicate that genes coding for tubulin, tubulin-associated proteins, synapse plasticity proteins, and proteins related to neurodifferentiation are extensively affected by ethanol exposure. Finally, we developed a molecular model of how ethanol can affect vitamin metabolism and impair neurodevelopment.

N2  - CONCLUSIONS: The lower NAA levels seen in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure may reflect impaired neuronal integrity in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Our finding of lower Cho points to disrupted Cho metabolism of membrane phospholipids, reflecting altered neuropil development with potentially reduced content of dendrites and synapses. The alcohol-related alterations in Glx may suggest a disruption of the glutamate-glutamine cycling involved in glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission., BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to impairment in cerebellar structure and function, including eyeblink conditioning. The deep cerebellar nuclei, which play a critical role in cerebellar-mediated learning, receive extensive inputs from brain stem and cerebellar cortex and provide the point of origin for most of the output fibers to other regions of the brain. We used in vivo (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurochemistry in this important cerebellar region., METHODS: MRS data from the deep cerebellar nuclei were acquired from 37 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 17 non- or minimally exposed controls from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa., RESULTS: Increased maternal alcohol consumption around time of conception was associated with lower N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the deep nuclei (r = -0.33, p < 0.05). Higher levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to lower levels of the choline-containing metabolites (r = -0.37, p < 0.01), glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine (Cho). Alcohol consumption levels both at conception (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and during pregnancy (r = 0.38, p < 0.01) were related to higher levels of glutamate plus glutamine (Glx). All these effects continued to be significant after controlling for potential confounders.

N2  - Background: Maternal risk factors for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in Italy and Mediterranean cultures need clarification, as there are few studies and most are plagued by inaccurate reporting of antenatal alcohol use. Methods: Maternal interviews (n= 905) were carried out in a population-based study of the prevalence and characteristics of FASD in the Lazio region of Italy which provided data for multivariate case control comparisons and multiple correlation models. Results: Case control findings from interviews seven years post-partum indicate that mothers of children with FASD are significantly more likely than randomly-selected controls or community mothers to: be shorter; have higher body mass indexes (BMI); be married to a man with legal problems; report more drinking three months pre-pregnancy; engage in more current drinking and drinking alone and have alcohol problems in her family. Logistic regression analysis of multiple candidate predictors of a FASD diagnosis indicates that alcohol problems in the child's family is the most significant risk factor, making a diagnosis within the continuum of FASD 9 times more likely (95%. C.I.= 1.6 to 50.7). Sequential multiple regression analysis of the child's neuropsychological performance also identifies alcohol problems in the child's family as the only significant maternal risk variable (p< .001) when controlling for other potential risk factors. Conclusions: Underreporting of prenatal alcohol use has been demonstrated among Italian and other Mediterranean antenatal samples, and it was suspected in this sample. Nevertheless, several significant maternal risk factors for FASD have been identified.

N2  - Background: Alcohol exposure has adverse effects on stress physiology and behavioral reactivity. This is suggested to be due, in part, to the effect of alcohol on beta-endorphin (beta-EP)-producing neurons in the hypothalamus. In response to stress, beta-EP normally provides negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and interacts with other neurotransmitter systems in the amygdala to regulate behavior. We examined whether beta-EP neuronal function in the hypothalamus reduces the corticosterone response to acute stress, attenuates anxiety-like behaviors, and modulates alcohol drinking in rats. Methods: To determine whether beta-EP neuronal transplants modulate the stress response, anxiety behavior, and alcohol drinking, we implanted differentiated beta-EP neurons into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus of normal, prenatal alcohol-exposed, and alcohol-preferring (P) and alcohol-non-preferring (NP) rats. We then assessed corticosterone levels in response to acute restraint stress and other markers of stress response in the brain and anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze and open-field assays. Results: We showed that beta-EP neuronal transplants into the PVN reduced the peripheral corticosterone response to acute stress and attenuated anxiety-like behaviors. Similar transplants completely reduced the hypercorticosterone response and elevated anxiety behaviors in prenatal alcohol-exposed adult rats. Moreover, we showed that beta-EP reduced anxiety behavior in P rats with minimal effects on alcohol drinking during and following restraint stress. Conclusions: These data further establish a role of beta-EP neurons in the hypothalamus for regulating physiological stress response and anxiety behavior and resemble a potential novel therapy for treating stress-related psychiatric disorders in prenatal alcohol-exposed children and those genetically predisposed to increased alcohol consumption.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) and believed to be the leading known cause of developmental disabilities in the United States. Our objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) intervention may reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women in Southern California. Methods: Southern California AIAN women of childbearing age who completed a survey including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use were randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former group completed an online SBIRT intervention, and were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. Results: Of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, one-third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior (drinks per week, p < 0.001; frequency of heavy episodic [binge] drinking episodes per 2 weeks, p = 0.017 and risk of AEP p < 0.001 at 6 months postintervention) in the follow-up period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Baseline factors associated with decreased risk of an AEP at follow-up included the perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per week, having reported a greater number of binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, and depression/impaired functionality. Conclusions: Participation in assessment alone may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the web-based SBIRT intervention. Randomization to the SBIRT did not result in a significantly different change in risky drinking behaviors. The importance of perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/functionality may have implications for future interventions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This is the first national study worldwide that objectively measures the rate of heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Meconium analysis of the established biomarker of in utero alcohol exposure, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) is used as an objective measure of heavy alcohol exposure. METHODS: In collaboration with the MIREC study, 2,000 pregnant women were recruited across Canada, with 1,537 consenting to meconium analysis. Meconium samples were analyzed for 4 FAEEs via GC-MS analysis. A positive sample has a total [FAEE] greater than 2 nmol/g. Alcohol self-report was collected via questionnaire and compared to analytical results. The rate of false-positive results increases in a predictable manner with delayed sample collection and is accounted for in incidence rate calculation. RESULTS: Thus far, 690 samples have been processed with 609 eligible for analysis. Analysis results with maternal alcohol consumption self-report data are summarized in the table. The incidence rate of heavy fetal alcohol exposure in Canada was 2.55%. CONCLUSION: This study is the first of its kind to objectively measure the rate of heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Canada. Because 40% of heavily exposed fetuses develop FASD, our study predicts a rate of at least 1% of FASD in Canada, corresponding to 3,750 new cases yearly. (Table Presented).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are thought to be a leading cause of developmental disabilities worldwide. However, data are lacking on alcohol use among pregnant women in many countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of alcohol consumption by pregnant women in Ukraine., METHODS: Cross-sectional screening of pregnant women was conducted in 2 regions of Ukraine during the recruitment phase of an ongoing clinical study that is part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. Women attending a routine prenatal visit at 1 of 2 participating regional centers were asked about alcohol consumption. Quantity and frequency of alcoholic beverages consumed in the month around conception and in the most recent month of pregnancy were measured using a standard interview instrument., RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2012, 11,909 pregnant women were screened on average in the second trimester of pregnancy. Of these, 92.7% reported being ever-drinkers. Among ever-drinkers, 54.8% reported drinking alcohol in the month around conception and 12.9% consumed at least 3 drinks on at least 1 day in that time period. In the most recent month of pregnancy, 46.3% continued to report alcohol use and 9.2% consumed at least 3 drinks per day. Significant predictors of average number of drinks or heavier drinking per day in either time period in pregnancy included lower gravidity, being single, unmarried/living with a partner, or separated, lower maternal education, smoking, younger age at initiation of drinking, and higher score on the TWEAK screening test for harmful drinking., CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the need for education/intervention in women of childbearing age in Ukraine and can help inform targeted interventions for women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The initiation of a standard screening protocol in pregnancy is a step in the right direction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many women drink during pregnancy and lactation despite recommendations to abstain. In animals, alcohol exposure during pregnancy and lactation influences lung and immune development, plausibly increasing risk of asthma and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Studies in humans are few., METHODS: In the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, we examined maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy and lactation in relation to risk of current asthma at 36 months (49,138 children), recurrent LRTIs by 36 months (39,791 children), and current asthma at 7 years (13,253 children). Mothers reported frequency and amount of alcohol intake each trimester and the first 3 months following delivery. We calculated adjusted relative risk (aRR), comparing children of drinkers to nondrinkers, using Generalized Linear Models., RESULTS: A total of 31.8% of mothers consumed alcohol during first trimester, 9.7% during second trimester, and 15.6% during third trimester. Infrequent and low-dose prenatal alcohol exposure showed a modest statistically significant inverse association with current asthma at 36 months (aRRs ~ 0.85). No association was seen with the highest alcohol intakes during the first trimester when alcohol consumption was most common. RRs of maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy with recurrent LRTIs were ~1, with sporadic differences in risk for some metrics of intake, but without any consistent pattern. For current asthma at 7 years, similar inverse associations were seen as with current asthma at 36 months but were not statistically significant. Among children breastfed throughout the first 3 months of life, maternal alcohol intake during this time was not significantly associated with any of the 3 outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: The low levels of alcohol exposure during pregnancy or lactation observed in this cohort were not associated with increased risk of asthma or recurrent LRTIs. The slight inverse associations of infrequent or low-dose prenatal alcohol exposure with asthma may not be causal.

N2  - The cerebellum is a major target of alcohol-induced damage in the developing brain. However, the cerebella of some children are much more seriously affected than others by prenatal alcohol exposure. As a consequence of in utero alcohol exposure, some children have substantial reductions in cerebellar volume and corresponding neurodevelopmental problems, including microencephaly, ataxia, and balance deficits, while other children who were exposed to similar alcohol quantities are spared. One factor that likely plays a key role in determining the impact of alcohol on the fetal cerebellum is genetics. However, no specific gene variant has yet been identified that worsens cerebellar function as a consequence of developmental alcohol exposure. Previous studies have revealed that mice carrying a homozygous mutation of the gene for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS-/- mice) have more severe acute alcohol-induced neuronal losses from the cerebellum than wild type mice. Therefore, the goals of this study were to determine whether alcohol induces more severe cerebellum-based behavioral deficits in nNOS-/- mice than in wild type mice and to determine whether these worsened behavior deficits are associated with worsened cerebellar neuronal losses. nNOS-/- mice and their wild type controls received alcohol (0.0, 2.2, or 4.4. mg/g) daily over postnatal days 4-9. In adulthood, the mice underwent behavioral testing, followed by neuronal quantification. Alcohol caused dose-related deficits in rotarod and balance beam performance in both nNOS-/- and wild type mice. However, the alcohol-induced behavioral deficits were substantially worse in the nNOS-/- mice than in wild type. Likewise, alcohol exposure led to losses of Purkinje cells and cerebellar granule cells in mice of both genotypes, but the cell losses were more severe in the nNOS-/- mice than in wild type. Behavioral performances were correlated with neuronal number in the nNOS-/- mice, but not in wild type. Thus, homozygous mutation of the nNOS gene increases vulnerability to alcohol-induced cerebellar dysfunction and neuronal loss. nNOS is the first gene identified whose mutation worsens alcohol-induced cerebellar behavioral deficits.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and cellular differentiation: A role for polycomb and trithorax group proteins in FAS phenotypes?

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol significantly alters the developmental trajectory of progenitor cells and fundamentally compromises tissue formation (i.e., histogenesis). Emerging research suggests that ethanol can impair mammalian development by interfering with the execution of molecular programs governing differentiation. For example, ethanol exposure disrupts cellular migration, changes cell-cell interactions, and alters growth factor signaling pathways. Additionally, ethanol can alter epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression. Normally, lineage-specific regulatory factors (i.e., transcription factors) establish the transcriptional networks of each new cell type; the cell's identity then is maintained through epigenetic alterations in the way in which the DNA encoding each gene becomes packaged within the chromatin. Ethanol exposure can induce epigenetic changes that do not induce genetic mutations but nonetheless alter the course of fetal development and result in a large array of patterning defects. Two crucial enzyme complexes-the Polycomb and Trithorax proteins-are central to the epigenetic programs controlling the intricate balance between self-renewal and the execution of cellular differentiation, with diametrically opposed functions. Prenatal ethanol exposure may disrupt the functions of these two enzyme complexes, altering a crucial aspect of mammalian differentiation. Characterizing the involvement of Polycomb and Trithorax group complexes in the etiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders will undoubtedly enhance understanding of the role that epigenetic programming plays in this complex disorder.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) is embedded in a matrix of biological, social and ethical processes, making it an important topic for crossdisciplinary social and ethical research. This article reviews different branches of research relevant to understanding how FASD is identified and defined and outlines a framework for future social and ethical research in this area. We outline the character of scientific research into FASD, epidemiological discrepancies between reported patterns of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the incidence of FASD, and the social and ethical considerations that may impact on who is, and is not, diagnosed. We highlight what further research investigating FASD diagnostic processes, as well as the multi-generational impacts of FASD, is needed. Important research priorities are to: 1) enumerate the variety of stakeholders involved in seeking FASD diagnoses; 2) understand the experiences and perspectives of mothers from different backgrounds who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy and their affected children; and 3) collect health histories of maternal alcohol consumption in families to determine the effect of FASD at sub-cultural and cultural levels.

N2  - Background: There is an emerging literature suggesting that structural abnormalities exist in offspring from families selected to have multiple members with alcohol dependence. Structures previously identified by manual tracing techniques include the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, regions involved in emotional processing. Deficits in social cognition have been reported in alcoholic patients with a suggestion that these deficits may be linked to prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. It is possible that the prefrontal cortex may be more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol experienced from either personal or prenatal exposure, or both. Alternatively, familial risk for alcohol dependence may predispose individuals to PFC structural abnormalities. Voxel based morphometry (VBM) is well suited to uncovering whole brain differences between ultra high risk offspring and controls. While most studies have selected families through an alcohol dependent father, understanding the contribution that familial maternal alcoholism has on offspring that is independent of any fetal alcohol exposure effects that the offspring experience provides an opportunity to identify pathophysiologic mechanisms that may be unique to each. With this information targeted interventions could be developed. We hypothesized that decreased gray matter volumes might be seen in the high risk offspring relative to controls in cortical structures and include those associated with facial recognition and social cognition. Also, we hypothesized that comparison of high risk offspring with and without prenatal exposure would reveal new regions unique to exposure. Methods: Structural MRI scans at 3.0 Tesla were obtained from 43 high risk offspring (Mean age 27.4+3.6 years) and 45 low-risk controls (Mean age 24.5+4.1 years). Substance use during pregnancy was obtained from mothers at a time when the young adult participants were studied as children as part of a longitudinal study. Within the high-risk group 16 offspring were exposed to alcohol and 25 were not providing an opportunity to determine which regions differed by familial risk and those due to alcohol exposure. Structural data preprocessing and analysis for this study was performed with the VBM8 toolbox (http://dbm.neuro. uni-jena.de/vbm/) within the SPM8 software (http:// www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) running on MATLAB R2014a (Mathworks). Preprocessing steps in VBM8 toolbox involves bias correction, tissue segmentation, affine registration, normalization, and modulation. Finally, modulated images were smoothed with a full-width half-maximum kernel of 12 mm. Statistical analyses were performed on these smooth images. The resulting maps were thresholded with p<0.001 with a cluster size of 50 voxels. Additionally, regional volumes were calculated using the MarsBaR ROI toolbox (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net) to compare the volume of the specified regions of interests (ROIs) which were further compared in SPSS (version 20). Results: Whole brain analysis revealed clusters in the middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and insula, regions associated with face processing in which high-risk offspring had lesser gray matter than low-risk controls. Also, found were areas of reduced gray matter in the uncus, cuneus, precuneous, claustrum, and caudate. Whole brain analysis was performed within the high risk group to assess the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on gray matter volumes. In this comparison, clusters were identified within the middle frontal, and middle temporal gyri along with the precuneus and anterior cingulate in which exposed offspring had reduced gray matter compared to those that were not exposed. One area showed greater gray matter volume in the exposed offspring, the culmen portion of the right anterior lobe of cerebellum. Region of interest analysis revealed four areas associated with facial processing with lesser gray matter in association with familial risk: the fusiform gyrus (p=0.001), middle temporal gyrus (p=0.024), insula (p=0.042) in the left hemisphere and the orbitofrontal cortex in the right hemisphere (0.040). Analyses using prenatal exposure to alcohol or cigarettes continued to show risk group differences as did analyses in which presence of SUD before the scans was used as a covariate. Correlational analysis between these regions shows highly related structural connectivity with all intercorrelations significant at< 0.001. Conclusions: The fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, insula and orbitofrontal cortex have previously been linked to facial affect perception and social cognition. The present results indicate lesser gray matter volumes in these regions in individuals at ultra high risk for developing alcohol dependence and other substance use disorders. Moreover, the results suggest that the neural underpinnings of social cognitive impairment may be present before these individuals' development substance use disorders.

N2  - Background: Repeated exposure to environmental adversity during development can cause treatment resistant, refractory depression. Although genetic research has revealed that the vulnerability to depression is partially heritable, there is also strong support for the pathogenic role of early environmental adversity in the development and expression of this disorder. Prenatal alcohol exposure has been identified as a potential risk factor for refractory depression and a high rate of comorbid depression has been reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) patients. Stem cell-based regenerative therapy is considered a promising cellular therapeutic approach for some patients with incurable brain diseases. Previously, we found that intravenous neural stem cell (NSC) treatment reversed impaired memory/cognitive function and social interaction behaviors in rats tested using a fetal alcohol exposure-induced psychiatric disorder model. Methods: In this study, we tested this approach to treat the refractory type of depression model rats caused by the combined stress exposures to prenatal ethanol and adolescent corticosterone treatments. Results: We showed that aspects of depressive-like behavior resulting from a forced swim test were reversed by the combined treatment of an antidepressant and the intravenous administration of fetal rat brain derived NSCs with atelocollagen which was used for reducing immune rejection and for potentiate effective migration of administrated cells into the brain. In addition, we showed that alterations of PV-containing GABAergic interneurons and synaptic density protein levels resulting from the combined treatment of antidepressant and NSCs in this model. Conclusions: Our results established a new role for PVcontaining GABAergic interneurons associated with treatment resistant, refractory depression-like behavior in rats and suggested possible new therapeutic options of stem cell therapies for treating refractory types of psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a birth defect due to maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the main somatic stem cells in adults and may contribute to tissue homeostasis and repair in adulthood, we investigated whether early life ethanol exposure affects MSCs and contributes to the propensity for disease onset in later life. Using a rodent model of FAS, we found that ethanol exposure (5.25 g/kg/day) from postnatal days 4 to 9 in rat pups (mimic of human third trimester) caused long-term anomalies in bone marrow-derived MSCs. MSCs isolated from ethanol-exposed animals were prone to neural induction but resistant to osteogenic and adipogenic inductions compared to their age-matched controls. The altered differentiation may contribute to the severe trabecular bone loss seen in ethanol-exposed animals at 3 months of age as well as overt growth retardation. Expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, aP2, and PPAR were substantially inhibited, but BDNF was up-regulated in MSCs isolated from ethanol-exposed 3 month-old animals. Several signaling pathways were distorted in ethanol-exposed MSCs via altered trimethylation at histone 3 lysine 27. These results demonstrate that early life ethanol exposure can have long-term impacts in rat MSCs by both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.

T1  - Embryo transfers between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice: Examination of a maternal effect on ethanol teratogenesis
A1  - Gilliam D.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Genetic factors influence fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) in both humans and animals. Experiments using inbred and selectively bred mouse stocks that controlled for (1) ethanol dose, (2) maternal and fetal blood ethanol levels, and (3) fetal developmental exposure stage, show genotype can affect teratogenic outcome. Other experiments distinguish the teratogenic effects mediated by maternal genotype from those mediated by fetal genotype. One technique to distinguish maternal versus fetal genotype effect is to utilize embryo transfers. This study is the first to examine ethanol teratogenesis - fetal weight deficits and mortality, and digit, kidney, and vertebral malformations - in C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) fetuses that were transferred as blastocysts into B6 and D2 dams. We hypothesized that, following maternal alcohol exposure, B6 and D2 fetuses gestating within B6 mothers, as compared to D2 mothers, will exhibit a higher frequency of malformations. On day 9 of pregnancy, females were intubated (IG) with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or maltose-dextrin (MD). Other females were mated within strain and treated with either ethanol or maltose, or were not exposed to either treatment. Implantation rates were affected by genotype. Results show more B6 embryos implanted into D2 females than B6 females (p < 0.05; 47% vs. 23%, respectively). There was no difference in the percentage of D2 embryos implanting into B6 and D2 females (14 and 16%, respectfully). Litter mortality averaged 24% across all experimental groups. Overall, in utero ethanol exposure reduced mean litter weight compared to maltose treatment (E = 1.01 g; MD = 1.19 g; p < 0.05); but maltose exposed litters with transferred embryos weighed more than similarly treated natural litters (1.30 g vs. 1.11 g; p < 0.05). Approximately 50% of all ethanol exposed B6 fetuses exhibited some malformation (digit, vertebral, and/or kidney) regardless of whether they were transferred into a B6 or D2 female, or were naturally conceived. This suggests the D2 maternal uterine environment did not offer any protection against ethanol teratogenesis for B6 fetuses. One of the questions remaining is the how the B6 uterine environment affects D2 teratogenesis. No definitive conclusions can be drawn because too few viable D2 litters were produced.

N2  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Among the 30,552 parents who responded to a survey, the answers of 19,940 who replied to questions on prenatal exposure to ETS, alcohol consumption, and completed the DuPaul Rating Scale were analyzed. Results revealed that risk of ADHD significantly increased as a result of exposure to alcohol by 1.55 times (95% CI 1.33-1.82), maternal smoking during pregnancy by 2.64 times (95% CI 1.45-4.80), and paternal smoking during pregnancy by 1.17 times (95% CI 1.98-1.39). When the subjects whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy were divided into 4 groups, the prevalence was 1.16 times higher (95% CI 1.02-1.33) in the group exposed to ETS but not alcohol, 1.19 times higher (95% CI 0.91-1.57) in the group exposed to alcohol but not ETS, and 1.58 times higher (95% CI 1.31-1.91) in the group exposed to ETS and alcohol. The differences between the groups were statistically significantly (P<0.0001). This result shows that simultaneous exposure to ETS and alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk of ADHD.

N2  - Background: Studies have reported effects of prenatal marijuana exposure (PME) on cognitive and behavioral outcomes. An earlier publication from this study found that PME predicted early onset of marijuana use and frequency of marijuana use at age 14. No study has reported the effects of PME on marijuana use in young adulthood. This is a developmental period when substance use peaks, and by which, initiation of substance use has largely occurred. Methods: Subjects were from a longitudinal cohort. Women were interviewed initially in their fourth prenatal month and women and their offspring were followed through 22. years. Significant covariates of offspring marijuana use at 22. years were identified and controlled for using ordinal logistic regression. Results: PME predicted marijuana use in the offspring at 22. years after controlling for significant covariates. Prenatal alcohol exposure, offspring race, gender, and age were also significant predictors, but family history of substance abuse or disorder, and sociodemographic and psychological characteristics of the mother and offspring were not. This association was not moderated by gender or race. Conclusions: PME is associated with subsequent marijuana use in young adulthood after considering the effects of other significant factors. These findings have important implications for public health given the recent trend toward legitimization of marijuana use.

N2  - Objectives To estimate incidence and prevalence of FASD by sex and age in Alberta, Canada., Methods We included all patients recorded in the Alberta provincial health databases of inpatients, outpatients, and practitioner claims from 2003 to 2012. The number of people with FASD were calculated from available data on FAS (ICD-9 code 760.71; ICD-10 codes Q86.0 and P04.3) and estimated prevalence of FASD among individuals diagnosed with 21 FASD-related conditions (identified by a literature review) for which there are ICD codes, such as learning disability, mental retardation, and nervous system defects (Table 1). Fractions of FASD-related diagnoses that can be attributed to alcohol use during pregnancy were estimated by a systematic review. The incidence was measured as the number of new cases per 1000 births. The prevalence was measured as the number of cases per 1000 population in 2012., Results Annually, 739 to 1884 people were born with FASD in Alberta establishing an incidence of 14.2 to 43.8 per 1000 births, depending on the length of follow-up. There were about 46,000 people living with FASD in Alberta 2012, including 6,000 FAS cases and 40,000 FASD-related cases. The prevalence of FASD was 11.7 (range 8.2 to 15.1) per 1000 population. The incidence and prevalence varied greatly by sex and age group. Generally, male and younger outnumbered female and older., Conclusion This study suggests new incidence and prevalence of FASD, which are higher than what has been commonly used (1%), and its variations among sex and age groups.

N2  - Objectives: Little is known on how the dose and timing of exposure co-influence the cumulative concentration of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium. The objective of the study was to assess the cumulative concentration of FAEEs in meconium as a biomarker of light, moderate, or heavy prenatal alcohol exposure occurring at either first, second, or third trimesters of pregnancy. Methods: History of prenatal alcohol exposure was obtained in the 34th week of gestation from 294 pregnant women. Meconium was collected from their babies within the first 6 to 12 h after birth and examined for the presence of nine FAEEs. Results: No significant differences were identified between the cumulative levels of FAEEs in the meconium from the babies born to abstainers and those born to mothers with history of light-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure during their pregnancy. Conclusions: Light-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure cannot be reliably predicted by the cumulative FAEE concentrations in meconium of exposed babies. A cumulative FAEE level of >10nmol/g would be required to consider that prenatal alcohol exposure during the second to third trimesters occurred at risky levels in the absence of reliable maternal history of ethanol exposure.

N2  - Reductions in brain volumes represent a neurobiological signature of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Less clear is how regional brain tissue reductions differ after normalizing for brain size differences linked with FASD and whether these profiles can predict the degree of prenatal exposure to alcohol. To examine associations of regional brain tissue excesses/deficits with degree of prenatal alcohol exposure and diagnosis with and without correction for overall brain volume, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) methods were applied to structural imaging data from a well-characterized, demographically homogeneous sample of children diagnosed with FASD (n = 39, 9.6-11.0 years) and controls (n = 16, 9.5-11.0 years). Degree of prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated with regionally pervasive brain tissue reductions in: (1) the thalamus, midbrain, and ventromedial frontal lobe, (2) the superior cerebellum and inferior occipital lobe, (3) the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and (4) the precuneus and superior parietal lobule. When overall brain size was factored out of the analysis on a subject-by-subject basis, no regions showed significant associations with alcohol exposure. FASD diagnosis was associated with a similar deformation pattern, but few of the regions survived FDR correction. In data-driven independent component analyses (ICA) regional brain tissue deformations successfully distinguished individuals based on extent of prenatal alcohol exposure and to a lesser degree, diagnosis. The greater sensitivity of the continuous measure of alcohol exposure compared with the categorical diagnosis across diverse brain regions underscores the dose dependence of these effects. The ICA results illustrate that profiles of brain tissue alterations may be a useful indicator of prenatal alcohol exposure when reliable historical data are not available and facial features are not apparent.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a wide range of deficits in executive function that persist throughout life, but little is known about how changes in brain structure relate to cognition in affected individuals. In the current study, we predicted that the rate of white matter volumetric development would be atypical in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) when compared to typically developing children, and that the rate of change in cognitive function would relate to differential white matter development between groups. Data were available for 103 subjects [49 with FASD, 54 controls, age range 6-17, mean age = 11.83] with 153 total observations. Groups were age-matched. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an executive function (EF) battery. Using white matter volumes measured bilaterally for frontal and parietal regions and the corpus callosum, change was predicted by modeling the effects of age, intracranial volume, sex, and interactions with exposure status and EF measures. While both groups showed regional increases in white matter volumes and improvement in cognitive performance over time, there were significant effects of exposure status on age-related relationships between white matter increases and EF measures. Specifically, individuals with FASD consistently showed a positive relationship between improved cognitive function and increased white matter volume over time, while no such relationships were seen in controls. These novel results relating improved cognitive function with increased white matter volume in FASD suggest that better cognitive outcomes could be possible for FASD subjects through interventions that enhance white matter plasticity.

N2  - Background and aims Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with several adverse outcomes for the developing child, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most well-known. In The Netherlands it is recommended not to drink any alcohol while pregnant. Our objective was to describe the prevalence and pattern of alcohol consumption during pregnancy in the Netherlands. Methods In 2007 and 2010 we undertook two nation-wide surveys amongst mothers who brought their infant aged <6 months to a well-baby clinic. Survey-data were weighted for educational attainments to represent national figures. Results In 2007 data were obtained from 2768 and in 2010 from 1448 women. Between 2007 and 2010, the frequency of drinking did not increase, but the amount per occasion did. Overall, 21% of women reported that they had drunk alcohol during pregnancy. Of women who drank alcohol during the first 3 months, 25% reported 1-3 drinking occasions per month; 7% reported weekly intake, and 0.5% reported daily intake of alcohol. Binge drinking (>6 drinks/occasion) while pregnant was reported by 8%. In 2007, 53% had <1, 40% had 1-3, and 7% had >3 drinks/occasion. In 2010 this was respectively 4%, 83%, and 13%. As compared to the first three months, in the last six months of pregnancy alcohol intake was somewhat less. Alcohol consumption in pregnancy was more prevalent amongst older (>35 years of age), higher educated women, and amongst women who reported that they had smoked tobacco products while pregnant (adj. OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.51-2.73). Conclusions Despite current recommendations, in 2007 and 2010, 21% of Dutch women drank alcohol while pregnant.

N2  - Background: Alcohol is detrimental to early development. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) due to maternal alcohol abuse results in a series of developmental abnormalities including cranial facial dysmorphology, ocular anomalies, congenital heart defects, microcephaly and intellectual disabilities. Previous studies have been shown that ethanol exposure causes neural crest (NC) apoptosis and perturbation of neural crest migration. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this report we investigated the fetal effect of alcohol on the process of neural crest development in the Xenopus leavis. Results: Pre-gastrulation exposure of 2-4% alcohol induces apoptosis in Xenopus embryo whereas 1% alcohol specifically impairs neural crest migration without observing discernible apoptosis. Additionally, 1% alcohol treatment considerably increased the phenotype of small head (43.4% +/- 4.4%, total embryo n = 234), and 1.5% and 2.0% dramatically augment the deformation to 81.2% +/- 6.5% (n = 205) and 91.6% +/- 3.0% (n = 235), respectively (P < 0.05). Significant accumulation of Homocysteine was caused by alcohol treatment in embryos and 5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate restores neural crest migration and alleviates homocysteine accumulation, resulting in inhibition of the alcohol-induced neurocristopathies. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that prenatal alcohol exposure causes neural crest cell migration abnormality and 5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate could be beneficial for treating FASD.

N2  - The Western Cape of South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) globally. Reducing alcohol use during pregnancy is a pressing public health priority for this region, but insight into the experiences of women who drink during pregnancy is lacking. Convenience sampling in alcohol-serving venues was used to identify women who were currently pregnant (. n=12) or recently post-partum (. n=12) and reported drinking during the pregnancy period. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between April and August 2013. Interviews explored drinking narratives, with textual data analyzed for themes related to factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy. All but one woman reported her pregnancy as unplanned. The majority sustained or increased drinking after pregnancy recognition, with patterns typically including multiple days of binge drinking per week. Analysis of the textual data revealed five primary factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy: 1) women used alcohol as a strategy to cope with stressors and negative emotions, including those associated with pregnancy; 2) women drank as a way to retain social connection, often during a difficult period of life transition; 3) social norms in women's peer groups supported drinking during pregnancy; 4) women lacked attachment to the pregnancy or were resistant to motherhood; and 5) women were driven physiologically by alcohol addiction. Our data suggest that alcohol-serving settings are important sites to identify and target women at risk of drinking during pregnancy. Intervention approaches to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy should include counseling and contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies, mental health and coping interventions targeting pregnant women, peer-based interventions to change norms around perinatal drinking, and treatment for alcohol dependence during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that innovative interventions that go beyond the boundaries of the health care system are urgently needed to address FASD in this region.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure results in a range of deficits, including both volumetric and functional changes in brain regions involved in response inhibition such as the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The current study examined blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response during a stop signal task in adolescents (ages 13-16. y) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, n=. 21) and controls (CON, n=. 21). Task performance was measured using percent correct inhibits during three difficulty conditions: easy, medium, and hard. Group differences in BOLD response relative to baseline motor responding were examined across all inhibition trials and for each difficulty condition separately. The contrast between hard and easy trials was analyzed to determine whether increasing task difficulty affected BOLD response. Groups had similar task performance and demographic characteristics, except for full scale IQ scores (AE. <. CON). The AE group demonstrated greater BOLD response in frontal, sensorimotor, striatal, and cingulate regions relative to controls, especially as task difficulty increased. When contrasting hard vs. easy inhibition trials, the AE group showed greater medial/superior frontal and cuneus BOLD response than controls. Results were unchanged after demographics and FAS diagnosis were statistically controlled. This was the first fMRI study to utilize a stop signal task, isolating fronto-striatal functioning, to assess response inhibition and the effects task difficulty in adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure. Results suggest that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts neural function of this circuitry, resulting in immature cognitive processing and motor-association learning and neural compensation during response inhibition.

N2  - In the review the literature data on the effect of alcohol on the developing brain of human and animals are summarized. The information is presented on the neuroimaging, histological, cellular and molecular-genetic disturbances in the brain in fetal alcohol syndrome and following exposure to alcohol during the early postnatal period. The structural developmental abnormalities of the different parts of the brain, disorders of neurogenesis and neuronal apoptosis, changes in metabolism, receptors and secondary signals system of neurons are described. Prenatal alcohol exposure causes significant, various long-term disturbances of the brain structures at the organ, tissue, cellular and subcellular level, which may lay in the basis of the observed neurological, behavioral and metal disorders.

N2  - This syndrome is characterized by important brain defects often associated to a decreased expression of the morphogenic protein sonic hedgehog (Shh). The goal of this study was to verify if a FAS could modify the differentiation of hypothalamic neurons producing MCH. Indeed, the expression of this peptide and neurons producing it are dependent of a Shh controlled genetic cascade in the embryo. To address this question, female rats received a 15% ethanol solution to drink during pregnancy and lactation. Higher abortion rate and smaller pups at birth confirmed that descendants were affected by this experimental condition. MCH expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry in embryos taken at E11 and E13, or in pups and young adults born from control and alcoholic mothers. MCH expression level, number of MCH neurons or ratio of MCH sub-populations were not modified by our experimental conditions. However, Shh expression was significantly lover at E11 and we also observed that hindbrain serotonergic neurons were affected as reported in the literature. These findings as well as other data from the literature suggest that protective mechanisms are involved to maintain peptide expressions and differentiation of some specific neuron populations in the ventral diencephalon in surviving embryos exposed to ethanol during pregnancy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Protective effects of the alcohol dehydrogenase-ADH1B*3 allele on attention and behavior problems in adolescents exposed to alcohol during pregnancy

N2  - Alcohol dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of alcohol. Expression of three alleles at the ADH1B locus results in enzymes that differ in turnover rate and affinity for alcohol. The ADH1B*3 allele, which appears to be unique to individuals of African descent, is associated with more rapid alcohol metabolism than the more prevalent ADH1B*1 allele. It has been previously demonstrated that the presence of at least one maternal ADH1B*3 allele confers a protective effect against alcohol teratogenicity in infants and children. This study was conducted to determine whether the presence of the ADH1B*3 allele in the mother or child continues to be protective in alcohol-exposed individuals during adolescence. 186 adolescents and 167 mothers participating in a 14-year follow-up of the Detroit Longitudinal Cohort were genotyped for ADH1B alleles. Behavioral reports were obtained from classroom teachers. Frequencies of the ADH1B*3 allele were 17.6% in the mothers and 21.0% in the adolescents, which are consistent with the 15-20% expected for African Americans. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with increased attention problems and externalizing behaviors in adolescents born to mothers with two ADH1B*1 alleles but not in those whose mothers had at least one ADH1B*3 allele. A similar pattern was seen in relation to the presence or absence of an ADH1B*3 allele in the adolescent, which may have reflected the presence/absence of the maternal variant. This study is the first to demonstrate that the protective effects of the maternal ADH1B*3 allele continue to be evident during adolescence. These persistent individual differences in vulnerability of offspring to the behavioral effects of fetal alcohol exposure are likely attributable to more rapid metabolism of alcohol that the ADH1B*3 variant confers on the mother, leading to a reduction of the peak blood alcohol concentration to which the fetus is exposed during each drinking episode. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause hydrocephalus, through an unknown mechanism. Ethanol also disrupts the homeostasis of vitamin A, an important morphogen in the developing neural tube, particularly in the floor plate which dictates midline formation. Methods: Case report. Results: A two week old baby presented with irritability, episodic vomiting and high intracranial pressure. Ultrasound revealed triventricular hydrocephalus, and a shunt was inserted. Family history and delivery were unremarkable; his mother reported heavy alcohol consumption throughout pregnancy. Head circumference was >95%. Axial and upper limb tone was normal, and lower limb tone was increased. Deep tendon reflexes were brisk, with bilateral positive babinski and clonus in lower limbs. Fundoscopy demonstrated blurring of discs. MRI revealed a non-communicating hydrocephalus secondary to aqueductal stenosis. Extensive metabolic screening was normal, including vitamins E and D; however, vitamin A was extremely low. Maternal vitamin A was normal. Patient did not have any other systemic features of vitamin A deficiency. Conclusions: This is the first case presenting a possible association between prenatal alcohol exposure, vitamin A deficiency and congenital hydrocephalus in humans, which might be mediated through disruption of retinoic acid homeostasis at the floor plate of the developing neural tube.

N2  - Background: It remains uncertain whether exposure to lower doses of alcohol is damaging to the developing fetus. The present study aimed to investigate associations for boys and girls between prenatal exposure to binge drinking and lower doses of alcohol in pregnancy, and parent-reported behavioural and emotional development at age seven. Methods: This study used data from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Associations between cumulated alcohol exposure and binge drinking from full pregnancy and parent scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) measured at age seven were investigated. The SDQ was used as continuous externalising/internalising scores, and as above/below cut-off for the specific scales of hyperactivity/inattention, conduct, emotional and peer problems. Inclusion criteria were information on alcohol exposure from three interviews, SDQ scores at age seven and being born full term (n=37 152). Results: Controlling for relevant confounders, small positive associations were observed between binge drinking and internalising (relative change in mean: 1.04-1.06), externalising scores (relative change in mean: 1.01-1.07), and conduct scores (OR 1.12 to 1.23) for boys. No associations were observed with lower doses of alcohol. Conclusions: Exposure to binge drinking is weakly associated with impaired behavioural and emotional development measured at age seven. Large differences in background characteristics were observed between the groups defined by cumulated alcohol exposure, leaving the interpretations of findings uncertain.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in long-term cognitive and behavioral deficits. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) refers to a range of permanent birth defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, and is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in the US. Studies by autopsy and conventional structural MRI indicate that the midline structures of the brain are particularly vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown that abnormalities in brain white matter especially the corpus callosum are very common in FASD. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel technique that measures tissue's magnetic property. Such magnetic property is affected by tissue microstructure and molecular composition including that of myelin in the white matter. In this work, we studied three major white matter fiber bundles of a mouse model of FASD and compared it to control mice using both QSM and DTI. QSM revealed clear and significant abnormalities in anterior commissure, corpus callosum, and hippocampal commissure, which were likely due to reduced myelination. Our data also suggested that QSM may be even more sensitive than DTI for examining changes due to prenatal alcohol exposure. Although this is a preclinical study, the technique of QSM is readily translatable to human brain.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is the leading cause of preventable neurocognitive deficits in the USA. Women attending STD clinics constitute a population at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). CDC sponsored a demonstration project to evaluate the feasibility of reducing AEP risk in women attending STD clinics, using the CHOICES short intervention. Methods: During 31 months (9/2010 - 3/2013), two STD clinics (in Baltimore and Denver) screened visits for eligible women: heterosexually active, aged 18 - 44, not using effective contraception, and drinking alcohol at high-risk levels (>3 standard drinks on one occasion or >7 in one week), during the last three months. At-risk women were offered the CHOICES intervention, comprising two motivational interviewing-based sessions with a trained interventionist, to explore contraceptive and alcohol use. Free family planning visits were offered to participants. Women were re-interviewed about contraceptive and alcohol use for the preceding 90 days, at three and six months after the first session. Reduced risk for AEP was defined as drinking below high-risk levels, using effective contraception, or both. Results: 17316 female visits were conducted during this time, with 12893 (74%) receiving screening. 1731 (10%) met all eligibility criteria. Of eligible women, 480 (28%) enrolled; 383 of those (80%) received at least one intervention session, and 235 (61%) attended a family planning visit. Of women reached for follow-up, rates of reduced AEP risk at 3 and 6 months were 65% (136/208) and 70% (138/197). Conclusions: Women receiving the intervention had reduced risk for AEP. STD clinics can effectively screen for women at risk for AEP, which is common in this population. The CHOICES brief intervention can motivate behavior change that lowers the risk for AEP. Both clinics are sustaining CHOICES by training public health department personnel outside of the STD clinics to deliver the intervention.

N2  - Objectives: Little is known on how the dose and timing of exposure co-influence the cumulative concentration of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium. The objective of the study was to assess the cumulative concentration of FAEEs in meconium as a biomarker of light, moderate, or heavy prenatal alcohol exposure occurring at either first, second, or third trimesters of pregnancy. Methods: History of prenatal alcohol exposure was obtained in the 34th week of gestation from 294 pregnant women. Meconium was collected from their babies within the first 6 to 12h after birth and examined for the presence of nine FAEEs. Results: No significant differences were identified between the cumulative levels of FAEEs in the meconium from the babies born to abstainers and those born to mothers with history of light-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure during their pregnancy. Conclusions: Light-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure cannot be reliably predicted by the cumulative FAEE concentrations in meconium of exposed babies. A cumulative FAEE level of >10nmol/g would be required to consider that prenatal alcohol exposure during the second to third trimesters occurred at risky levels in the absence of reliable maternal history of ethanol exposure. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - When alcohol is consumed during the prenatal period, it may result in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in the offspring. The aim of this study is to investigate neuroapoptosis on the cerebral cortex of rat pups caused by prenatal alcohol exposure with modified liquid diet and to illuminate the protective effects of betaine and folic acid supplementation. Being alcohol-induced apoptosis indicators on the cerebral cortex of rat pups, cytochrome c, caspase 3 and calpain levels were checked. Cytochrome c level in ethanol+folic acid group (p < 0.05), caspase 3 level in ethanol+betaine+folic acid group (p < 0.01), calpain level in both ethanol+folic acid (p < 0.01) and ethanol+betaine+folic acid groups (p < 0.01) were found to be significantly lower than ethanol group. Cerebral cortex tissues were examined histologically in terms of congestion, edema, necrosis and chromatolysis. While ethanol increased the number of apoptotic cells, it was decreased in ethanol+betaine (p < 0.05) and ethanol+betaine+folic acid groups (p < 0.05). Morphometric examination showed that while the diameter of apoptotic cells increased with ethanol administration (p < 0.01), they were lowered at ethanol+betaine (p < 0.001) and ethanol+betaine+folic acid groups (p < 0.001). As a result, we found that ethanol is capable of triggering cell death in the ethanol-administered rat pups and folic acid and betaine may reduce apoptosis either alone or together.

N2  - In this study, the aim was to investigate the prenatal alcoholinduced oxidative stress on rat cerebral cortex of newborn pups and assess the protective and beneficial effects of Boric acid (BA) supplementation on rats with Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Pregnant rats were divided into three groups as control group, alcohol group and alcohol + boric acid group. As markers of alcohol-induced oxidative stress in newborn pups' cerebral cortex, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were measured. Although MDA levels in alcohol-administered group was significantly increased compared to control group (p < 0.05), its level in the alcohol + boric acid group was shown to significantly decrease compared to alcohol group (p < 0.01). CAT activity of alcohol + boric acid group was found statistically higher than the alcohol group (p < 0.05). GPx activity in the alcohol group was decreased compared to control group (p < 0.05). As a result, we found that alcohol was capable of triggering damage to membranes on cerebral cortex of rat pups and BA could be influential on antioxidant mechanisms resulting from prenatal alcohol.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Aim There are alarming rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in the Kimberley region of Western Australia despite numerous international studies demonstrating the links between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and FASD. The aim of this research was to help determine factors that may be associated with correct knowledge about safe drinking practices during pregnancy, with these factors used to help inform future interventions. Method Ninety-nine residents (40 males, 59 females, 39% of which self-identified as Indigenous) from the Kimberley region (Broome and smaller remote communities) completed a survey examining knowledge of currently recommended safe drinking practices during pregnancy and knowledge of the outcomes for children with FASD over a period of approximately 2 months. Results The results revealed that education level (i.e. not completing high school through to completing university) is the biggest predictor (beta = 0.44, P < 0.01) of knowledge of safe drinking practices during pregnancy, and having heard of FASD (beta = 0.67, P < 0.001) was the biggest predictor of knowledge of outcomes for children with FASD. Other variables such as age, sex, Indigenous status and income level were not as important. Conclusions These findings suggest that early education regarding the consequences of alcohol consumption for women of childbearing age should be paramount in this or similar communities. Suggestions for targeted interventions are discussed in light of these findings. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption inflicts a multitude of phenotypic consequences that range from undetectable changes to severe dysmorphology. Using tightly controlled murine studies that deliver precise amounts of alcohol at discrete developmental stages, our group and other labs demonstrated in prior studies that the C57BL/6 and DBA/2 inbred mouse strains display differential susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of alcohol. Since the phenotypic diversity extends beyond the amount, dosage and timing of alcohol exposure, it is likely that an individual's genetic background contributes to the phenotypic spectrum. To identify the genomic signatures associated with these observed differences in alcohol-induced dysmorphology, we conducted a microarray-based transcriptome study that also interrogated the genomic signatures between these two lines based on genetic background and alcohol exposure. This approach is called a gene x environment (GxE) analysis; one example of a GxE interaction would be a gene whose expression level increases in C57BL/6, but decreases in DBA/2 embryos, following alcohol exposure. We identified 35 candidate genes exhibiting GxE interactions. To identify cis-acting factors that mediated these interactions, we interrogated the proximal promoters of these 35 candidates and found 241 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 16 promoters. Further investigation indicated that 186 SNVs (15 promoters) are predicted to alter transcription factor binding. In addition, 62 SNVs created, removed or altered the placement of a CpG dinucleotide in 13 of the proximal promoters, 53 of which overlapped putative transcription factor binding sites. These 53 SNVs are also our top candidates for future studies aimed at examining the effects of alcohol on epigenetic gene regulation. © 2014 Lossie, Muir, Lo, Timm, Liu, Gray and Zhou.

N2  - Background and aims: Alcohol drinking during pregnancy poses serious health risks to the unborn child such as prematurity, low or high birthweight, fetal death and fetal alcohol syndrome. However, the effects of maternal ethanol consumption before pregnancy on the abnormal development of fetus and the association with the impaired glucose tolerance of mother are not fully understood. Materials and methods: To this, the 6-week C57BL/6J female mice were fed with 5% ethanol-containing liquid diet for 2 weeks before pregnancy and examined the effects of ethanol pre-exposure on fetal development during a subsequent pregnancy. Results: Here, we found that pregnancy or fertility rates were decreased in ethanol-fed mice, correlated with the delaying of eye formation and the formation of defective toe. Also, birth weight in postnatal 0 day (P0) of ethanol- fed mice was higher than those of pair-fed mice, but thereafter, in P14 and P21, growth retardation appeared in the child of ethanol-fed mice. The macrosomia phenomenon in ethanol-fed mice is strongly associated with the dysregulation of glucose metabolism and triglyceride accumulation in maternal liver during the pregnancy. Gut-derived serotonin (GDS) as well as hepatic inflammatory chemokines and cytokines are also markedly increased in ethanol-fed mice, subsequently followed by the alteration of glucose metabolism in the liver and pancreatic beta-cells. Alcohol intake changed the expression of GDS-response receptors from Gs-GPCR to Gi or Gq-GPCR. The detrimental fetal development and impaired glucose metabolism by maternal pre-exposure to ethanol are strongly attenuated by the injection of 4-methylprazol, an inhibitor of CYP2E1. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that ethanol consumption before pregnancy is a major causing factor for the detrimental fetus development via maternal metabolic disorders, especially on the dysregulation of glucose or insulin metabolism in maternal liver and pancreatic beta-cells.

N2  - Background. Recent reports indicate a decline in rates of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) among Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) infants. Nevertheless, AN/AI infants remain disproportionately impacted by the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods. AN/AI pregnant women in their 3rd trimester completed a questionnaire on demographic data and the amount and frequency of their alcohol consumption in the month prior to conception and during pregnancy. Differences across demographics and trimesters were tested with the Chi-square, Fisher's exact or McNemar's test as appropriate. Results. Of the 125 participants, 56% (n=71) reported no alcohol consumption in the 1st through 3rd trimesters of pregnancy; 30% (n=38) of the 125 participants also reported no alcohol consumption in the month before pregnancy. Of the 43% (n=54) who reported consuming alcohol during pregnancy (1st, 2nd and/or 3rd trimester), most (35%) reported alcohol use only in the 1st trimester. Binge drinking in the 1st or 2nd trimester was reported amongst 20% (n=25) of participants with an additional 18% (n=29) reporting binge drinking in the month prior to pregnancy. Women who reported pre-conception binge drinking were significantly more likely to report binge drinking during their 1st trimester (p<0.0001) and 2nd trimester (p<0.0001). A history of tobacco use (p=0.0403) and cigarette smoking during pregnancy (p<0.0001) were also associated with binge drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion. Among study participants, reported use of alcohol was primarily limited to pre-conception and the 1st trimester, with a dramatic decrease in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Prevention programmes, such as the Alaska FAS Prevention Project, may have contributed to observed decreases in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Additional study and focus on pre-conception, the 1st trimester and binge drinking, as well as tobacco use might augment Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder prevention efforts. © 2013 Burhan A.

N2  - Objective. The Brightening Our Home Fires (BOHF) project was conceptualized as an exploratory project to examine the issue of the prevention of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) from a women's health perspective in the Northwest Territories (NT). While dominant discourse suggests that FASD is preventable by abstention from alcohol during pregnancy, a broader perspective would indicate that alcohol and pregnancy is a far more complex issue, that is, bound in location, economics, social and cultural views of health. This project was prevention focused and a social determinant of health (SDH) perspective informed this research. Methods. The BOHF project was a qualitative research project using a participatory action research framework to examine women's health and healing in the north. The methodology utilized was Photovoice. Women were provided training in digital photography and given cameras to use and keep. The primary research question utilized was: What does health and healing look like for you in your community? Women described their photos, individually or in groups around this central topic. This research was FASD informed, and women participants were aware this was an FASD prevention funded project whose approach focused on a broader context of health and lived experience. Results. This project drew 30 participants from: Yellowknife, Lutsel 'ke, Behchoko and Ulukhaktok. These four different communities across the NT represented Dene and Inuit culture. The qualitative data analysis offered themes of importance to women's health in the north including: land and tradition; housing; poverty; food; family; health, mental health and trauma, and travel. Photovoice provides a non-threatening way to engage in dialogue on complex health and social issues. © 2013 Dorothy Badry and Aileen Wight Felske.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a frequent cause of mental retardation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development defects induced by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unclear. We used normal and Hsf2-deficient mice and cell systems to uncover a pivotal role for heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) in radial neuronal migration defects in the cortex, a hallmark of fetal alcohol exposure. Upon fetal alcohol exposure, HSF2 is essential for the triggering of HSF1 activation, which is accompanied by distinctive post-translational modifications, and HSF2 steers the formation of atypical alcohol-specific HSF1-HSF2 heterocomplexes. This perturbs the in vivo binding of HSF2 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in genes that control neuronal migration in normal conditions, such as p35 or the MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins, such as Dclk1 and Dcx), and alters their expression. In the absence of HSF2, migration defects as well as alterations in gene expression are reduced. Thus, HSF2, as a sensor for alcohol stress in the fetal brain, acts as a mediator of the neuronal migration defects associated with FASD. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Impaired social development is a core deficit of FASD. Severe social impairments persist with age and have a negative impact on multiple aspects of functioning. This review critically evaluates the existing literature on social skill deficits and current interventions for social problems in the FASD population. We hypothesized that social problems manifest differently across stages of development and remain pronounced throughout the life course. Methods: Empirical and review studies were ascertained via a computer-based search of PubMeand Web of Science search engine. Searches included different combinations of a main set of keywords: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, Prenatal Alcohol Exposure, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, social skills, social cognition, intervention, treatment, adaptive behaviour and social behaviour. Archival searches from published review papers were also conducted. Results: Social development including social interactions, adaptive behaviours and social cognition are impaired throughout the lifespan in the FASD population. Neonates and infants show significantly impaired arousal states and atypical or delayed developmental behaviours, while older children experience marked difficulties with interpersonal interactions. In adolescence, social impairments often manifest in delinquent and defiant behaviours that continue into adulthood. By working with the affected individual and the caregiver, successful programs are able to address the unique developmental needs of the FASD population. Although progress is reported in several programs, interventions directly targeting social skills are scarce and none have addressed issues regarding the changing trajectory of social issues with time. Conclusions/ Discussion: Existing literature points to a distinct pattern of problematic social skills that contribute to later secondary disabilities. While early intervention is suggested to prevent compounding problems, the efficacy of current approaches is limited.

N2  - Objectives: The focus of this study is to measure the prevalence of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during pregnancy by meconium fatty-acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) analysis in a population-based setting. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) manifests a continuum of permanent birth defects and neurodevelopmental impairments that originate from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Previous literature found that of the Ugandan women who drank regularly prior to pregnancy, only 18.3% reported abstinence, whereas an astonishing 11.1% increased alcohol use, and 68.3% decreased consumption. Thus, the number of FASD cases in parts of the sub-Saharan Africa is growing, which is a cause for concern due to the socio-economic impact. Methods: Meconium samples were collected from 505 newborns between October-November 2013 at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Each meconium sample was accompanied with a questionnaire containing neonatal/maternal information. FAEEs are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol produced in the fetus are serves as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. FAEE meconium concentrations greater than 2.00 nmol/g are considered indicative of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during the last two trimesters of pregnancy. Samples were frozen and shipped to the Motherisk Laboratory for analysis. FAEEs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantified using deuterated internal standards. Results: Of the 505 samples, 68 have been analyzed by GC/MS to date, where 2 are inconclusive due to it being transitional with stool. The remaining 66 samples did not show heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Meconium FAEE analysis is currently ongoing at Motherisk Laboratory. Conclusions: The identification of specific populations in need of basic epidemiologic research on the prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure is urgently required in order to create awareness and reduce the devastation of FASD. This is the first population-wide study of an entire neonatal population examining fetal alcohol exposure conducted in Uganda.

N2  - The Western Cape of South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) globally. Reducing alcohol use during pregnancy is a pressing public health priority for this region, but insight into the experiences of women who drink during pregnancy is lacking. Convenience sampling in alcohol-serving venues was used to identify women who were currently pregnant (n=12) or recently post-partum (n=12) and reported drinking during the pregnancy period. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between April and August 2013. Interviews explored drinking narratives, with textual data analyzed for themes related to factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy. All but one woman reported her pregnancy as unplanned. The majority sustained or increased drinking after pregnancy recognition, with patterns typically including multiple days of binge drinking per week. Analysis of the textual data revealed five primary factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy: 1) women used alcohol as a strategy to cope with stressors and negative emotions, including those associated with pregnancy; 2) women drank as a way to retain social connection, often during a difficult period of life transition; 3) social norms in women's peer groups supported drinking during pregnancy; 4) women lacked attachment to the pregnancy or were resistant to motherhood; and 5) women were driven physiologically by alcohol addiction. Our data suggest that alcohol-serving settings are important sites to identify and target women at risk of drinking during pregnancy. Intervention approaches to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy should include counseling and contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies, mental health and coping interventions targeting pregnant women, peer-based interventions to change norms around perinatal drinking, and treatment for alcohol dependence during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that innovative interventions that go beyond the boundaries of the health care system are urgently needed to address FASD in this region. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Brain imaging studies suggest that cortical thickness decreases during childhood and adolescence, in concert with underlying structural and synaptic changes required for cognitive maturation and regional specialization of function. Abnormalities of this protracted developmental process may provide key insights into the cognitive and behavioral deficits that emerge in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have demonstrated cortical thickness differences in children and adolescents who were prenatally exposed to alcohol, though all have been cross sectional, limiting conclusions about cortical development with age. In this study, we analyze serially collected T1-weighted MRI from 11 children with FASD and 21 controls, scanned twice each ~2 to 4 years apart. Mixed-models analysis of cortical thickness measurements revealed age-by-group interactions in cortical thinning, with FASD participants undergoing less developmental thinning than controls across many regions of the cortex, particularly in medial frontal and parietal areas. These results provide further longitudinal evidence in humans that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with altered patterns of brain development that persist during childhood and adolescence. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: We previously reported that prenatal alcohol-induced deficits in dentate gyrus (DG) long-term potentiation (LTP) are ameliorated by the histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist ABT-239. ABT-239 did not enhance LTP in control rats, suggesting that the possibility of a heightened H3 receptor-mediated inhibition of LTP in prenatal alcohol-exposed (PAE) offspring. Methods: To further investigate this mechanism, we examined the effect of methimepip, a selective histamine H3 receptor agonist, on DG granule cell responses and LTP in saccharin control and PAE rats. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0 or 5% ethanol solution 4 hours each day throughout gestation. Adult male offspring from these dams were anesthetized with urethane and electrodes implanted into the entorhinal cortical perforant path and the DG. Results: In control offspring, methimepip reduced the coupling of fast excitatory postsynaptic field potentials to population spikes (E-S coupling), the probability of glutamate release, as measured by paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and diminished DG LTP. Similar reductions in E-S coupling and LTP were observed in saline-treated PAE offspring. In contrast to the control group, methimepip did not exacerbate PAE-induced reductions in E-S coupling or LTP. Conclusions: While the effects of methimepip in control offspring were consistent with speculation of a PAE-induced enhancement of H3 receptor-mediated inhibition of E-S coupling and LTP, the absence of an added effect of methimepip in PAE offspring could indicate either an inability to further inhibit these responses with methimepip in PAE rats or the presence of more complex regulatory neural interactions with in vivo recordings in PAE rats. Follow-up studies of H3 receptor-mediated responses in DG slice preparations are under way to provide clearer insights into the role of the H3 receptor regulation of excitatory transmission in PAE rats. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Reductions in brain volumes represent a neurobiological signature of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Less clear is how regional brain tissue reductions differ after normalizing for brain size differences linked with FASD and whether these profiles can predict the degree of prenatal exposure to alcohol. To examine associations of regional brain tissue excesses/deficits with degree of prenatal alcohol exposure and diagnosis with and without correction for overall brain volume, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) methods were applied to structural imaging data from a well-characterized, demographically homogeneous sample of children diagnosed with FASD (n = 39, 9.6-11.0 years) and controls (n = 16, 9.5-11.0 years). Degree of prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated with regionally pervasive brain tissue reductions in: (1) the thalamus, midbrain, and ventromedial frontal lobe, (2) the superior cerebellum and inferior occipital lobe, (3) the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and (4) the precuneus and superior parietal lobule. When overall brain size was factored out of the analysis on a subject-by-subject basis, no regions showed significant associations with alcohol exposure. FASD diagnosis was associated with a similar deformation pattern, but few of the regions survived FDR correction. In data-driven independent component analyses (ICA) regional brain tissue deformations successfully distinguished individuals based on extent of prenatal alcohol exposure and to a lesser degree, diagnosis. The greater sensitivity of the continuous measure of alcohol exposure compared with the categorical diagnosis across diverse brain regions underscores the dose dependence of these effects. The ICA results illustrate that profiles of brain tissue alterations may be a useful indicator of prenatal alcohol exposure when reliable historical data are not available and facial features are not apparent. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gross motor (GM) deficits are often reported in children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), but their prevalence and the domains affected are not clear. The objective of this review was to characterize GM impairment in children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or "moderate" to "heavy " maternal alcohol intake. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted. Medline, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, PEDro, and Google Scholar databases were searched. Published observational studies including children aged 0 to <18 years with (1) an FASD diagnosis or moderate to heavy PAE, or a mother with confirmed alcohol dependency or binge drinking during pregnancy, and (2) GM outcomes obtained by using a standardized assessment tool. Data were extracted regarding participants, exposure, diagnosis, and outcomes by using a standardized protocol. Methodological quality was evaluated by using Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. RESULTS: The search recovered 2881 articles of which 14 met the systematic review inclusion criteria. The subjects' mean age ranged from 3 days to 13 years. Study limitations included failure to report cutoffs for impairment, nonstandardized reporting of PAE, and small sample sizes. The meta-analysis pooled results (n = 10) revealed a significant association between a diagnosis of FASD or moderate to heavy PAE and GM impairment (odds ratio: 2.9; 95% confidence interval: 2.1-4.0). GM deficits were found in balance, coordination, and ball skills. There was insufficient data to determine prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The significant results suggest evaluation of GM proficiency should be a standard component of multidisciplinary FASD diagnostic services.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters expression of neurogenesis-related genes in an ex vivo cell culture model

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to long-lasting changes in functional and genetic programs of the brain, which may underlie behavioral alterations seen in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Aberrant fetal programming during gestational alcohol exposure is a possible mechanism by which alcohol imparts teratogenic effects on the brain; however, current methods used to investigate the effects of alcohol on development often rely on either direct application of alcohol in vitro or acute high doses in vivo. In this study, we used our established moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) model, resulting in maternal blood alcohol content of approximately 20 mM, and subsequent ex vivo cell culture to assess expression of genes related to neurogenesis. Proliferating and differentiating neural progenitor cell culture conditions were established from telencephalic tissue derived from embryonic day (E) 15-17 tissue exposed to alcohol via maternal drinking throughout pregnancy. Gene expression analysis on mRNA derived in vitro was performed using a microarray, and quantitative PCR was conducted for genes to validate the microarray. Student's t tests were performed for statistical comparison of each exposure under each culture condition using a 95% confidence interval. Eleven percent of genes on the array had significantly altered mRNA expression in the prenatal alcohol-exposed neural progenitor culture under proliferating conditions. These include reduced expression of Adora2a, Cxcl1, Dlg4, Hes1, Nptx1, and Vegfa and increased expression of Fgf13, Ndn, and Sox3; bioinformatics analysis indicated that these genes are involved in cell growth and proliferation. Decreased levels of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a were also found under proliferating conditions. Under differentiating conditions, 7.3% of genes had decreased mRNA expression; these include Cdk5rap3, Gdnf, Hey2, Heyl, Pard6b, and Ptn, which are associated with survival and differentiation as indicated by bioinformatics analysis. This study is the first to use chronic low to moderate PAE, to more accurately reflect maternal alcohol consumption, and subsequent neural progenitor cell culture to demonstrate that PAE throughout gestation alters expression of genes involved in neural development and embryonic neurogenesis. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can have detrimental impacts on the developing hippocampus, which can lead to deficits in learning and memory function. Although high levels of alcohol exposure can lead to severe deficits, there is a lack of research examining the effects of low levels of exposure. This study used a rat model to determine if prenatal exposure to chronic low dose ethanol would result in deficits in learning and memory performance and if this was associated with morphological changes within the hippocampus. Sprague Dawley rats were fed a liquid diet containing 6% (vol/vol) ethanol (EtOH) or an isocaloric control diet throughout gestation. Male and Female offspring underwent behavioural testing at 8 (Adult) or 15 months (Aged) of age. Brains from these animals were collected for stereological analysis of pyramidal neuron number and dendritic morphology within the CA1 and CA3 regions of the dorsal hippocampus. Prenatal ethanol exposed animals did not differ in spatial learning or memory performance in the Morris water maze or Y maze tasks compared to Control offspring. There was no effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on pyramidal cell number or density within the dorsal hippocampus. Overall, this study indicates that chronic low dose prenatal ethanol exposure in this model does not have long term detrimental effects on pyramidal cells within the dorsal hippocampus or impair spatial learning and memory performance. © 2014 Cullen et al.

N2  - Objectives: Epidemiological studies have raised concerns about the reproductive consequences of in utero exposure to alcohol. Maternal lifestyle factors have been associated with altered pubertal development, but the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on male puberty is unknown. Thus, the objective was to explore whether prenatal alcohol exposure alters pubertal development in boys. Setting: Follow-up of a Danish pregnancy cohort. Participants: Sons (N=2522) of women who were enrolled in a Danish pregnancy cohort between 1984 and 1987. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Indicators of pubertal development, assessed by age at first nocturnal emission, voice break, acne and regular shaving. Results: We found a tendency towards a later age at first nocturnal emission and voice break following in utero exposure to binge drinking. Boys exposed to >5 binge drinking episodes during pregnancy experienced their first nocturnal emission 7.3 months (95% CI -2.8 to 17.4) later and voice break 4.9 months (95% CI -0.6 to 10.4) later than the unexposed boys. Results for average weekly alcohol consumption were in the same direction, but differences were smaller and not statistically significant. Conclusions: We found no strong support for the hypothesis that in utero exposure to weekly alcohol consumption is a risk factor for altered pubertal development, but a tendency towards delayed pubertal development among boys exposed to binge drinking during fetal life was observed. Longitudinal studies, with data collected as children go through puberty, are needed to explore this further.

N2  - Background The teratogenic effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy include anomalies of craniofacial structures derived from the cranial neural crest cells. The presence of specific craniofacial anomalies contributes to the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Cleft lip and palate [orofacial clefts (OFCs)], also derived from the cranial neural crest cells, are common congenital anomalies, but their relationship with prenatal alcohol consumption is unknown. Methods To evaluate the association between maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy and the occurrence of OFCs in infants, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of published studies. We examined the associations between any alcohol consumption, binge level drinking, and heavy and moderate levels of consumption vs. no or low levels of consumption. Results After screening 737 publications, we identified 33 studies (23 case-control and 10 cohort studies). There was considerable heterogeneity in individual study design, quality measures and study results. Findings from random effects meta-analyses suggest no relationship between prenatal alcohol consumption and the occurrence of OFCs {pooled odds ratios for any alcohol intake and binge level drinking respectively: cleft lip with or without cleft palate 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86, 1.16] from 18 349 participants in 13 studies, 1.04 [95% CI 0.87, 1.24] [8763 individuals, 4 studies]; cleft palate only 1.05 [95% CI 0.92, 1.21] [21 459 individuals, 17 studies], 0.94 [95% CI 0.74, 1.21] [7730 participants, 4 studies]}. Conclusions While we found no association between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and OFCs in infants, the influence of study design, particularly in relation to alcohol exposure measurement and OFC ascertainment cannot be ignored. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Seizures are observed with a frequency of 3-21% in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, clinical, neuroradiologic, and electroencephalography (EEG) features are poorly described. In this study, 13 patients with FASD and epilepsy or seizures were identified retrospectively from the databases of seven Italian pediatric neurology divisions. Eleven children were affected by epilepsy, and two had at least one documented seizure. Both generalized and focal seizures were observed. EEG showed diffuse or focal epileptic activity; two children developed electric status epilepticus during sleep (ESES). Structural brain anomalies, including polymicrogyria, nodular heterotopia, atrophy, and Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, were discovered in almost 50% of patients. Control of seizures was not difficult to obtain in 11 cases; one patient showed pharmacoresistant epilepsy. EEG and clinical follow-up are recommended in children with FASD and epilepsy, since severe conditions requiring aggressive treatment, such as in ESES, may develop. Neuroradiological evaluation is warranted because several types of brain anomalies could be associated with maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

Previous studies have shown that these growth deficits could be mediated by alcohol-induced acidemia and alterations in amino acid bioavailability. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of third trimester-equivalent maternal binge alcohol exposure and glutamine supplementation as an intervention strategy on fetal growth, hormonal response and bone biomechanics. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to one of four groups: saline control, alcohol (1.75-2.5 g/kg), glutamine (100 mg/kg) or alcohol+glutamine. A chronic weekend binge drinking paradigm from gestational day (GD) 109 to 132 was utilized and animals were euthanized on GD 132 (term ~147). Fetal growth parameters were significantly decreased in the alcohol group compared to the saline control, glutamine and alcohol+glutamine groups. Femoral and tibial diameters and femoral length were significantly decreased in the alcohol group compared to the saline control and alcohol+glutamine groups (p<0.05). Maximum bone breaking force (N) in the alcohol exposed twin fetuses was significantly decreased compared to the alcohol exposed singleton fetuses (Femur, p=0.016; Tibia, p=0.039) and no significant differences were observed between singleton and twin fetuses for all other groups. These results indicate that maternal alcohol exposure negatively affects bone development in twin pregnancies more compared to the singleton pregnancies.Maximum bone breaking force for the twin fetuses was significantly increased in the alcohol+glutamine group compared to the alcohol group (Femur, p=0.020; Tibia, p=0.019). Fetal femoral and tibial ultimate stress (MPa) and tibial elastic modulus (MPa) was significantly increased in the alcohol group compared to all other groups. Micro-computed tomography-derived bone morphometric and densitometry analysis exhibited lower numerical values in the alcohol exposed group compared to the control group, however, no statistical significant effect of treatment group was observed. Alcohol exposure resulted in ~40%reduction in fetal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) compared to the control groups (p<0.001). However, no significant effect of treatment group was observed on the fetal levels of T3, T4 and free T4. These results indicate that maternal alcohol exposure during the third trimester-equivalent period in sheep alters fetal growth and glutamine supplementation could mitigate this effect.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep problems are common among school-aged children with significant prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), yet little is known about sleep in this high-risk population during the crucial developmental window of infancy, when sleep patterns initially consolidate. We aimed to describe sleep in infants with PAE compared to matched non-exposed controls. Methods: Infants from 6-15 months of age with moderate to heavy PAE assessed through standardized report and non-exposed control subjects underwent overnight polysomnography using standard pediatric techniques. Parents completed questionnaires assessing infant sleep habits and psychosocial risk. Appropriate statistical analysis will be performed on the final sample (10 per group). Initial results are reported as mean +/- SD per group. Results: Data for seven infants with PAE (age 10.6 +/- 1.3 months, 43% female) and five control infants (age 10.5 +/- 1.2 months, 60% female) are available now. Infants with PAE had slightly decreased % sleep efficiency (81.7 +/- 8.8 vs 85.6 +/- 2.4), increased %N1 sleep (14.4 +/- 5.9 vs. 9.6 +/- 3.0) and slightly increased % wake after sleep onset (13.6 +/- 8.0 vs. 11.6 +/- 3.3). Respiratory analysis revealed that infants with PAE had higher apnea-hypopnea indices (7.8 +/- 3.7 vs 6.2 +/- 1.7). Oxygen desaturation indices were markedly higher in exposed infants compared to controls (11.5 +/- 12.2 vs 2.6 +/- 2.0), with most desaturations occurring in REM sleep for both groups (REM desaturation indices 23.4 +/- 9.6 vs. 10.5 +/- 5.2). On questionnaires, parents of infants with PAE reported more difficulty putting baby down for sleep, more nighttime awakenings, and fewer daytime naps compared to controls. Conclusion: Infants with PAE have more difficulty maintaining sleep, with increased sleep disordered breathing and more frequent oxygen desaturations particularly in REM sleep. These differences may provide direction to early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in this prevalent clinical population.

N2  - Introduction: Consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) include motor hyperactivity, disrupted sleep and cognitive deficits. Hypothalamic orexin (ORX)-synthesizing neurons are important for the maintenance of wakefulness and facilitate motor activity but may also contribute to anxiety disorders. We tested whether ORX plays a role in behavioral consequences of prenatal AE in a rat model. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rat pups received 2.625g/kg of alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group). Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). On PD12-14, rats received daily injection of either the ORX-1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (V). On PD16, they were subjected to the homing response (HR) test, an established measure of early learning. Nestseeking trials were repeated up to 10 times until HR acquisition was achieved (4 successful nest findings within 60s in 5 consecutive trials). On PD17, motor activity was monitored for 10min in a novel environment using infrared light beams. All SB/V injections and tests were conducted during the lights-off phase (8-12 PM). Results: The percentage of tests in which HR acquisition was not achieved, the shortest HR latency, and the number of trials needed to reach the shortest latency were all higher, whereas the percentage of successful trials was lower, in AE-V than in S-V rats (p=0.0009-0.03; N=12 and 13/group). In contrast, these measures were not significantly different between AE-SB and S-SB rats (N=13/group). Motor activity in AE-V rats (1003+/-97(SE) beam crossings) was higher than in S-V (578+/-85; p=0.003), S-SB (563+/-110; p=0.007) or AE-SB (654+/-105; p=0.02) rats (S-SB and AE-SB groups not different). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that motor hyperactivity and cognitive deficits following perinatal AE are secondary to increased ORX activity and that these symptoms may be alleviated by systemic antagonism of ORX-1 receptors.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a prenatal disease characterized by fetal morphological and neurological abnormalities originating from exposure to alcohol. Although FAS is a well-described pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying its progression are virtually unknown. Moreover, alcohol abuse can affect vitamin metabolism and absorption, although how alcohol impairs such biochemical pathways remains to be elucidated. We employed a variety of systems chemo-biology tools to understand the interplay between ethanol metabolism and vitamins during mouse neurodevelopment. For this purpose, we designed interactomes and employed transcriptomic data analysis approaches to study the neural tissue of Mus musculus exposed to ethanol prenatally and postnatally, simulating conditions that could lead to FAS development at different life stages. Our results showed that FAS can promote early changes in neurotransmitter release and glutamate equilibrium, as well as an abnormal calcium influx that can lead to neuroinflammation and impaired neurodifferentiation, both extensively connected with vitamin action and metabolism. Genes related to retinoic acid, niacin, vitamin D, and folate metabolism were underexpressed during neurodevelopment and appear to contribute to neuroinflammation progression and impaired synapsis. Our results also indicate that genes coding for tubulin, tubulin-associated proteins, synapse plasticity proteins, and proteins related to neurodifferentiation are extensively affected by ethanol exposure. Finally, we developed a molecular model of how ethanol can affect vitamin metabolism and impair neurodevelopment. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background: Infants exposed to alcohol in the womb are at increased risk of experiencing health problems. However, mixed messages about the consequences of prenatal alcohol consumption have resulted in inconsistent attitudes and practices amongst some healthcare practitioners. Screening and alcohol brief interventions (ABIs) can reduce risky drinking in various clinical settings. Recently, a program of screening and ABIs have been implemented in antenatal care settings in Scotland. However, current evidence suggests that midwives' involvement in alcohol brief interventions activities is patchy. This study explored midwives' attitudes and practices regarding alcohol screening and ABIs in order to understand why they are relatively underutilized in antenatal care settings compared to other clinical settings.Methods: This was a qualitative study, involving semi-structured interviews with 15 midwives and a focus group with a further six midwifery team leaders (21 participants in total) in Scotland. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Midwives were positive about their involvement in the screening and ABI program. However, they were not completely convinced about the purpose and value of the screening and ABIs in antenatal care. In the midst of competing priorities, the program was seen as having a low priority in their workload. Midwives felt that the rapport between them and pregnant women was not sufficiently established at the first antenatal appointment to allow them to discuss alcohol issues appropriately. They reported that many women had already given up drinking or were drinking minimal amounts prior to the first antenatal appointment.Conclusions: Midwives recognised the important role they could play in alcohol intervention activities in antenatal care. As the majority of women stop consuming alcohol in pregnancy, many will not need an ABI. Those who have not stopped are likely to need an ABI, but midwives were concerned that it was this group that they were most likely to alienate by discussing such concerns. Further consideration should be given to pre-pregnancy preventative measures as they are more likely to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies. © 2014 Doi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a wide range of deficits in executive function that persist throughout life, but little is known about how changes in brain structure relate to cognition in affected individuals. In the current study, we predicted that the rate of white matter volumetric development would be atypical in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) when compared to typically developing children, and that the rate of change in cognitive function would relate to differential white matter development between groups. Data were available for 103 subjects [49 with FASD, 54 controls, age range 6-17, mean age = 11.83] with 153 total observations. Groups were age-matched. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an executive function (EF) battery. Using white matter volumes measured bilaterally for frontal and parietal regions and the corpus callosum, change was predicted by modeling the effects of age, intracranial volume, sex, and interactions with exposure status and EF measures. While both groups showed regional increases in white matter volumes and improvement in cognitive performance over time, there were significant effects of exposure status on age-related relationships between white matter increases and EF measures. Specifically, individuals with FASD consistently showed a positive relationship between improved cognitive function and increased white matter volume over time, while no such relationships were seen in controls. These novel results relating improved cognitive function with increased white matter volume in FASD suggest that better cognitive outcomes could be possible for FASD subjects through interventions that enhance white matter plasticity. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure leads to congenital heart abnormal development, its mechanisms are still unknown. Recent reports have associated alcohol exposure with histone H3 acetylation. In the present study, we have performed the experiments to test the hypothesis that histone H3K14 acetylation is the key role in the fetal heart leads to over-expression of cardiac specific genes DHAND and EHAND caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Seventy pregnant C57BL/6 mice were divided randomly into seven groups (n= 10). They were the untreated group, dimethyl sulfoxide group, alcohol exposure group, curcumin treatment group, both alcohol and curcumin treatment group, SAHA treatment group, both alcohol and SAHA treatment group. Fetal mouse hearts were collected on embryonic day 14.5. The changes of HATs activities, the acetylation levels of histone H3K14 (H3K14ac), the expression levels of cardiac specific genes DHAND and EHAND, and structure of chromatin were determined. Our data indicates that curcumin and SAHA significantly reduces and increases the activities of HATs and the levels of histone H3K14ac in fetal hearts, respectively. The expression of DHAND and EHAND is significantly down-regulated and up-regulated in the groups treated with curcumin and SAHA. Furthermore, our results from ChIP assays have shown that the histone H3K14ac connects with the DHAND and EHAND genes are significantly inhibited by curcumin and simulated by SAHA. Our study suggests that prenatal alcohol exposure causes the over-expression of DHAND and EHAND by increasing H3K14ac in mice. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Among the toxins contained in tobacco, nicotine and carbon monoxide are the ones with negative effects on the body of the embryo or the fetus. They pass in the developing body of the baby thanks to placental circulation and causes unwanted effects. Alcohol is a physical and behavioral teratogen which is one of the main causes of mental retardation in the world. Human fetal exposure to alcohol during its embryonic and/or fetal period leads to the birth of a child with fetal alcohol syndrome, which includes: pre-and/or postnatal retard of global growth, characteristic facial dysmorphia, associated malformations, neurologic impairment with microcephaly. Materials & Methods: The research included 205 pregnant women who were hospitalized in "Elena Doamna" Clinical Hospital of Obstetrics- Gynecology Iasi, over a period of time of 5 years (2009-2013). During the research the following have been met: the ethical collaboration with other physicians involved in the management of these cases, a non discriminatory attitude, without unprofessional judgments, the confidentiality of medical documents and personal data, except the statistical data included in the study. The questionnaire filled by the patients aimed the identify the presence of some teratogenic risk factors for the evolution of pregnancy and for the new-born. The share of women who voluntary exposed themselves to a toxic teratogen during pregnancy showed: exposure to nicotine - 25.4%, alcohol - 9.8% and professional toxic - 5.4%. The epidemiological study was a prospective one, case-control type. The data was processed with SPSS 13.0 statistical techniques. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: Age distribution of pregnant women in the study group, shows a higher frequency of pregnant women aged 20-29 (52.2%), those living in towns (78%), married (93.2%). According to the cases studied 55% of the pregnant smokers had premature labour, and the children born by smoking mothers had an APGAR score<7 (26.9%) and also their weight under 2700 g (46.2%). 95% of the children with mother who drank alcohol during pregnancy, had their weight at birth under 2700 g, and 30% of them had an APGAR score57. Premature labour was identified for 36.4% of the patients exposed to toxic emissions. 27.3% of the children whose mothers were exposed to professional toxic substances during pregnancy were under 2700 g at birth and 9.1% of them had an APGAR score57. Conclusions: Complications during pregnancy (hypertension, gestational diabetes, complications), were significantly more in smoking patients (p<0.05). The relative risk of premature birth was over two times higher for pregnant smokers (RR = 2.25). 25% of patients exposed to alcohol and all the patients exposed to occupational pollutants had complications in pregnancy.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Alcohol use during pregnancy is one of the leading preventable causes of intellectual or developmental disability. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is the non-diagnostic umbrella term used to characterize the full range of damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. This situation clearly warrants intervention. Development of a focused, effective and evidence based intervention requires insight in the burden of FASD and the underlying dynamics. The current literature synthesis aims to provide the required evidence base by compiling the literature on FASD, specifically addressing what we know of the prevalence of FASD, which behaviors contribute to FASD, and which preventive measures have been recommended so far. Materials & Methods: A search was conducted in multiple electronic bibliographic databases up to April 2014, including PubMed, PsychInfo, PsychArticles, ERIC, CINAHL and EMBASE. A query was generated and the resulting hits were exported and screened by two independent screeners. All hits marked for inclusion by at least one screener were acquired, after which a second screening was conducted based on the full texts. Resulting articles will be examined to determine whether meta-analysis is feasible or whether a systematic review will be conducted. All materials, data, and analysis scripts will be made available publicly. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: n/a Conclusions: Results of the systematic literature search will be presented and specific recommendations for prevention efforts will be discussed.

N2  - Introduction: The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is an ongoing international collaboration of clinical and basic science researchers focused on improving the diagnosis and treatment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To assess genetic susceptibility to FASD, we first tested hypotheses of neuroteratogenic effects of candidate genes. The role of these genes was then tested using quantitative measures obtained from3-D facial images and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the candidate genes. Methods: Several genes were nominated for initial gene 9 alcohol exposure analyses. Genes in the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) pathways were identified using genetic screens in a zebrafishmodel. The Src family kinases (SFK) were implicated in studies showing that phosphorylation of L1 is necessary for ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion and that levels of SFK phosphorylation of L1 predict the severity of ethanol teratogenesis in C57BL/6mice. Analyses were performed in a sample of 101 children aged 8-18 years (mean 12.3) having 3D facial images andDNA. Analyses were limited toSNPs within +/- 15 kb of genes in the PGDF pathway (PDGFRAPDGFRB, PDGFB, PDGFC, and PDGFD) and in the Src kinase family (FYN, YES1, L1CAM, SRC). Landmarksweremanually placed to induce a dense correspondence of tens of thousands of points on the surfaces of 3D images. Principal components based on these points were used as facial shape phenotypes in a linear model to test for a SNP 9 alcohol exposure interaction, accounting for effects due to sex and age. Results: Overall width/length of the face were associated with SNPs in FYN (best p=3.1 x 10-6). The facial shape depicting hypertelorism and mandibular retraction was associated with SNPs in the 30 region of YES1 (best p=5.4 x 10-4) and in L1CAM (best p=7.4 x 10-5). Other facial shapes were associated with SNPs in PDGFC (best p=1.2 x 10-5) and with SNPs in PDGFRB (best p=9.8 x 10-4). There was modest association of facial shapes with SNPs in PDGFRA and PDGFD (best p=2.9 x 10-3). Conclusion: Several SNPs in candidate genes were significantly associated with facial shape variables, providing evidence that ethanol interacts with SFK and PDGF genes to induce variation in craniofacial phenotypes in humans exposed prenatally to alcohol.

N2  - Introduction: The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is an ongoing international collaboration of clinical and basic science researchers focused on the development of effective interventions and treatment approaches for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Prenatal alcohol exposure causes facial dysmorphismincluding shortened palpebral fissures, mid-facial hypoplasia, flat nasal bridge, smooth philtrum, and thin upper vermillion. 3D facial photographs capturing 25,000+ surface points are used to visualise and detect facial dysmorphism using a mathematical representation of 3D face shape that is also conducive to investigating candidate susceptibility genes. Methods: A small number of manually placed facial landmarks was used to induce a dense correspondence of tens of thousands of points on the face surfaces of 3D photographs of a study cohort of 101 individuals aged 8 to 18 years (mean 12.3). Following an alignment process, the average position of each densely corresponded point on the face surfaces was calculated to produce the average face shape of the cohort. A principal component analysis (PCA) of position difference of the densely corresponded points on the faces of cohortmembers from their position on the average face produced a set of PCAmodes capturing position correlations of the surface points ordered (high-tolow) according to the degree of shape variance they describe. Results: The contiguously generated PCA modes whose total coverage of shape variance was at least 99%, forming what is known as a dense surface model, were retained to synthesize the face shape of individual subjects and average faces of subgroups containing individuals with confirmed degrees of prenatal alcohol exposure as well as individuals without such exposure. A dense surface model was similarly constructed for the philtrum area alone. Conclusion: The resulting dense surface models were used to visualise and detect the face and philtrum shape differences between the alcohol exposed/unexposed subgroups. For this particular study, the set of PCA modes in the dense surface models also offered a very compactmulti-dimensional representation of each individual's face and philtrum, using only tens of PCAmodes, that was conducive to analysis along with genetic and alcohol exposure data in investigations of candidate susceptibility genes.

N2  - The importance of addressing preconception maternal health has been increasingly emphasized in recent years yet few preconception interventions exist that can be delivered in medical settings. Fifty percent of preconception women consume alcohol; 12.5%report binge drinking; and about 20% smoke in the months prior to pregnancy. Alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) are associated with a range of birth defects and developmental difficulties that span from behavioral and attention deficit disorders to FAS. Even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy can incur negative effects. Tobacco-exposed pregnancies (TEP) are also associated with a range of negative effects including premature birth, low birth weight, and 14 types of birth defects. The mortality rate of infants born to a mother with TEP is 40%higher than infants not exposed in utero to tobacco. Moreover, the overlapping risks of an alcohol- and tobacco-exposed pregnancy were more prevalent than either risk alone, suggesting the potential for multiplicative, deleterious outcomes. Methods: This randomized controlled study, Project CHOICES Plus, tested the efficacy of a two sessionmotivational intervention in reducing the risk of alcohol and tobacco exposed pregnancies compared to an Information Only group. CHOICES Plus was integrated into 11 primary care clinics in a large public hospital system. The CHOICES Plus intervention consisted of two sessions with a behavioral health counselor, a contraception visit with a primary care provider, and referral to a smoking cessation quit line or smoking cessation clinic. Eligible women were 18 to 44 years, fertile, sexually active, not using effective contraception, and drinking at risky levels. Mean age was 31 years; 47.1%were Hispanic, 41.8%Black, 10.0% White, and 3.0%Other. Less than half (43.6%) were working and 70.9%had household incomes <20 k. Results: The odds ratio (ORs) of being at reduced risk for AEP at three month follow up was threefold greater in the CHOICES Plus intervention group: 3.12 (95%CI-1.80-5.40) compared to the information only group. The odds ratio for being at reduced risk for TEP was nearly threefold greater, 2.76 (95%CI-1.22-6.26). Between group differences were 25.8%for AEP and 22.8%for TEP. Conclusion: The CHOICES Plus intervention was efficacious in reducing alcohol- and tobaccoexposed pregnancy in preconception women in primary care settings.

N2  - Background: The adverse effects of alcohol use during pregnancy include physical, cognitive, and behavioral deficits in children. Evenmoderate levels of alcohol use have resulted in pre-term delivery and low birth weight. As many as 50%of pregnancies are unintended, and 50%of those occur while a woman was using birth control; thus it is critical to target women at risk of pregnancy who drink above recommended levels to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). Several randomized control trials have documented the success of screening and brief intervention targeting both alcohol use and contraception use, but no trial has looked at the effectiveness of telephonebased intervention. Methods: A manualized brief intervention model targeted both alcohol use and contraception use in women at risk of pregnancy that engaged in risky drinking (>7 drinks/week or >3 on any occasion). Women ages 18-44 that screened positive were randomized into either the telephone or in-person intervention group. A total of 434 women completed a baseline assessment interview with 132 (30.4%) eligible to receive the intervention. Descriptive statistics (chi-square, difference inmeans tests, confidence intervals for proportions) established the equivalence of the two intervention arms. Logistic regression was used to estimate the efficacy of the intervention modality controlling for a wide range of measures. Results: Six-month follow-up results are available (see Wilton et al., 2013) showing a significant reduction in risk of an AEP from 100% to 29%(binomial CI95=0.206-0.391). After controlling for potentially confounding factors, intervention type (telephone vs. in-person) did not significantly predict any outcomes. A follow-up analysis will be presented looking at 1) paths to change in women with higher/lower consumption in each intervention condition and 2) qualitative data from individual intervention components including decisional balance for both alcohol and contraception; choice determinants of contraception methods; and satisfaction with the intervention. Conclusions: Prevention of AEP is a significant public health issue. Results support the effectiveness of telephone-based intervention as an equally effectivemethod of administration. The current analysis will support evidence for individual intervention components and differentiatemodels for women who drink at higher vs. lower consumption levels.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have lasting effects on functioning in many domains. Infants born to African-American and/or low SES women may be at increased risk of adverse effects. Computerdelivered screening, brief intervention, and referral for treatment approaches are a promising option for addressing this need in primary care settings, by providing consistent screening and evidencebased brief interventions at low cost without requiring substantial time or energy frommedical staff. This study evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and estimated effect size of a computer-delivered intervention through an N=50 Phase I randomized clinical trial. To date, forty-eight women have been enrolled in the randomized clinical trial, 26 of whom have completed the postpartum follow-up data collection. Of the 48 participants, 24 received the intervention. All intervention participants gave high ratings in terms of software approval; means ranged from 4.8 to 5.0 for ease of use, respectfulness, interest in working with the programagain, and excited about changing alcohol use during pregnancy. Comparisons of ratings taken before and immediately after completing the intervention found no significant changes regarding self-efficacy or the importance of quitting alcohol while pregnant (mean values on each item were extremely high at baseline). However, women reported feeling significantly more ready to quit drinking permanently after receiving the intervention [M=-10.33 and SD= 20.64; t(23)=-2.45, p=0.02] and reported increased perceptions of harm to the baby when alcohol is consumed during the pregnancy [M=-4.75 and SD=11.40; t(23)=-2.04, p=0.053]. Further, 75%of participants receiving the intervention indicated that it made them more likely to avoid alcohol use throughout pregnancy. These findings suggest that this computer-delivered SBIRT intervention was well received by participants and that it facilitated awareness of the harms associated with alcohol use during pregnancy. Follow-up results from the full N=50 pilot clinical trial are expected to be available soon, and will shed further light on the extent to which this intervention merits further investigation.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in children. Approximately half of pregnancies are unplanned and targeting both alcohol use and contraception in child-bearing age women is important for preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP). Methods: A dual-focused (i.e., alcohol use and contraception) brief physician intervention (DFBPI) was designed based on the brief intervention guidelines (Babor et al., 2007) and two evidence-based FASD prevention interventions (Fleming et al., 2008; Floyd et al., 2009) modified to be deliverable by OB/GYN physicians. The intervention consisted of two face-to-face, structured, 5-minute sessions incorporated in routine clinic visits. The intervention was evaluated in a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial in 20 district OB/GYN (women's) clinics in two locations in Russia, including St. Petersburg, a major urban city in North-West and the Nizhny Novgorod Region, a more rural centrally located area. Clinics were randomized to intervention or control/services as usual conditions. A total of 1,536 women were screened and 766 non-pregnant women, aged 18-44 years, at risk for an AEP (at-risk drinking and heterosexually active and inconsistently using contraception) were recruited for the study with follow-up at 3, 6, and 12-months. Results: The AEP risk reduced in both conditions with a stable time effect of approximately 50% of women in the entire sample not at AEP risk (40%among women with AUDIT >8). Across the followup period, the odds ratios of being at reduced risk for AEP were 1.4 fold greater in the intervention group at 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.89). The growthmodelling indicated a clinic effect, heterogeneity of paths to change, and an effect of the initial alcohol consumption level. Additional analyses that utilize person-centered approaches (e.g., growth mixture modeling) are necessary to account for individual change paths and alcohol consumption levels to evaluate individual variations and patterns of alcohol use and AEP risk changes. Conclusions: Results support the feasibility of the DFBPI at OBGYN clinics in Russia. Relatively small efforts such as assessment that includes asking women questions about their alcohol use and pregnancy possibility, achieve reductions of AEP risk among at-risk drinking childbearing women.

N2  - Recent studies indicate that one of themost common drinking patterns in pregnant women is to abstain during the 1st and 2nd trimesters, but consume alcohol during the 3rd trimester. Importantly, alcohol exposure during late pregnancy has been associated with increased incidence of anxiety in children and adolescents. However, the neurophysiological underpinnings of this behavioral deficit have not been investigated. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA), dopamine (DA) can modulate GABAergic inhibition by potentiating or suppressing GABA transmission via DA D1 receptor (D1R) or D3 receptor (D3R) activation, respectively, to appropriately regulate BLA activity. Consistent with physiological manipulations, pharmacological manipulation of DA receptors in the BLA of freely moving animals can alter anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, we examined the effect of low-to-moderate EtOH exposure during the 3rd trimester-equivalent (vapor chamber exposure during postnatal days (P)2- 12 that yielded pup blood EtOH concentrations of ~22 mM) on these D1R- and D3R-mediated effects. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in adolescent offspring (P40-50), we found that basal spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (s/mIPSCs) were not altered by EtOH exposure (p>0.05) in pyramidal neurons within the BLA. D1R activation increased sIPSC frequency and this effect was significantly attenuated in the EtOH-exposed animals (DA-induced change from baseline: air-exposed controls=38.19+/-7.4%, EtOH=16.00+/-3.34%; n=8, p<0.05). D3R activation decreased mIPSC frequency and this effect was abolished in the EtOH animals (DAinduced change frombaseline: air-exposed controls=-24.70+/-4.25%, EtOH=-8.55+/-4.16%; n=8, p<0.05). Western blotting studies suggest that the blunted D1R and D3R effects are not a result of changes in levels of these receptors. These findings suggest that DA regulation of BLA activity is disrupted following alcohol exposure during the 3rd trimester-equivalent, whichmay contribute to changes in anxiety-like behavior following prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can be detrimental to cognitive development.While both clinical and experimental research has largely focussed on learning,memory and attention difficulties, emerging clinical studies suggest a strong correlation between prenatal alcohol exposure and the incidence of anxiety related disorders during adolescence and adulthood. Despite this, little experimental research has investigated the relationship between anxiety and prenatal alcohol exposure, particularly in the context of low-moderate alcohol exposure. Over the last few years, we have developed a rodent model to investigate the effect of low dose prenatal alcohol exposure on anxiety behaviour as well as memory and learning in later life. Sprague Dawley rat dams were fed a liquid diet containing a low dose of ethanol (6% vol/vol, EtOH) or a calorie matched control diet (Control) throughout pregnancy. Male and female offspring underwent extensive behavioural testing between 7-9 months (Adult) or 15-18 months of age to assess anxiety-related behaviour and memory and learning. Pyramidal cell number within the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and hippocampus was assessed in male and female offspring using the optical fractionator method for unbiased stereology. The volume of the BLA was calculated using the Cavelieri principle. Morphology of the apical dendrite was also assessed for pyramidal cells within this region.EtOH animals exhibited significant increase in anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plusmaze (p<0.05), holeboard (p<0.05), emergence (p<0.05) and social interaction (p<0.05) tests. This increase in anxiety - like behaviour could not be attributed to a change in pyramidal cell number within the BLA, but rather was associated with an increase in dendritic spines along the apical dendrite which is indicative of an increase in synaptic connectivity and activity within these neurons. Interestingly, there were no deficits in learning or memory or alterations in the hippocampus. This study is the first to link increases in anxiety like behaviour to structural changes within the BLA in a model of prenatal ethanol exposure. In addition, this study has shown that exposure to even a relatively small amount of alcohol during development can lead to long term alterations in anxiety-like behaviour without overtly affecting learning and memory.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure resulting in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is the most common cause of neurodevelopmental impairments in the western world, with an estimated prevalence of 2- 5%. It is well established from studies in human, and rodent and Xenopus models of FASD that a single acute exposure to alcohol during the earliest stage of gastrulation is sufficient to induce the developmental defects associated with FAS. Our Vitamin A Hypothesis proposes that ethanol competitively interacts with the enzymes that normally would process retinol (Vitamin A) to retinoic acid (RA); and moreover, the resultant reduction of RA levels at this critical developmental stage can explain the neurodevelopmental defects of FAS at the molecular level. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we genetically engineered mice to express Cyp26A1-eGFP from the endogenous Goosecoid (Gsc) promoter. Overexpression of Cyp26A1 canmimic the effects of acute alcohol exposure by depleting the availability of RA; and the Gsc promoter will target expression specifically to the organizer region during early gastrulation. We report here that we have successfully derived mice with germline transmission of the Gsc:Cyp26A1-eGFP allele. RT-PCR analysis of the frontal face-brain region of E15-E16 embryos mice confirm expression of Cyp26A1 and eGFP in heterozygous mice in vivo. Gsc:Cyp26A1 F1 mice are born with an expected normal mendelian ratio of het:wt (0.95, n=127). This data indicates that Gsc:Cyp26A1, a dominant acting allele, does not severely impact overall development or viability (at least 6 months). Newborn F1mice were phenotypically assessed (blinded) for cranial-facial defects characteristic of FASD features that are well established in alcohol- treated mouse models (narrow and less well defined philtrum, compressed nasal passage area and flatter upper lip, compared to normal or untreated pups). Pups were later genotyped at weaning. Our analysis shows 88%(15/17) of mutant mice assessed had a discernable FAS phenotype. 100% of wild-typemice had been assessed as normal (14/14). Taken together, the data strongly supports that disregulation of RA signaling during early gastrulation can induce FAS-like cranio-facial developmental defects. The model will allow a full analysis of themolecular etiology of FASD and the therapeutic feasibility of new treatments to prevent or reduce ethanol-induced FASD.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol SpectrumDisorder (FASD) causes a range of cognitive impairment however the molecular aetiology underlying FASD is not fully understood. We hypothesize that developmental programming of gene expression via epigenetic mechanismsmay contribute to FASD. Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modifications (such as, methylation and acetylation), and miRNA. DNA and histone methylation require S-adenosylmethionine, the key methyl donor in the body, generated through the metabolism of methyl nutrients. Disturbances in methyl metabolism contribute to the pathology of adult alcoholic liver disease. As such, we postulate that prenatal exposure to alcohol is also associated with disturbances in methylmetabolism and affects epigenetic regulation of gene expression and contributes to FASD pathology. In the current study we assessed regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (Nr3c1) and the serotonin transporter gene (Slc6a4) in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of young adult rats exposed prenatally to alcohol (ethanol). Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a liquid ethanol diet (E), a pair-fed liquid control diet (PF), or lab chow (C) throughout pregnancy and the adult offspring were studied at 55 days of age. We found sex-specific and tissue-specific effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on expression of methyl metabolism genes (Mtr, Cbs, Mat2a, Mthfr).Male offspring from E dams had lower expression of Mtr and Cbs in hippocampus compared to those from C dams. Female offspring from E dams had higher hippocampal expression of Mtr, Mat2a, Mthfr, and Cbs compared to female offspring fromC dams. These effects were not observed in hypothalamus. Lower hippocampal Nr3c1mRNA from female offspring compared to offspring from PF dams was also found. This was accompanied by lower NGFI-A expression, a key transcriptional regulator of Nr3c1. No effects on Nr3c1 promoter methylation we observed. We also found lower hypothalamic Slc6a4 mRNA in male and female offspring from E dams and this was accompanied by greater Slc6a4 promoter methylation. These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol affects methyl metabolismand developmental programming of gene expression in the brain via epigenetic mechanisms.

N2  - Youth who initiate drinking before the age of 15 are at significantly higher risk for developing alcohol dependence or abuse in their lifetime than those who begin drinking at the legal age. Studies have identified lower parental monitoring, worse home environment, greater child depression, peer drinking, child conduct disorder, and parental drinking and history of alcoholism as primary risk factors of underage drinking. The purpose of this study is to identify and compare the characteristics of adolescents who tried alcohol before age 15, but did not continue to drink (desisters), with those who initiated drinking before age 15 and continued to drink (persisters). This report is from the 14- and 16- year follow-up of 917 participants in the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development project. Mothers were interviewed prenatally, and with their offspring at delivery, 6, 10, 14, and 16 years. A standardized protocol was used to assess the psychological, environmental, and substance use characteristics of the mothers and their offspring. At the 16-year phase, 43%of the adolescents were Caucasian, 51%were male, 47% reported alcohol use in the past year, 34%of the offspring initiated drinking before age 15, and 80%of them continued to drink at 16 years. A stepwise discriminant analysis was use to identify variables that distinguished the persister and desister groups. A large number of risk/protective factors including parenting practices, peer drinking, gender, child and maternal depression, childhood behavior, prenatal and current maternal alcohol use, age at delivery, custodian education, ethnicity, and life events were considered. Parent's strictness and African-American race were significantly related to protection against continued drinking. Prenatal exposure to 1 ormore drinks/day during the first trimester of pregnancy was significantly related to persistent drinking. Eight percent of the desisters were offspring of heavy prenatal alcohol users compared to 20%among the persisters. In conclusion even among adolescents with early onset drinking, race, parenting and prenatal alcohol exposure significantly distinguished between those who continued to drink and those who did not. As early alcohol initiation places adolescents at risk for continued and heavier drinking, identifying characteristics of those who start early but do or do not continue drinkingmay inform education programs to better target the most appropriate adolescents.

N2  - Heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy negatively impacts the physical growth of the fetus. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of maternal glutamine supplementation as an intervention strategy for the alterations in fetal bone growth, related hormonal responses and fetal bone biomechanics that occur withmaternal binge alcohol exposure during pregnancy. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to one of four groups: saline control, alcohol (1.75-2.5 g/kg body weight), glutamine (100 mg/kg body weight) or alcohol+glutamine. A chronic weekend binge drinking paradigm from gestational day (GD) 109 to 132 (human third trimester equivalent) was utilized. Animals were euthanized and fetal blood, femurs and tibias were collected on GD 132 (term ~147). Alcohol exposure resulted in ~40%reduction in fetal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) compared to the control groups (p<0.001). However, no significant effect of treatment group was observed on fetal levels of T3, T4 and free T4. Femoral and tibial diameters and femoral length were significantly decreased in the alcohol group compared to the saline control and alcohol+glutamine groups (p<0.05). Maximum bone breaking force (N) in the alcohol exposed twin fetuses was significantly decreased compared to the alcohol exposed singleton fetuses (Femur, p=0.016; Tibia, p=0.039); no significant differences were observed between singleton and twin fetuses for all other groups. These results indicate that maternal alcohol exposure negatively affects bone development in twin pregnancies more profoundly compared to the singleton pregnancies. Maximum bone breaking force for the twin fetuses was significantly increased in the alcohol+glutamine group compared to the alcohol group (Femur, p=0.020; Tibia, p=0.019) thus illustrating a protective effect. Fetal femoral and tibial ultimate stress (MPa) and tibial elastic modulus (MPa) was significantly increased in the alcohol group compared to all other groups. Micro-computed tomography-derived bone morphometric and densitometry analysis exhibited lower numerical values in the alcohol exposed group compared to the control group, however, no statistical significant effect of treatment group was observed. These results indicate thatmaternal alcohol exposure during the third trimester-equivalent period in sheep alters fetal bone development and glutamine supplementation couldmitigate this effect.

N2  - Detection of the direct alcohol biomarker, phosphatidylethanol (PEth), in dried blood spots fromheel sticks has been shown to be a feasible and sensitive method to screen newborns at risk for prenatal alcohol exposure.While heel stick punctures have been a reliable collectionmethod for blood PEth analysis, umbilical cord blood may be an alternative specimen that could be advantageous for multiple reasons: umbilical cord blood is available immediately following the birth of a child, allowing for 24 to 48 hours earlier collection and testing than heel stick blood spot samples that are typically collected for routine newborn screening; umbilical cord blood is easy to collect and place on a filter paper card (either through direct application or a syringe); larger volumes of blood fromumbilical cord can be collected than that from heel stick puncture; umbilical cord blood collection is noninvasive and does not require direct interaction with the newborn; and the earlier sample collection increases the detection window of exposure. For these reasons, our laboratory examined the feasibility of using umbilical cord blood as a specimen type for detecting PEth to screen for prenatal alcohol exposure in newborns. Umbilical cord blood from 165 births at the Charleston AreaMedical CenterWomen and Children's Hospital was collected, placed on filter paper cards, and dried for PEth analysis. The extraction and detection of PEth from the dried blood spot cards were completed using the liquid chromatography-tandemmass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method that was previously validated by our laboratory for heel stick dried blood spot cards. Of 165 umbilical cord blood spot samples examined, 28 (17%) of the samples were above the lower limit of quantitation for PEth (PEth >8 ng/mL), with concentrations of PEth ranging from 8.3 ng/mL to 520 ng/mL, and an average of 43.3 ng/mL. Results from this study demonstrate that umbilical cord blood spots are a feasible specimen alternative to heel stick blood spots for analysis of PEth. A direct comparison of PEth concentrations from umbilical cord blood spots, collected at birth, and PEth concentrations from heel stick blood spots, collected 24 to 48 hours after birth, will be examined in future studies to determine if the earlier collection results in increased PEth concentrations and sensitivity of identifying probable prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - As part of an evaluation of the State of Hawaii's Perinatal Support program for at-risk mothers, we examined the impact of services on the reduction of alcohol use during pregnancy to inform prevention efforts of the Hawaii Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Task Force. This study focused on ethnically diverse population in Hawaii, with a significant Asian and Pacific Islander population. Secondary data analysis was performed on a sample of 7,186 women whomwere enrolled in the program fromJuly 2007 to June 2012. Sociodemographic information, alcohol use, and other related behavioral risk factors were assessed at intake and subsequent trimester follow-ups. The mean age for participants was 25.6 years (sd=6.3). Of the sample, 9.6%were Caucasian, 5.5%Hispanic, 1.2%African American, 8.4%Asian, 15.9%Filipino, 22%Pacific Islanders (Micronesian), 7.5%other Pacific Islanders, 28.8% Native Hawaiian, and 1.1%Other. Overall, 9.6% of women screened positive or endorsed alcohol use at intake (regardless of trimester). There were significant differences in rates of alcohol use in the first trimester by ethnicity, where African American (18.9%), Native Hawaiian (17.5%), Filipino (13.1%), Caucasian (12.9%), Other (11.6%), and other Pacific Islanders (11.1%) weremore likely to endorse alcohol compared to Asian (6%), Hispanic (4.4%), and Pacific Islanders (Micronesian; 2.8%) (chi2 [9, n=3,708] 99.165, p<0.0001). Of a subset of women who were assessed in both first and second trimesters (n=2,494), 10.7%showed a reduction in alcohol risk, 3.3%continued to endorse alcohol use in the second trimester, and 1.3%newly endorsed alcohol use in the second trimester. From women who were also assessed in third trimester (n=1,942), of those who dropped alcohol use during the second trimester, 82.4%continued abstinence of alcohol use. Of the women who endorsed alcohol during the first and second trimesters, 38% stopped during the third trimester. These findings highlight the importance of prevention intervention programs in the reduction of alcohol use during pregnancy. Variation in alcohol by ethnicity suggests that ethnocultural differencesmay also be important for improving screening and intervention approaches.

N2  - This study examinedmechanisms of the treatment effect found for CHOICES (Floyd, et al. 2007), a motivational intervention to reduce the risk of alcohol exposed pregnancy (AEP).We examined the mediating effects of the processes of change (POC) proposed by the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). CHOICES is grounded in the TTM, which posits 5 experiential and 5 behavioral POC. Experiential POC occur in the earlier stages of change, and relate to one's thought processes and situational experiences. Behavioral POC occur in the later stages of change and are more action-oriented.We hypothesized that assignment to CHOICES would be positively associated with experiential POC at 3-months, which would predict behavioral POC and treatment outcome at 9-months. Treatment outcomes included risky drinking (RD), ineffective contraception (IEC) and AEP. In CHOICES, 830 women at-risk for AEP were randomized to either CHOICES or brief advice and referral. Primary outcomes and proposed mediators (POC) were assessed at 3 and 9 months. Path analyses using weighted least squares estimation with a mean and variance adjusted chi-square statistic were conducted. Indirect effects were estimated usingMODEL INDIRECT (bootstrapped 95%CI, 5,000 resamples). Analyses were performed separately for each of the three outcome variables.Model fit indices indicated good fit, and the indirect effect of treatment group on outcome via POC variables was significant for the models predicting RD and IEC. Treatment assignment was positively associated with experiential POC, which in turn was positively associated with behavioral POC and reduced risk of RD and EC in thosemodels. The indirect effect of treatment group on AEP through EC processes was significant, but the indirect effect through RD processes was not. Findings support the temporal relationship between experiential and behavioral POC consistent with the TTM. Motivation-based interventions may benefit from using strategies that directly target experiential POC early in treatment and behavioral POC later in treatment.

N2  - This randomized trial evaluated effects of FASD education brochures on knowledge, attitudes, and alcohol consumption among childbearing age women in two regions in Russia. A total of 458 women (101 were pregnant and 357 non-pregnant) were recruited from women's clinics and randomly assigned to receiving: (1) a FASD education brochure with positive images and information stated in a positive way, positive group (PG); or (2) a FASD education brochure with negatively presented information, negative group (NG); or (3) a general healthmaterial, control group (CG). Face-to-face structured interviews to assess women's alcohol consumption, knowledge about FASD, and attitudes were conducted at baseline and at a one-month follow-up. The interview utilized internationally-recognized measures and was pilot tested prior to implementation. NIH definitions of women's at-risk drinking were utilized. Quantile regression, McNemar's and Fisher's tests were performed. This presentation aimed at identification of effects of FASD education brochures on women's alcohol consumption. A high proportion of women in this sample were at-risk because of their binge drinking. The three groups/study conditions did not differ in proportions of at-risk drinkers at baseline. There was a significant decrease in alcohol consumption between baseline and one-month follow-up in all three study conditions. The effect was higher in both experimental conditions (PG and NG) compared to CG and in PG compared to NG. As indicated by risk ratio coefficients in all three study conditions, women who were at-risk drinkers at baseline were less likely to change their alcohol use and more likely to sustain at-risk alcohol consumption at follow-up. Participation in the study and answering questions about alcohol consumption had an intervention effect and led to a reduction of alcohol consumption in both experimental and control conditions. Receiving a FASD education brochure was associated with a higher reduction in the proportion of atrisk drinking women at follow-up compared to women who received a general health information brochure. The reduction was higher among women who received a brochure with positive images and positively stated information. The study indicated that providing FASD education brochures, particularly brochures with positively presented information, has a significant effect on alcohol use among women.

N2  - Background: While impaired inhibitory control has been observed in alcohol-exposed youth, the neural structures associated with this deficit have not been fully delineated. We examined whether the structural correlates of inhibitory control may be altered by prenatal alcohol exposure by modeling the relations between cortical thickness and inhibition in exposed and non-exposed youth. Secondarily, we investigated the degree to which multi-method inhibition assessments reflect the same underlying brain structure by analyzing both a neurocognitive and caregiver-report measure. Method: Adolescents ages 11.3-17.8 (M=13.3) with prenatal alcohol exposure (AE; n=15) and non-exposed controls (CON; n=15) underwent structural MRI scanning and neuropsychological assessment, which included two measures of inhibition: a neurocognitive test (D-KEFS Inhibition subtest) and a caregiver-report questionnaire (BRIEF Inhibit scale). Cortical thickness estimates were obtained via FreeSurfer v5.1.0.Whole brain general linear models were run to identify regions where cortical thickness related to inhibition. Adjustment to correct for multiple comparisons was set at p<0.05. Results: After adjustment for multiple comparisons, significant group9inhibition interactions were found in two regions. In the right anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal region, thinner cortex was associated with better D-KEFS scores for AE, but worse performance for CON. In the leftmiddle and inferior temporal gyri, thinner cortex was associated with poorer inhibition scores for AE but better BRIEF inhibitory control for CON. No group differences in cortical thickness were seen. Conclusions: Regional trajectories of cortical maturation vary in typical adolescent brain development, with some areas thinning earlier and others later in the teenage years. For the neurocognitive test, cortical thickness was associated with frontal regions important for inhibition and executive control, while the caregiver-report was related to temporal regions that may be involved in socio-emotional processes. The two measures were associated with distinct neural regions, suggesting that they may capture different components of inhibition. In addition, although inhibition was associated with similar brain regions in both groups, the directionality of the relationships differed, reflecting a possible shift in cortical maturation patterns.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce a variety of consequences on the developing brain, which result in a vast array of cognitive impairment and behavioral disruption. Previous reports have demonstrated that the basal ganglia appear to be specifically affected in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. However, it is not yet known how the basal ganglia volumetric reductions may be related to other indices of prenatal alcohol exposure-induced neurodevelopmental disruption. Method: T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) were acquired on a 3T scanner for 44 adolescents age 13.0-15.9 (M=14.2, SD=0.85), with (n=22) and without (n=22) histories of prenatal alcohol exposure. Using FreeSurfer v5.1.0 estimates of caudate and putamen were obtained bilaterally, and whole brain general linear models were used to examine the relationship between these subcortical structures and cortical thickness. Results significant at p<0.05 after correction for multiple comparison are reported. Results: In prenatal alcohol exposed adolescents, caudate and putamen volumes were positively related to cortical thickness in regions of the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. In control adolescents such relationships were absent or were in the opposite direction. Conclusions: The relationship between cortical depth and striatal volumes suggests that these neural structures develop in tandem, as part of a system. Given that prenatal alcohol exposed adolescents with reduced striatal volumes also present with thinner cortex, a relationship that is distinct from what is observed in controls, these results emphasize that the alcohol-induced neurodevelopmental disruption occurs at a systems level. Further examination of the relationships among brain structures in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposuremay lead to a better understanding of the associated neural disruption, and may aid in progressing toward utilization of MRI in the diagnostic process.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can adversely affect fetal brain development, thereby leading to a range of cognitive and behavioral deficits. However, little is known about the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on gyrification. Gyrification reflects cortical complexity and is a process by which the surface of the brain creates sulci and gyri. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated gyrification patterns in adolescents with and without histories of prenatal alcohol-exposure. Method: Subjects (12-16 y, M=14.92) comprised two age-equivalent groups: adolescents with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, n=17) and non-exposed controls (CON, n=18). All participants underwent structural MRI scans on a 3T scanner. Local gyrification indices (LGIs) were obtained using FreeSurfer v5.1.0. Vertex-wise general linear models were used to determine between group differences in LGI. Age was included in the model to determine whether the associations between age and LGIs differed between groups. Correction for multiple comparisons were applied using a cluster-wise threshold of p<0.05. Results: In the right hemisphere, clusters of significant age9group interactions were located in the middle and superior temporal gyri, precentral gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, and lateral occipital gyrus (ps<0.05). Reductions in LGI with increasing age were evident in all clusters in the AE group. For the CON group increases in LGI with age were only evident in the lateral occipital gyrus and superior temporal gyri. In the left hemisphere, a cluster of significant age9group interactions was found in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, greater gyrification was associated with increasing age in the CON group only. Conclusions: The differences in age-related LGI changes between groups suggest possible alterations in the neurodevelopmental aspects of cortical gyrification as a result of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. This study provides further insight into the pathophysiology and brainmaturation of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. Adolescence is a period characterized by dramatic changes in brain structure and function. Altered gyrification during this critical period of brain development may reflect changes in the underlying brain connectivity andmay have implications for understanding cognitive dysfunction in alcohol-exposed adolescents.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with dysregulation of the stress system. Pre-existing dysregulation of the stress system may be a major factor underlying the development of psychopathologies such as depression and anxiety. Alcohol-induced changes in the overlapping neurocircuitries that underlie stress dysregulation and psychopathologies are not fully understood. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the neural activity in central areas known to play key roles in emotional and stress regulation. Pregnant rats were assigned to either Alcohol (PAE) - liquid alcohol diet ad libitum; Pair-fed (PF) - liquid control diet yoked to PAE consumption; or Control - control diet ad libitum. In adulthood, male and female offspring were exposed to 10 days of chronic mild stress (CMS), or remained undisturbed. Following CMS, neural activity (c-fos mRNA) of the amygdala, ventral hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) was assessed in response to an acute stress (5 min on the elevated plus maze). To identify networks of coordinated activity in these brain regions rather than to identify whether activity differed between the experimental groups for each individual brain area, we employed constrained principal component analysis (CPCA). CPCA indicates that compared to controls, PAE males rely less on the amygdala and ventral hippocampus and more on themPFC and PVN when facing a stressful situation. In contrast, CPCA indicates that the functional neural networks underlying stress and emotional regulation in females are more restricted, as PAE females rely primarily on the mPFC and amygdala. Additionally, our results indicate that CMS differentially affected the neural networks regulating stress and emotion in PAE and control animals. Indeed, in males, exposure to CMS reduced the neural activity of the amygdala and ventral hippocampus in controls and reduced the neural activity of the mPFC and PVN in PAE animals. In females, CMS only reduced the activity of the mPFC in PAE. Together, our results suggests that PAE, associated or not with CMS, resulted in a sexually dimorphic dysregulation of the neurocircuitry that underlies stress and emotional regulation, which may be implicated in the stress hyperresponsivity and increased vulnerability to develop psychopathologies observed among PAE individuals.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to increase addiction risk. Results from this laboratory show that prenatal alcohol exposure leads to an increased rectification index of AMPA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in dopaminergic (DA) neurons within the ventral tegmental area (VTA). These findings suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure might result in increased expression of the AMPA receptors lacking the GluR2 subunit on VTA DA neurons, an important cellular mechanism for addictive behavior. The purpose of this study was to quantitate the species and density of the AMPA receptor subunits/dendrite with immuno-electron microscopy. Sixmale Sprague Dawley pups were treated prenatally with ethanol (4-6 g/kg ethanol via intragastric intubation from gestational day 8-20) and six served as controls. At the end of treatment, pups were perfused with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1%glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH=7.4). The VTA was dissected and the tissue dehydrated, embedded in LRWhite resin, sectioned at 80 nm, and affixed to nickel grids. A set of three grids were stained/ block of tissue and two blocks quantitated per rat. All grids/set were labelled with a monoclonal antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). In addition, each grid was labelled with polyclonal antibodies against either the GluR1, GluR2, or GluR3 subunits of the AMPA receptor. The AMPA receptor subunits were visualized through labelling with a secondary antibody coupled with a 6 nm colloidal gold particle whereas 15 nm colloidal gold particles were used for TH. Grids were viewed with a JEOL 100 CX electronmicroscope and the density of GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 particles/ dendrite was determined on 25-30 TH+ and TH - dendrites within each field. Results showed that GluR3 (p=0.05) was significantly increased in the alcohol exposed group. There was no significant change in the density of the other subunits except a trend towards an increase (12%) in the GluR1 subunit and decreases in the GlurR2 subunit (8%). These results support the premise that prenatal alcohol exposure leads to increased GluR2- lacking AMPA receptors on VTA DA neurons, which might contribute to increased addiction risk.

N2  - Induction of holoprosencephaly (HPE) inmice occurs between 7-8.5 gestational days (GD), corresponding in human development from themiddle of the 3rd week to early in the 4th week.Mice acutely exposed to ethanol on GD 7 results in a HPE phenotype. Similarly, retinoic acid exposure on GD 7 results in a wide range of severity within the HPE spectrum in mice. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that variations in the phenotype in humans will be based on timing of the ethanol and retinoic acid exposure as is the case inmice. In the Ukraine, 310 pregnant women between 11 and 24 weeks gestation were enrolled in this cohort study.Maternal blood samples and data on daily alcohol exposure in the most recent two weeks and the week around conception were collected. Micronutrients levels including Vitamin A were measured. Inner canthal distance (ICD) percentile as a measure of hypotelorism and palpebral fissure length (PFL) percentile as a measure ofmicrophthalmia in relation to alcohol dose and timing of exposure were measured, as well as mid-trimester Vitamin A levels. For every absolute ounce of alcohol consumed in the most recent 2 weeks per drinking day and hour, there was a 5-6 percentage point reduction in ICD percentile. Additionally, the proportion of drinking days accounted for a 19 percentage point reduction in ICD percentile. For every ounce of absolute alcohol consumed per drinking hour in the week around conception, there was a 5 percentage point reduction in PFL percentile. For every absolute ounce of alcohol consumed in the most recent 2 week period per day, per drinking day and hour, there was a 6-16 percentage point reduction in PFL percentile. Additionally, the proportion of drinking days accounted for a 19 percentage point reduction in PFL percentile. For every unit higher Vitamin A blood level, there was a 20-25 percentage point reduction in ICD percentile; there was no relation between Vitamin A levels and PFL percentile. It was not possible in this human study to clearly differentiate between women who stopped drinking at <21 days gestation as opposed to women who continued to drink beyond that time, however the dose in the most recent 2 weeks likely represents continued drinking including the first 21 days post-conception. These data provide important information regarding the timing and mechanism of alcohol induced craniofacial anomalies in humans and raise important questions regarding the effect of retinoic acid teratogenesis.

N2  - Following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), a complex pattern of impairments in cognition, self-regulation, and adaptive functioning are observed, which correspond with alterations in brain structure. However, little is known about how white matter connectivity among regions is altered by PAE. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique that allows for assessment of white matter tract integrity by measuring restriction of water diffusion, known as fractional anisotropy (FA). During development, both FA and myelination of tracts increase, and FA likely reflects in part the degree of myelination. Evidence from rodent and human studies suggests that myelination is reduced by PAE; however, little is known about how PAE alters whitemattermicrostructure along major tracts. DTI images were obtained in FASD and Control adolescents (n=48, 8-18 yrs, X=13+/-2 years,48% female) as part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD). Alongtract statistics were utilized to investigate integrity of white matter at specific points along 9 major tracts across boys and girls, controlling for multiple Point by Tract comparisons at p<0.05. Similar to previous findings, an overall decrease in whole brain FA was observed among adolescents with FASD compared to Control counterparts (p=0.014). This effect was driven largely by lower FA in the right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and right corticospinal tract (CST) (p's<0.0001) and a similar statistical trend for the left CST (p=0.004). An overall increase in number of streamlines comprising the tracts was observed between FASD compared to Control adolescents (p=0.003), and this effect was predominantly observed in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO) (p=0.001). These novel results identify specific points along white matter tracts that may be more vulnerable to the effects of PAE. The present findings have implications for understanding cognitive and behavioral alterations commonly observed among adolescents with a FASD that specifically implicate connections between the: 1) thalamus and prefrontal cortex (ATR), or 2) motor system and spinal tract (CST). Future research will investigate the sexually dimorphic effects of PAE on structural connectivity and associated cognitive deficits. These findings, which demonstrate specific alterations related to PAE, could potentially enhance future interventions.

N2  - Because prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with growth deficiency, very little attention has been paid to the potentially high prevalence of overweight and obesity in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) compared to the population as a whole. This study examined the prevalence of overweight/obesity in a large representative clinical sample of children and adolescents with FASD and sought to identify characteristics associated with increased risk for obesity in these individuals. Children, ages 2 to 19 years, who were evaluated for FASD at University Clinics included 446 participants with an FASD diagnosis and 171 participants with no-FASD diagnosis. The prevalence of overweight/obesity (BMI >85 percentile) was compared to national and state prevalence rates. BMI was examined in relation to FASD diagnosis, gender, age, and behavior regulation. Dietary intake data was also examined for a young sub-sample (n=42). Thirty-four percent of children and adolescents with any FASD diagnosis were overweight or obese, which did not differ fromthe prevalence among U.S. children or among the no-FASD group. However, high rates of overweight/obesity were seen in those with Partial FAS diagnoses (40%). In addition, adolescents (ages 13 to 19) with any FASD diagnosis had elevated rates (42%), particularly among females (50%). The rate of overweight/obesity in adolescent females with FASD was nearly three times higher than the state prevalence for adolescent females (17-18%), p<0.001. Poor behavioral regulation on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function and increased impulsivity on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test-II were correlated with higher BMI. In the young subsample, low effortful control on the Child Behavior Questionnaire was correlated with dietary fat intake, r=-0.33, p=0.033. Overweight and obesity are common in adolescents with FASD (particularly in females), in those with a Partial FAS diagnosis, and in those with poor behavior control. These data suggest that clinicians treating patients with FASD should consider dietary and other interventions for the highest-risk individuals.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to identify risk factors and determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in the alcohol exposed pediatric population. Methods: A retrospective chart review study (N=64) from a single fetal substance exposure clinic was conducted. The chart review analyzed total 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels of pediatric patients of a single physician at the initial clinical assessment between April 2012 and May 2013. Vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency and deficiency were defined as 25(OH)D>30 ng/ml (>75 nmol/L), 20-29 ng/ml (50-75 nmol/L) and <20 ng/ml (<50 nmon/L). The study included 64 patients (58% female) aged 10 months to 21 years 7 months. Patients were excluded if they were on current treatment dosages of vitamin D or calcium. Results: Of those measured, 29.5% were deficient and 44.3% were insufficient, with a combined total of 73.8%of patients below target levels of vitamin D. There was no significant effect from sex, ethnicity, regions they were born in, state they are currently living in, or other types of prenatal chemical exposure(s). Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency is highly prevalent in the alcohol exposed pediatric population and clinics evaluating children for FASD should consider universal screening and treatment given the levels demonstrated in this study. Further studies are needed to determine if suboptimal levels of vitamin D may contribute to the growth failure, behavioral and cognitive issues seen in the alcohol exposed pediatric population.

N2  - This study seeks to determine the extent and duration of alcohol use that occurs while breastfeeding, and the effect that alcohol exposure via breast milk may have on the offspring. Maternal risk factor data were collected in theWestern Cape Province of South Africa from 1,294 mothers of first grade students in four, large, in-school study samples of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among first graders enrolled in 60 primary schools in five communities. The maternal subjects of the study are the mothers of children: 1) who were diagnosed with a specific diagnosis within the continuum of FASD, or 2) who were randomly-selected as candidates for a control/comparison group and their child was not diagnosed with an FASD or another known anomaly. Overall, 89.4% of all mothers in these communities breastfed these children for a mean duration of 19.8 months. Most mothers of children with an FASD breastfed (91.4%) for an average of 21.3 months as did 84.4%ofmothers of the controls for an average of 18.7 months; these differences were not statistically significantly different. Eighty-eight percent of the mothers of children with an FASD, 85.7%of the mothers of the prenatally- alcohol-exposed normal controls, and 29.4%of the mothers of prenatally unexposed controls reported drinking while breastfeeding. The mothers of children with an FASD who drank while breastfeeding had significantly higher reported drinking levels than the drinking mothers of the control children. Children with an FASD diagnosis who had also been exposed to alcohol via breastmilk had significantly more dysmorphology than those with FASD who were not exposed to alcohol in the breast milk (16.5 vs. 14.6, t=2.68, p=0.009). Among the controls, there is no significant difference in total dysmorphology based on alcohol exposure via breastmilk (8.4 vs. 7.8, t=0.78, p=0.438). Adjusting for maternal physical characteristics, demographics, pregnancy variables, and drinking during pregnancy (strong covariates of an FASD diagnosis), sequential logistic regression analysis indicated thatmothers who drank alcohol while breastfeeding were 6.5 times more likely to have a child with an FASD diagnosis than weremothers who did not drink during the breastfeeding period (B=1.863, p=0.011, OR=6.446).

N2  - This study will determine if there is a difference in maternal risk factors and the prevalence and severity of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) for mothers who live and work on farms versus those of mothers who work on farms but live in nearby towns in theWestern Cape Province (WCP) of South Africa (ZA). FASD occur when a foetus is exposed to substantial amounts of alcohol in the prenatal period, especially through maternal binge drinking. In five study communities of the WCP, the prevalence of FASD reportedmost recently is 13.5%to 20.8%, the highest prevalence documented anywhere in the world. Epidemiology studies in theWCP have found that farm workers generally have the poorest socio-economic circumstances, high fertility, poor nutrition, and the most regular and heavy patterns of binge drinking during pregnancy. Each of these factors increases the risk of bearing a child with an FASD, and not coincidentally, the highest rates of FASD have been found among farm workers. The majority of farm workers have traditionally been residents on farms where they work; however, recent residential trends are changing, and it is now more common for a higher proportion of farm workers to live in near-by towns. Although the living circumstances of many farm workers have increased notably during the past years, a substantial number of farm workers have lost their permanent jobs and homes on farms andmoved to towns. Some female farm workers may live in dire circumstances, for many are now seasonal workers with no job security or benefits, and access to alcohol may be greater for those living in the towns. Others who have moved to the towns may be forming new patterns of living and norms that will protect their offspring from alcohol exposure and therefore FASD-related disabilities. A collaborative research teamfromthe USA and ZA have researched the epidemiology of FASD over the past 16 years, and can now ask: how do these residence patterns influence maternal risk for, and rates of, FASD? The accumulated data sets for 6,767 children and 2,625 of their mothers will be analysed to compare differential patterns and factors of maternal risk (e.g. quantity, frequency, and timing of alcohol use, childbearing, and socioeconomic), specific indicators of child outcome (dysmorphology and cognitive/behavioural), and differential diagnoses of FASD for farm workers living in towns versus on farms.

N2  - This study was launched to determine the prevalence of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the characteristics and traits of children with FASD, normal controls, and their mothers in the general population of a rural area of the Western Cape Province (WCP) of South Africa (ZA). The epidemiology of FASD has been well studied and described in the extant literature for the more urban/small city, western portion of theWCP close to the Cape Town metropolitan area. In those previous studies of first grade children, extremely extremely high rates of FASD have been reported: fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) rates of 59 to 91 per 1,000, and total FASD rates of 13.5 to 20.7%. Also in previous studies, the prevalence of FASD was highest in the rural areas surrounding the small cities, as low socioeconomic status (SES), insufficient nutrition, high fertility, and norms supporting heavy binge drinking are common among a substantially higher portion of the rural, childbearing population. This new, in-school study of first grade children and their mothers was undertaken in four, previously unstudied, rural communities of theWCP that are substantially farther away andmore isolated from Cape Town. Geographically, socially and economically isolated, SES is lower in these rural, agricultural communities where alcohol consumption among men and women is believed to be more prevalent and severe than in most communities in ZA. There were 1870 first grade students enrolled, 1062 of whomentered the full study via: 1) height, weight and/or head circumference <25th centile, 2) random selection as candidates for controls (if they were not eventually diagnosed in the study as having an FASD or another anomaly), or 3) teacher referral. Following dysmorphology examination, cognitive/behavioral testing, and risk factor interview of the mothers, final Institute of Medicine diagnoses were made: FAS=173; PFAS=109; ARND=59; and ARBD=0. Detailed group comparisons of children with a specific diagnosis within the FASD continuum with controls (those prenatally exposed to alcohol and those not exposed) will be presented for physical dysmorphology and cognitive/behavioral traits. Alcohol use and other traits and behaviors of the maternal groups will also be described and linked to child diagnoses. The prevalence of FASD in these rural communities is very high: FAS occurs in 92.5 to 162.9 per 1,000 children and total FASD affects 18.2%to 32.1%.

N2  - Previous studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with poorer reading and phonological awareness. We have recently confirmed that prenatal alcohol is associated with poorer reading comprehension in elementary school-aged children in Cape Town, South Africa, and that this effect is mediated by slower reading rate. This finding is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating alcohol-related impairment in information processing speed. 282 adolescents (M age=14.4, SD=0.6), from the Detroit Longitudinal Cohort, whosemothers' alcohol use was ascertained during pregnancy, were administered the reading component of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, which is comprised of the basic reading (phonological processing and single word reading) and reading comprehension scales. IQ was assessed on theWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd Ed (WISC-III); the WISC-III Processing Speed Index was used tomeasure processing speed. ADHD symptoms were assessed on the Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) scale, which was completed by the parent, classroom teacher, and test examiner. After control for confounders, prenatal alcohol exposure was related to poorer reading comprehension (b=-0.13, p<0.05) but not to basic reading. The Sobel method was used to determine whether IQ, processing speed, and ADHD symptoms mediated the effect of prenatal alcohol on reading comprehension. Both ADHD symptoms (z=-2.65, p<0.01) and processing speed (z=-2.20, p<0.05) weremediators of the relation between prenatal alcohol and reading comprehension, whereas overall intellectual competence (Full Scale IQ) was not (z=-1.41, p=0.157).We next tested a model in which both processing speed and ADHD symptoms were considered as mediators using a bootstrapped multivariate extension of the Sobel test. Bias-corrected 95%confidence intervals showed that the total indirect effect was significant (CI=-6.89 to-0.81) and that the indirect effects of bothmediators (processing speed: CI=-5.37 to -0.37; ADHD symptoms; (CI=-2.82 to -0.03) were significant and similar in effect size. Although basic reading skills may have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure earlier in development, this effect was no longer evident in adolescence. Instead, the alcohol effect on reading comprehension was mediated by alcohol-related increases in ADHD symptomatology and slower processing speed.

N2  - Background: Neurobehavioral consequences of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure are well documented. Determining whether age and sex interacts with these effects may provide a basis for targeted intervention strategies. The current study examined the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, sex, and age on behavioral and cognitive functioning in children. Methods: Subjects were 124 children (5-16y, M=11.98), 69 with prenatal alcohol exposure (the AE group) and 55 without (the CON group). Children were administered the NEPSY while their parents completed the VABS interview. All scores were standardized by age. Two age groups were considered: 5-11 (young) and 12-16 (old). Data were analyzed using MANCOVA with a 2 (Exposure) x 2 (Sex) x 2 (Age) design. Race, ethnicity, SES, and handedness were included as covariates when appropriate. Results: For neuropsychological performance, the MANCOVA indicated significant main effects of AE and age (ps<0.017). Sex was not significant, nor were there any significant interactions in the omnibus analysis. Follow-up univariate tests revealed significant main effects of AE (AEps<0.048) on the omnibus MANCOVA, with no significant interactions. Follow-up univariate tests revealed that children with AE had lower scores in all domains (social, communication, and daily living skills). Older children had lower daily living skills and communication scores, while males had lower scores for social and communication domains. Conclusion: As previously reported, prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in impairment in both neuropsychological and behavioral functioning. Clinically, the lack of interactions in these findings indicates consistent patterns of performance across age and sex, regardless of exposure history. Across groups, the younger group performed better than the older group on both neuropsychological and behavioral measures, and girls performed better than boys on behavioral measures. These cross-sectional data indicate that boysmay be more at risk for behavioral deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure and these impairments could potentially be exacerbated as cognitive and behavioral demands increase in adolescence.

N2  - Whereas children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS) exhibit distinctive facial dysmorphology, the term alcohol-related neurodevelopomental disorders (ARND) is applied to prenatally-exposed individuals who exhibit neurobehavioral deficits while lacking this dysmorphology. In an attempt to improve identification of ARND in a well-characterized Cape Coloured sample, Suttie et al. (2013) applied a dense surfacemodel approach to 3D photographs, in which sparse landmarks induced a correspondence of thousands of points to capture subtle shape differences. For themore heterogeneous heavily exposed (HE) nondysmorphic phenotype, a novel clustering technique, shape signature graph analysis, was used, which involved normalizing face shape with respect to a control group and connecting individuals with themost similar facial dysmorphism. Signature graph analysis identified about half of the nonsyndromal HE group as having facial dysmorphism similar to the children with FAS and PFAS compared to healthy controls (the "HE1 group"), whereas the others were more similar to the controls ("HE2"). 161 children (17 FAS, 23 PFAS, 59 HE nonsyndromal, 62 controls) from this Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort were assessed on theWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (4th Ed; WISC-IV) and the California Verbal Learning Task (CVLT) at 9 years. Their mothers had been interviewed during pregnancy to determine their alcohol consumption using a timeline follow-back interview. The children were examined at 5 years by three expert dysmorphologists for fetal alcohol-related anomalies and growth impairment. WISC IQ was related to diagnostic group in a dose-dependent fashion. On theWISC-IV Verbal Comprehension Index and the CVLT, the scores in the HE1 group were similar to those in the FAS and PFAS groups, whereas the HE2 group's performance resembled that of the controls. The HE1 and HE2 groups did not differ, however, on the three otherWISC-IV indices-Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed, or on alcohol-related eyeblink conditioning. These data suggest that the subtle facial dysmorphology differences revealed by the Suttie et al. dense surface analysis are related specifically to deficits in the verbal domain, possibly due to effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on underlying frontal lobe structure and function that may mediate effects on verbal performance.

N2  - Purpose of study: Neurobehavioral problems may manifest differently over a range of ages in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We previously found that school teachers in a South African region reported significant behavior problems in learners with FASD aged 6 and 10 years compared to typically developing controls. This study aimed to examine the behavioral profile of an older (adolescent) age-band of prenatally alcohol-exposed children in the same regional setting. Methods: Participants were children with prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) (n=56) and no or minimal alcohol exposure (CON) (n=62). Participants were recruited from a previous epidemiological study in this high risk community in the Western Cape Province. As part of a multisite CIFASD study, children's teachers completed the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) teacher report form (TRF), rating behavior Symptom Scales including: anxiety/depression (ANX/DEP), social problem (SOC), internalizing (INT) and obsessive compulsive (OCD) symptoms and DSM-oriented conditions: affect (AFF), anxiety (ANX), somatic (SOM), inattention (INATT), hyperactivity/ impulsivity (HYPER-IMP), ADHD, oppositional defiant (OD) and conduct problems (CD). Mean age at TRF assessment was 14.9 yr (S.D=0.64). Data were analyzed using ANOVA and dependent outcomes were covaried for age, sex and IQ. The relationship between maternal drinking in pregnancy and TRF scores was measured with Spearman correlations. Results: Teachers rated the ALC group as having significantly more problems in most TRF domains. After covariant analysis, there remained significant effects of group on ANX/DEP, SOC and INT symptoms and INATT, AFFECT, ANX and OCD DSM-oriented conditions. Bivariate correlations were significant between maternal alcohol consumption (first trimester drinks per day and occurrence of binge drinking) and higher ratings of problem behaviors. Conclusion: A range of significant problem behaviors in South African children with prenatal alcohol exposure persist into adolescence. Not all behaviorally affected alcohol-exposed children meet clinical diagnostic criteria for FASD. These findings have implications for early recognition of children at risk and development of relevant educational and classroom behavior support strategies.

N2  - The goal of this study is to develop diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) that can be used in infancy and very early childhood. FASD occur when fetuses are exposed to alcohol in the prenatal period via maternal drinking, usually through heavy, binge drinking. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most clinically recognizable formof FASD and is characterized by a pattern of minor facial anomalies, prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, and functional or structural central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. However, diagnosis of FAS in the infancy and early-childhood period is difficult and no clear criteria have been established for an early childhood diagnosis. The highest documented population prevalence of FAS in the world is 80 per 1,000 in themixed race population of theWestern Cape Province in South Africa. The consequences of FASD are lifelong, thus, early diagnosis and referral for early intervention services are imperative. However, while application of diagnostic guidelines for FASD in older children and adolescents can be difficult, diagnosis in the infant is rarely attempted because of the lack of documented specificity of the phenotype in the newborn. Yet, identification and referral within the first few months of lifemay represent the most crucial time in the affected child's life for initiation of early intervention services. A collaborative team of researchers from Stellenbosch University, The University of North Carolina, Sanford Research and The University of New Mexico have been following children from the newborn period to 60 months of age to determine the dysmorphology and developmental trajectories that characterize the alcoholexposed population in this stage of life (N=140). We are using three methodologies to approach this issue: growth and standardized dysmorphology assessment of subjects and controls at birth, 6 weeks, and 9 18, 42 and 60 months respectively; standardized developmental assessments (using age appropriate assessment tools) at the same intervals; and digital photography at each interval. This poster will present the results of our study of the children up to 18 months of age. The results consistently show slower developmental progress among alcohol-exposed children and variable dysmorphology over the time increments. Examination of the cohort continues at the above regular time intervals until the children reach the age of 60 months.

N2  - We and others have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure alters cellular 5-methylcytocine (5mC) during neurogenesis (Zhou et al., 2012), as well as the new formof DNA methylation 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (Chen et al., 2013). Here we investigated a potential role of 5mC and 5hmC on chromatin remodeling during neural development and how the prenatal alcohol exposure affected the two forms of DNA methylation and their sequelae. Methods: C57BL/6J pregnant mice were treated with 4%v/v alcohol liquid diet (Alc), isocaloric pairfed (PF) liquid diet, or ad lib Chow (Chow) from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E17. Their brains were harvested at E17 and postnatal day (P)7, analyzed immunocytochemically with 5mC, 5hmC, DNA methylation binding protein(MeCp2) and chromatin modification marks for colocalization in the cortical plate and dentate gyrus using fluorescent confocalmicroscopy. The co-localization was determined by Pearson's coefficient(r). Results: We found that 5mC and 5hmC were initially diffusely distributed in the nuclei of immature cortical neuron (E17) with high colocalization (r=0.60+/-0.06), but became distinctively distributed in different chromatin compartments (r=0.22+/-0.06) and differentially associated with varying chromatin states in mature cortical neurons at P7. The 5mC-im distributed mainly in DAPI-dense aggregates of heterochromatin regions and the 5hmC-im distributed in DAPI-sparse euchromatic regions. Alcohol partially prevented the programmed separation of 5mC and 5hmC in P7 cortical neurons (r=0.32+/-0.08). Furthermore, we found that the 5hmC became preferentially associated with activating histone H3K4me2 (r=0.87+/-0.01) and RNA polymerase II (r=0.57+/-0.01), while 5mC associated with repressive histone H3K9me3 (r=0.76+/-0.01) and H3K27me3 (r=0.61+/-0.02). Alcohol significantly reduced the colocalization of 5hmC to H3K4me2 (r=0.72+/-0.02) in P7 dentate granule cells. The MeCP2 preferentially co-localized with 5mC (r=0.82+/-0.01) than to 5hmC (r=0.30+/-0.02) in P7 cortical neurons. Alcohol significantly reduced the colocalization of MeCP2 with 5mC (r=0.70+/-0.03), as well as MeCp2 with 5hmC (r=0.19+/-0.02). Conclusion: These findings suggested that alcohol affected the development-related programming of the two DNA methylation marks and their associated chromatin modifiers.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt development, leading to physical, neuropathological, and cognitive disorders. In a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), these effects can be reduced by treatment with choline, a precursor in the one-carbon metabolic cycle that generates s-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). DNA methyltransferases require SAMas a methyl donor for de novo cytosine methylation, and choline supplementation alters local and global DNA cytosine methylation patterns. To better understand cellular responses to ethanol in the developing nervous system, and how these responses might be mitigated by choline, rat prefrontal cortices were studied. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups in a 2 (EtOH, sham) x 2 (choline chloride, vehicle) design. Alcohol (5.25 g/kg/day) was administered by intragastric intubation at postnatal days (PD) 4-9; choline (100 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection at PD 4-30. Tissue was collected on PD 31. The early (PD 4-9) postnatal development of the rat brain models the third trimester of human fetal brain development. Methylated DNA from prefrontal cortex tissue was captured by a methyl binding protein approach (ActiveMotif Methyl Collector Ultra). Greater than 200 million DNA fragments were sequenced for each group and methylome features analyzed using the CLC Bio Genome Workbench (version 6.5b3). Results: Comparing global DNA methylation patterns by scatter, Q-Q, volcano plots, antibodybased fluorescent assays, and LINE-1 pyrosequencing, we observed high correlation between treatment groups. However, when we queried genomic regions 10 kilobases upstream and downstream of the transcriptome transcription start site, we identified hypermethylated and hypomethylated loci in the different treatment groups. Using a modified gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to group changes in genic DNA methylation into molecular pathways, we detected alcohol-induced and choline-modified DNAmethylation changes at genes involved in acetylcholine signaling, retinoidmetabolism, and others. Discussion: This genomic view of brain methylome in the developing rat exposed to alcohol and choline suggests an important role for retinoid signaling in FASD, and also implicates several other gene networks. These data identify genetic targets through which prenatal alcohol might alter development, as well as choline's modification of gene expression.

N2  - Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) exerts devastating effects on the CNS, which vary as a function of both ethanol load and gestational age of exposure. A growing body of evidence suggests that alcohol exposure profoundly impacts a wide range of cytokines and other inflammatory-related genes in the CNS. The olfactory system serves as a critical interface between infectious/inflammatory signals and other aspects of CNS function, and demonstrates long-lasting plasticity in response to alcohol exposure. We therefore utilized gene expression profiling via microarray analysis to identify gene expression patterns for immune-related gene families in the olfactory bulb. To do this, pregnant dams received either an ad libitum liquid diet containing 35%daily calories from ethanol (ET), a pair-fed diet (PF), or free choice (FCL) access to the liquid diet and water fromGestational Day (GD) 11-20. Offspring were fostered to dams fed a standard lab chow diet, weaned on PND21, and then housed with same-sex littermates until mid-adolescence (P40) or young adulthood (P90). At the target ages of P40 or P90, offspring were euthanized via brief CO2 exposure and brains/blood were collected. Gene expression microarrays were performed using a Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix) and preliminary analyses focused on two moderately overlapping gene clusters, including all immune-related genes (a total of 1473 genes) and those related to neuroinflammation and vascular function (283 genes examined). Use of a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery revealed a total of 146 genes significantly affected by prenatal Diet condition, whereas Age of subject (P40 vs P90) revealed 998 genes significantly changed, and the interaction between Diet and Age yielded 162 significant genes. From this dataset, we applied a threshold of 1.3 fold change (30%increase or decrease in expression) for inclusion in later analyses. Using this approach, 7 candidate genes were significantly decreased after PAE (at P40: Chi3 l3, Nr4a1, Nr4a3; at P90: S100a9, Prg2, Postn, Gcnt1), whereas 9 genes were increased at P90 (Dusp1, F2, Junb, Egr1, Chi3 l3, Nr4a3, Nr4a2, Nr4a1). Ongoing work is confirming these changes. These data may provide important insight into the relationship between immune-related signaling cascades and long-term changes in olfactory bulb function after PAE.

N2  - Microglia in the brain are activated by immune challenges, producing cytokines that can lead to neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammatory disturbances are emerging as a critical player in disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Schizophrenia, depression, and autism. Importantly, cytokines are also involved in normal brain development, including neuronal migration, synaptogenesis, and synaptic pruning. Thus, abnormal cytokine levels during development may alter key neuronal processes, which could result in abnormal brain connectivity and increased vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. We hypothesized that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) would affect the developmental trajectory of microglia, resulting in altered cytokine expression.We investigated cytokine expression patterns in both blood and brain to answer the clinically relevant question of whether circulating cytokine levels provide insight into expression patterns in the brain. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams were assigned to: PAE-ad libitum access to a liquid ethanol diet (36%EtOH-derived calories); Pair-fed (PF)-liquid control diet,maltose-dextrin isocalorically substituted for EtOH in the amount consumed by a PAE partner; or Control (C)-ad libitum access to control diet. Levels of 11 cytokines were examined on postnatal days (PND): 0, 8, and 22. Preliminary data suggest a mismatch between cytokine expression patterns in blood and brain in terms of both cytokines expressed and the direction of effects. At PND8, circulating levels of pro-(IFN- and TNF-a), and anti-inflammatory (IL-13) cytokines were significantly higher in PAE, compared to controls. Comparatively, in the brain, levels of pro-(IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4) cytokines were significantly lower in PAE compared to controls. Interestingly, at PND22, IFN- showed heightened expression in blood and concurrently dampened expression in brains of PAE animals, further exemplifying the mismatch between blood and brain. Our preliminary results indicate that patterns of cytokine expression differ in PAE animals in a development-and compartment-specific manner. PAE animals display heightened cytokine expression in the blood, perhaps indicative of underlying low-grade inflammation, but dampened cytokine expression in the brain, which may have important consequences for brain development.

N2  - Insult to the CNS is accompanied by a graded response in which glia become activated. The molecular and phenotypic changes in activated microglia are increasingly understood and can now be applied to better understand the consequences of alcohol consumption. Maternal consumption of alcohol can lead to widespread neuropathology in the developing fetal brain. Using the neonatal mousemodel of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), characterized by significant neuronal loss and long term behavioral deficits, we previously demonstrated that microglia are highly vulnerable targets of ethanol pathogenesis in the developing brain. Specifically, ethanol exposure causes loss of microglial cells and the surviving microglia express morphological changes suggestive of microglial activation and neuroinflammation. In addition, we demonstrated that neuroprotective and antiinflammatory pharmaceutical PPAR-c agonists can block ethanol pathogenesis in both neurons and microglia. The present study analyzed cytokine and chemokine expression in this model to determine both the graded stage and molecular consequences of ethanol-induced microglial activation in the developing brain. Further, we determined whether treatment with the PPAR-c agonist pioglitazone would prevent ethanol-induced pathogenic changes in gene expression. Mice were treated with 4 g/kg ethanol by gavage on postnatal days (PD) 4-9. Animals received either water or pioglitazone by gavage on PD3-9. On PD10, animals were perfused to remove blood from the brain vasculature and the brain was microdissected. Analysis of gene expression revealed that ethanol induced expression of IL-1beta, TNF-a, and CCL2 (MCP-1) mRNA in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Treatment with pioglitazone completely prevented the ethanol-induced increase in cytokine and chemokine expression. These findings shed light on an important new potential mechanism underlying the neuropathology of FASD. First, expression of these specific cytokines and chemokines indicates that ethanol exposure in the developing brain produces a stage of microglial activation associated with major CNS insult and neurodegeneration. Second, these molecules are pro-inflammatory, as well as neurotoxic and gliotoxic, and thus likely contribute to the neuropathology of FASD. Finally, the FDA-approved pharmaceutical agent pioglitazone holds promise to intervene in the neuropathological consequences of FASD.

N2  - Lifelong social behavior deficits can serve as a unifying feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Social behavior deficits following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) becomemore pronounced prior to and during adolescence, a critical period of social behavior development. PAE is known to reprogram the stress systemsuch that PAE offspring are hyper-responsive to stressors, and exhibit increased drive and deficits in feedback. The functional relationship between the stress system and brain areas important for regulating social behavior suggests that alterations to the stress system are a source of observed PAE-related social behavior deficits. We investigated social behavior using a test of social learning in PAE and control rats. Pregnant rat dams were assigned to: 1) PAE: access to liquid ethanol diet ad libitum; 2) Pair-Fed: access to liquid control diet yoked to consumption of a PAE partner; or 3) Control: access to control diet ad libitum. Periadolescent offspring (~P30) were evaluated using a social recognition test. The learning phase of the test involves four 2-min sessions (18-min intertrial interval) during which the same social stimulus is introduced into the testing apparatus. A fifth, 2-min session with a novel social stimulus serves as the test phase. Time spent in investigation and specific social behaviors were recorded. Blood was collected for analysis of the stress hormone corticosterone and corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG). Preliminary data indicate PAE males show impairments in social recognition. Animals habituated to the familiar social stimulus, as measured by decreases in latency to initiate play over the learning phase. PAE males showed no change in latency to initiate play with the novel social stimulus, whereas control males showed a significant increase in play latency. PAE animals also showed divergent patterns of play behavior. These results demonstrate that PAE alters social recognition memory in early adolescence andmodifies normal social behavior. Additionally, we found no difference in levels of corticosterone, though increased levels of CBG were observed in PAE and Pair-Fed animals, indicating less free corticosterone in these animals and altered HPA activity. Changes in the stress system may underlie some of the social behavior deficits observed in PAE animals.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure may cause, in addition to a range of physical, cognitive, neurological, and behavioral deficits, changes to physiology. In particular, alcohol exposure in utero dysregulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Short-term activation of the HPA axis is adaptive, but persistent elevation of basal HPA tone or an inability to shut off the stress response in a timely manner have maladaptive consequences on health and wellbeing. The impact of prenatal alcohol-induced changes in HPA regulation on stress responsivity later in life needs further investigation. To examine the effects of HPA dysregulation by prenatal alcohol exposure on behavior in novel and stressful contexts following chronic mild stress (CMS), adult offspring from 1) alcohol-fed (PAE; 36% ethanolderived calories); 2) pairfed (PF); and 3) ad libitum-fed control (C) underwent sham surgery or adrenalectomy with corticosterone replacement (ADX+CORT) at low basal levels (25 lg/ml in males; 75 lg/ml in females) in drinking water. Following recovery, animals were either exposed to CMS or left undisturbed (non-CMS). Animals were then tested successively in the open field and elevated plus maze (EPM) to evaluate behavior in novel environments, and then in themodified Porsolt forced swim test (FST) to assess coping behavior in a high stress context. Plasma samples were collected 30-min post-FST for assessing stress CORT levels. Preliminary data show that in the EPM, prenatal alcohol exposure increases open arm exploration in bothmale and female non-CMS sham animals. CMS reduces open armexploration only in PAE sham females to control levels. ADX+CORT eliminates differences among males only. In a high stress context (e.g. FST), PAE sham animals with prior CMS exposure show, in a sex-dependent manner, different immobility behavior than respective control counterparts. ADX+CORT increases immobility of PAE CMS males, but eliminates differences among females. CORT levels in response to the FST are not significantly different among groups in both sexes. Overall, preliminary results suggest that, depending on the behavioral task and in a sex-dependent manner, prenatal alcohol exposure alters the behavioral response to CMS as compared to controls, and HPA dysregulation may contribute to PAE-induced behavioral alterations.

N2  - Recent experiments in our laboratory indicate that moderate fetal ethanol exposure(FAE) results in reductions in measures of dendritic morphology in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. The current experiments were undertaken to further establish a link between FAE, structure and function in the NAc, and voluntary alcohol consumption in adulthood. Moderate FAE was achieved using a two-bottle choice voluntary consumption paradigm. Dams received either 0 or 5%ethanol in saccharin throughout gestation, resulting in blood ethanol concentrations around 82 mg/dL. At sixmonths of age, male offspring were individually housed and given 4-hour access to two bottles containing either 20%ethanol or tap water. Immediately following ethanol consumption, rats were sacrificed and NActissue was processed for either immediate-early gene expression or Golgi-Cox staining. Using RT-PCR, the expression ofc-fos, Arc, and Homer1a were measured. No significant effects were found for Arc or c-fos expression in either the NAc core or shell between FAE and saccharinexposed control rats. There was a significant reduction in Homer1a expression in the NAc core, but not the shellof FAE rats. It was also found that NAc core Arc expression was negatively correlated with ethanol consumption in saccharin controls, but not in FAE animals.Measures of dendritic morphology found significant reductions in the core and shell for dendritic branching and length, as well as reduced spine density, in FAE rats. Reductions in the shell for all animals and in the core for FAE rats predicted ethanol consumption, with reduced dendritic branching associated with increased ethanol consumption. Two further experiments found no significant differences between FAE and control rats for ethanol metabolismor general reward learning using an operant intracranial selfstimulation paradigm. These results suggest that alcohol consumption by adult rats exposed tomoderate levels of ethanol in utero may lead to structural and functional alterations in the NAc core, and that these changes, combined with pre-existing deficits in the NAc shell,may partially explain the deficits in reward-guided learning and behavior in these animals.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can result in enduring severe cognitive deficits and characteristic facial features. A growing body of literature suggests that even moderate PAE can result in long lasting cognitive deficits exemplified in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, including impairments in learning and memory, social behavior and executive function. Executive function describes a broad range of cortically mediated behaviors including behavioral flexibility, which has been shown to be a sensitive and reliablemeasure across species. High dose of PAE has been shown to impair flexible behavior, but the effects of moderate PAE on this cognitive process have not been examined. Further, themechanisms that underlie the executive function deficits associated with FASD are still unclear. In order to investigate the effects of moderate PAE on executive control, we utilized a voluntary drinking paradigm where dams had access to a saccharine sweetened 10%alcohol solution for 4 hours, during the dark cycle, throughout gestation. Pups of alcohol and saccharine only (SAC) exposed dams were then tested on a visual pair-wise discrimination reversal touch-screen operant task during adulthood. PAE animals were not impaired in discriminative learning, butmade significantly more perseverative errors during choice shifting in the early phase of reversal (<20% correct). Further analysis of perseverative errors during early reversal revealed differences in the length of time spent in the perseverative phase between PAE and SAC mice. Across species reversal learning is mediated by orbital frontal cortex (OFC), therefore, we performed in vivo electrophysiology in the OFC of PAE and SACmice to examine whether alterations in cortical firing may underlie the behavioral deficit. Results showed a difference in phasic firing in the OFC of PAE animals specifically during early reversal, when choice shifting is occurring. Given the well-established role of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in synaptic plasticity and previous work showing alterations ofNMDAR subunits in the hippocampus after PAE, we are currently investigating if alterations in NMDA receptor function and expression are possiblemechanisms behind the alteration in cortical firing. Together our data demonstrate a long lasting impairment in executive function after moderate PAE that may result from alterations in cortical firing.

N2  - Prenatal ethanol exposures produce long-term suppression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and its peptide products beta-endorphin and alpha-MSH in the hypothalamus to produce abnormalities in neuroendocrine and immune functions.We have recently identified that the reduced POMC gene expression in the hypothalamus is associated with increased DNA methylation of the proximal POMC promoter as well as elevated levels of methyl CpG binding protein (MeCP2) in beta-endorphin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus. The molecular mechanism for alcohol regulation of POMC gene expression is not clearly understood. In this study, we determined whether promoter hypermethylation causes gene silencing by recruiting MeCP2 on to the promoter of POMC gene. MeCP2 is a transcriptional regulator that binds to the methylated cytosines at CpG dinucleotides, binding ofMeCP2 to the proximal part of promoter is often associated with recruitment of gene silencing complex and subsequent down regulation of the gene expression in neurons.We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to identify the location of MeCP2 binding sites on the POMC promoter in arcuate area of rat hypothalamus.We also evaluated whether MeCP2 knock down enhances POMC expression in fetal alcohol exposed rat offspring. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were fed between GD7 and 21 with a liquid diet containing 6.7%alcohol (AF), pair-fed with isocaloric liquid diet (PF), or fed ad libitum with rat chow (AD). 60-day old male offspring rats were used for the experiments. ChIP analysis of the chromatin isolated from the arcuate area of the offspring of AF, PF and AD dams showed increased MeCP2 binding in proximal POMC promoter of AF as compared to AD and PF animals. We used lentiviral delivery of MeCP2 shRNA into the third ventricle to knock down MeCP2 expression in POMC neurons. Lentiviral delivery of MeCP2 shRNA efficiently reduced MeCP2mRNA and protein levels in the mediobasal hypothalamus of all treatment group. MeCP2 shRNA treatment suppressed fetal alcohol-induced increase in POMC methylation. The treatment also normalizes the fetal alcohol induced suppressive effect on POMC gene expression. These data provide support to the concept that DNA hypermethylation of POMC promoter caused by prenatal alcohol exposure leads to elevated MeCP2 binding on the POMC promoter and subsequent down regulation of POMC gene expression in the hypothalamus.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol SpectrumDisorders (FASD) are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) and believed responsible for the majority of developmental disabilities in the U.S. Our objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral for Treatment (SBIRT) interventionmay reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) women in Southern California. Southern California AI/AN women of childbearing age completed a survey including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use, were randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former completed an on-line SBIRT intervention, and were followed-up at 1, 3, and 6 months post-intervention. of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, a third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior and risk of AEP in the followup period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Factors associated with decreased risk included the baseline perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per week, a greater number of binge episodes in the past two weeks, and depression. Participation in this study may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the web-based intervention. The importance of perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/ functionality have implications for future interventions.

N2  - According to the WHO, Russia has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world and increasingly hazardous drinking among women. Research studies indicate that many women in Russia believe that alcohol use is harmless and can be beneficial for health and a significant proportion of Russian women are at risk for alcohol exposed pregnancies (AEP). This presentation if focused on identifying characteristics of women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies in the NNR, Russia. A subset of data froma larger study aimed at developing FASD prevention in Russia is used for this study (1). Objectives: to identify socio-demographic characteristics of childbearing age women who drink at risk for AEP; to describe the women's attitudes about alcohol consumption by other; to identify personality characteristics of childbearing age women who drink at risk for AEP. Method: Data from childbearing age women (N=360) at risk for AEP were recruited for a larger study, a randomized controlled clinical trial, in NNR were used for this study to identify characteristics of women at risk for AEP in NNR. The survey included demographic questions (living environment, marital status, education, employment, age, ethnicity), questions about family planning/contraception, alcohol consumptionmeasures, and some questions about emotions, self-control. Results: Analysis of socio-demographic characteristics of women showed that some characteristics including residence (rural vs urban), age, and having a child/children affected women's consumption. Women living in small towns who were between 23 to 44 years of age were consuming more alcohol compared to other study participants. Women who had children were drinking less than their childless counterparts.Women who reported higher levels of alcohol consumption reportedmore intense emotions, emotional instability, and lower self-control. Conclusions: Childbearing age women who reside in small cities in NNR consumed more alcohol compared to younger women and those who lived in rural areas.Women who had a child/children were drinking less compare to women who did not have children. Women's personal characteristics including their attitudes toward drinking during pregnancy, emotional instability, lower self-control, and some other were associated with drinking larger amounts of alcohol.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a broad term used to describe individuals exposed prenatally to alcohol and encompasses a broad range of birth defects including facial abnormalities and learning,motor, and behavioral deficits. Despite promoting alcohol abstinence during pregnancy, the incidenceof FASD has failed to declineand individuals lackingcardinal facial abnormalities and historical exposure are increasingly difficult to identify. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is readily available, provides superior brain contrast, and in previous human studies of FASD hasshownsignificant volume reductions in various brain structures.We hypothesize that postnatal MRI derived volumetric brain measurements can predict prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant ewes received 2.5 g/kg alcohol (N=8) IV three consecutive days per week fromgestation day 4-41 (mimicking a binge drinking pattern in the first trimester of pregnancy) while remaining ewes were controls (N=7). Lambs were sacrificed at 6 months of age, their brains were perfused with fixative, and MRI's were performed immediately post mortem.T1-weighted images were used to calculate cerebellar and pituitary volume(ITK-SNAP software, Version 2.4.0). Corrected mean cerebellar volume to total brain weight in controls(10.03+/-0.2328 g) was significantly different from the alcohol group (9.27+/-0.1305 g) (p<0.05) while corrected mean pituitary volume to total brain weight in controls (207.44+/-26.25 g) did not differ significantly from the alcohol group (180.63+/-8.106 g) (p=0.3175). TheseMRI findings differ fromour previous workutilizing stereological methods on the fetal cerebellumand the same first trimester alcohol exposure. The total estimated cerebellar Purkinje cell number andPurkinje cell density decreased significantlyin the alcohol group compared to thecontrol group but no significant differences existed between cerebellar volumes. Findings in the pituitary are consistent with previous rodent literature in which no significant volume differences were identified. Pituitary volume is therefore a poor predictor of first trimester alcohol exposureat this alcohol dose and pattern in sheep, but MRI derived volumetric measures of the cerebellum or other brain structures may be beneficial and further studies are warranted.

N2  - Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) is a direct ethanolmetabolite which has emerged as a useful biomarker of ethanol consumption. Analysis of PEth in dry blood spot (DBS) cards is highly promising due to the minimal invasiveness and ease of storage and transportation. DBS cards are routinely collected from more than 95%of the newborns in the United States and can offer a unique opportunity to assess prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). However, whether or not banked DBS cards can be analyzed to confirm PAE in a child suspected of Fetal Alcohol SpectrumDisorder is unclear. This prospective study is examining the long-term stability of PEth in DBS cards under different storage conditions. DBS cards were collected from patients with a history of alcohol abuse/dependence admitted to the University of New Mexico Emergency Department. Aliquots of whole blood obtained by phlebotomy at admission/triage were analyzed for blood alcohol content (BAC) and pipetted onto three Guthrie cards, which were later stored at three temperature conditions (roomtemperature, 4degree C, and-80degreeC). The first blood spot, used as a baseline measure, was analyzed within a week of collection by LC/MS/MS to determine a PEth baseline concentration. To date, DBS cards from 23 patients stored for two months at either room and the 4degreeC temperature conditions have been re-analyzed. The mean baseline PEth concentration was 630+/-540 ng/mL. The absolute and the percent change in PEth concentration at the two-month follow-up were calculated for each temperature condition and compared by aWilcoxon signed-rank test. The preliminary results indicated that the PEth concentration significantly declined over two months in DBS cards stored at either room temperature (-295+/-282 ng/mL; 44% decline) or 4degreeC (-292+/-274 ng/mL; 43%decline). No difference between the two temperature conditions was observed for absolute or percentage change in PEth over two months. These data suggest that while the PEth concentration significantly declined over two months, no difference between the two storage conditions was observed. Ongoing analyses will evaluate PEth degradation over longer storage times and at-80degreeC.

N2  - Early detection of alcohol use among pregnant women is critical to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Maternal self-reporting is largely unreliable and the utility of current biomarkers is also limited during pregnancy. Based on alcohol's complex effects on the transferrin N-glycans including loss of sialic acids, partial loss of sugars, and/or complete loss of oligosaccharide chains, we herein utilized state of the art mass spectrometry to characterize the sequences and abundances of maternal plasma transferrin N-linked oligosaccharides preserving the location of the N-glycosite in a pregnant rat binge alcohol paradigm model. We utilized a once-daily binge alcohol exposure paradigm (4 or 6 g/kg ethanol, intragastric gavage) for two weeks till gestational day 20. Blood sample (200 ll) was drawn into a heparinized vial at peak blood alcohol concentration time, plasma separated and utilized formass spectrometric studies. Protein identification and sequence mapping was followed by glycopeptide identification using the diagnostic fragmentation spectra. Absolute glycopeptide quantitation was performed. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed the composition, sequences, and abundances of rat maternal plasma transferrin N-linked oligosaccharides preserving the location of the N-glycosite. The abundances of several N-linked oligosaccharides were dosedependently altered with knock out of some moieties at the higher alcohol dose. These studies may pave way for developing highly sensitive protein post-translational modification signature profile directly relating to the dose and duration of exposure. We believe that these novelmethodologies can be in the future extended to pregnant women and form the basis for a high throughput screening tool that will help establish a standardized diagnostic criteria with a real clinical impact not only in diagnosis but also in treatment and prevention.

N2  - This study is a collaboration between theMotherisk Program and the University of British Columbia School of Population and Public Health, which collected meconium samples in Uganda to measure the prevalence of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during pregnancy. The focus of our study is to measure the frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure by meconium fatty-acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) analysis. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) describes a range of lifelong neurodevelopment impairments originating frommaternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Recent studies determined that of the Ugandan women who drank regularly prior to pregnancy, 18.3%reported abstinence, 68.3% decreased alcohol consumption, whereas an astonishing 11.1%reported increases in alcohol consumption. The number of FASD cases in parts of sub-Saharan Africa has been increasing, which is a cause for concern due to the socio-economic impact. The increase in FASD cases may be linked to the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy (2.2%-87%). FAEEs have served as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. Meconiumwas collected from 505 newborns between October-November 2013 atMbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Each meconium sample was attached to a questionnaire, which contained maternal and neonatal information. The questionnaires will serve as the maternal self-report for alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The criterion used to describe a positivemeconium FAEE test, which confirms excessive alcohol consumption during 2nd and/or 3rd trimester, are when the total FAEE concentration (sum of ethyl palmitate, oleate, stearate and linoleate concentrations) is greater than 2 nmol/g. All samples are analyzed by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction followed by GC/MS analyses. Meconium FAEE analysis is currently ongoing at Motherisk Laboratory. The identification of specific populations (i.e. Uganda) in need of basic epidemiologic research on the prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure is urgently required in order to create awareness and reduce the devastation of FASD.

Maternal hair might allow for a retrospectivemeasure of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) for up to severalmonths. Prior studies yieldedmixed results with respect to the utility of hair EtG (hEtG) in pregnant women. This study examined the validity of hEtG relative to self-reporting and five other biomarkers (gamma glutamyltranspeptidase [GGT], carbohydrate-deficient transferrin [CDT], urine ethyl glucuronide [uEtG], urine ethyl sulfate [uEtS], and phosphatidylethanol [PEth]) in 103 pregnant women. Patients were recruited from a UNM prenatal clinic and followed until the early postpartum period. The composite index, which was based on self-reported measures of alcohol use and allowed us to classify subjects into PAE (n=47) and control (n=56) groups, was the criterion measure used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of hEtG and other biomarkers. Proximal segments of hair were collected at enrollment (average 21.0 gestational weeks) and sent to a contract laboratory for analysis by LCMS/ MS. At the same visit,maternal specimens were collected for analysis of GGT and%dCDTin serum, urine EtG and EtS (uEtG, uEtS), and whole blood PEth. The pregnant population included a large proportion of ethnic minorities (76.7%Latina, 9.7% Native American, 3.9%African American) who were socially disadvantaged (51.5%< high school education; 99% Medicaid/no health insurance). Themeanmaternal age at recruitment was 26.6+/-5.1 years. Hair EtG demonstrated a 19.2%sensitivity and 87.5%specificity. The sensitivities of other biomarkers were comparable (6.7-20.0%) to hEtG in this cohort, but specificities were higher (98.2-100%). Of the five subjects positive for three or more biomarkers at enrollment, only two had hEtG levels greater than the limit of detection, and those concentrations were low (8 and 13 pg/mg). Mothers of two children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome had hEtG levels of 158 and 58 pg/mg. Combining hEtG with other biomarkers resulted in a substantial increase in the sensitivity to 44.7%with a slight decrease in specificity to 80.4%.These data suggest that given its lower specificity compared with other ethanol biomarkers, hEtG should not be used as a sole biomarker for identification of prenatal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol SpectrumDisorder (FASD) is an umbrella term used to describe the range of disabilities and diagnoses that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure. While alcohol teratogenesis generally results in diffuse brain alterations, the functional patterns of disability that result seem to vary patient to patient. To our knowledge, no actual data exists from more than specific research studies or single clinical programs that note the frequency of each co-occurring functional disorder nor identifies the common clusters of functional disorders. Similarly, diagnostic clinics may makemany treatment recommendations at the end of the FASD assessment process for health, mental health, social services, education, and others, but there has not been any published work that informs the ability to make meaningful interpretations of the diagnoses and disorders, as well as tomake recommendations for the most effective interventions. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop a database that would enable the collection of FASD diagnostic data across Canada in order to analyze and clearly document the common problems-and recommended treatments-associated with FASD. Importantly, the universal data form project provides a platform for standardized data collection. Methods: The data form was developed using a set of common forms and data was collected from over 30 participating FASD diagnostic teams in Canada. To date, the FASDataform Project has captured over 350 client records and initial data analysis reveals interesting patterns of functional diagnoses. The top three functional deficits were in the areas of adaptive behaviour (83%), executive function and abstract reasoning (81%), and social Communication (78%). The most frequent patterns of functional deficits were 'academic achievement, executive function, communication' (58%) and 'cognition, Executive function and Adaptive behaviour' (58%). Variations among provincial experiences and atypical functional clusters will also be discussed. Conclusion: This is the first clinical dataset for FASD that has provided identification of trends and modalities related to prevention, prevalence and diagnosis of FASD across jurisdictional lines. This data accurately reflects the pan-Canadian FASD diagnostic clinical experience. These data can be used for reporting, research and surveillance; as well as informing best practices and policy.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancymay lead to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Although models of IUGR exhibit altered uterine vascular adaptations, nothing is known about the effects of alcohol on uterine artery reactivity. We herein hypothesized that chronic binge-alcohol exposure during pregnancy impairs uterine vascular adaptations via the nitric oxide (NO) vasodilatory system. A chronic once daily binge alcohol paradigm was followed in the rats (6 g/kg; intragastric gavage; gestation day (GD) 5-19). Experiments were conducted on GD 20. A significant reduction in fetal whole body weight and crown-rump length was observed following alcohol exposure. Alcohol did not alter uterine artery contractility in response to a1 adrenergic agonist phenylephrine and thromboxane or vasodilatory response to endothelium-independent sodium-nitroprusside. Alcohol selectively impaired endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-induced uterine vascular relaxation (EMax, Ctrl, 94.7+/-1.6; Alc, 69.7+/-1.7; p<0.001). Alcohol-induced Ach-mediated impaired vasorelaxation was due to NO pathway because addition of inhibitors of prostacyclin and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor activity demonstrated a significant NO component (EMax, Ctrl, 65.8+/-2.4; Alc, 47.3+/-1.4; p<0.001). Addition of NO-related inhibitors (L-NAME and ODQ) validated the effects of alcohol on uterine NO system. Alcohol decreased the levels of amajor endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) excitatory site Pser1177eNOS (p<0.05) compared to the normal and pair-fed Ctrls, whereas alcohol significantly increased the levels of a major eNOS inhibitory site Pthr495eNOS (p<0.001). Total eNOS was significantly decreased in the alcohol group compared to the normal and pair-fed Ctrls (p<0.001). These data show that chronic binge alcohol impairs uterine vascular adaptations during pregnancy. Alcohol specifically impairs endothelium-dependent NO-mediated vasodilation via its effects on specific excitatory and inhibitory eNOS multi-site phosphorylation sites. These data underscore the importance ofmaternal uterine vascular adaptations in the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to an array of neurobehavioral consequences. One such consequence is altered stress reactivity.We have established a mouse model of PAE that displays a spectrum of morphological and behavioral alterations, reflective of what is seen in individuals with Fetal Alcohol SpectrumDisorders. Previously established, these mice display a hyperactive stress response as measured by increased corticosterone levels after restraint stress. More recently, we further showed that they have increased anxiety as evident by decreased time spent in the light side of a light-dark box. Because behavioral assessments of stress reactivity are often difficult to interpret on their own, we sought to extend these behavioral observations to amore readily defined physiological approach. Therefore, in an effort to better understand the hyperactive stress response in PAE mice, manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) was employed. This technique allows identification of brain regions that are differentially activated during exposure to a stimulus, such as a stressor. MEMRI signal intensity derives from activity-dependent intracellular accumulation of Mn2+ through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Due to the amount of time needed for Mn2+ to diffuse throughout the entire brain, the MEMRI technique can be technically challenging when applied to studies using an acute stimulus. For this study, we systemically injected control and PAE mice with 70 mg/kg MnCl2 and 4 hrs later exposed them to 15 min of restraint stress. Mice were then imaged 1 hr later on a 9.4T MRI. Using an atlas-based approach to segment a number of brain regions, we were able to study region-specific activity resulting from acute stress. Data indicate that the protocol that we have established is appropriate for assessment of acute stress effects as signal enhancement is seen specifically in regions, such as the central nucleus of the amygdala and paraventricular nucleus, that are known to be activated by acute stress. In conclusion, application of the MEMRI technique appears to be a highly promising functional approach for the study of the physiological consequences of PAE.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a multitude of neurological problems in offspring, varying from subtle behavioral changes to severe mental retardation. These alterations are collectively referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Early alcohol exposure can strongly affect the visual system and children with FASD can exhibit an amblyopia-like pattern of vision acuity defects even in the absence of optical and oculomotor disruptions. Here we test whether early alcohol exposure can lead to a disruption in visual acuity, using a mousemodel of FASD to mimic alcohol consumption in the last months of human gestation. To accomplish this, mice were exposed to ethanol (5 g/kg i.p.) or saline on postnatal days (P) 5, 7 and 9. Two to three weeks later, we recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to assess spatial frequency detection and contrast sensitivity, conducted electroretinography (ERG) to further assess visual function, and imaged retinotopy using optical imaging of intrinsic signals.We observed that animals exposed to ethanol displayed spatial frequency acuity curves similar to controls. However, ethanol treated animals showed a significant deficit in contrast sensitivity. Moreover, ERGs revealed a marked decrease in both a-and b-wave amplitudes, and optical imaging suggested that the elevationmaps of the primary visual cortex in ethanol treated animals have a 20-30degree difference in map tilt compared to saline controls. Overall, our findings suggest that binge alcohol drinking restricted to the lastmonths of gestation can lead to marked deficits in visual function.

N2  - Ethanol causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders partly by inhibiting adhesion mediated by the L1 neural cell adhesion molecule.We showed previously that L1 sensitivity to ethanol requires phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 substrate S1248 on the L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1-CD). Here we show that L1 sensitivity to ethanol also requires phosphorylation of Y1176 in the L1-CD by Src family kinase (SFK). Inhibition of phosphorylation using the SFK inhibitors PP2 or AZD0530 did not inhibit L1 adhesion but abolished ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion. Replacement of L1-Y1176 with leucine, which cannot be phosphorylated, also abolished ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion without altering L1 adhesion in the absence of ethanol.We used antibody 74-5H7, which recognizes only the dephosphorylated state of L1-Y1176 to show that clonal, ethanol-sensitive L1-expressing NIH/3T3 cells have higher levels of Y1176 phosphorylation than ethanol-insensitive cells. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of L1-Y1176, like phosphorylation of L1-S1248, is necessary for ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion, and differences in phosphorylation of Y1176 might also account for differences in sensitivity to ethanol among different cells. To learn whether differential phosphorylation of L1-Y1176 is associated with differential sensitivity to ethanol teratogenesis, wemeasured L1-1176 phosphorylation in embryonic day-10 embryos from C57BL/6 J and C57BL/6 N mice. Prvious studies have shown that prenatal ethanol exposure causes a higher incidence of ocular defects in C57BL/6 J mice than in C57BL/6 N mice, in this study we found that phosphorylation of L1-1176 is higher in C57BL/6 J mice than in C57BL/6 N mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that phosphorylation of multiple sites in the L1-CD is necessary for ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion, and that constitutive differences in phosphorylation of the L1-CD phosphorylation partly determine the susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis. Genes that encode proteins that regulate the phosphorylation of these sites might, therefore, be susceptibility genes for FASD.

N2  - Alcohol drinking inflicts a broad spectrum of consequences, which range fromundetectable effects to severe dysmorphology, growth retardation and neurodevelopmental deficits, which lead to diverse neurological abnormalities and psychosocial disabilities that are independent of dosage and stage of alcohol exposure. Can the genetic background contribute to such diversified phenotypic outcomes? The presence of several differential alcohol vulnerabilities among mouse strains, including C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2), support this hypothesis by holding alcohol factors constant to rule out the innate or interactive gene 9 environment differences. Using embryonic B6 and D2 cultures to eliminate confounding factors produced by the maternal environment, we demonstrated that the fetal genetic background contributes to the observed differences in alcohol (300-400 mg/dl) vulnerability at the organ (e.g. brain, heart and eye) and cellular levels (e.g. apoptosis and neural stem cell differentiation). Further, to identify the genomic signatures of the B6 and D2 strains, we mapped the B6 and D2 genomes onto release 66 (NCBI37/mm9) of the M. musculus genome from Ensembl using CLC GenomicsWorkbench V4.7.We then overlaid our Affymetrix expression data to identify strainspecific, fixed genomic loci that are differentially influenced by alcohol.We identified over 100,000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between the two strains. Using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we found ~1200 differentially expressed genes between B6 and D2. Over 400 contained SNVs between the two lines, indicating potential cis-acting elements at these loci. Using two-factor analysis, we determined that 11/54 genes exhibiting differential responses to alcohol (5%FDR) contain SNVs. These include Eya2 (Eyes absent Homolog 2), Csmd3 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3), Tac2 (Tachykinin 2), Apold1 (Apolipoprotein L Domain Containing 1), Psme4 (Proteasome). These findings warrant further analysis of genetic contribution to alcohol susceptibility. A better understanding of the innate and GXE interactions will contribute significantly to the understanding of the mechanism and diversity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and further the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Recent attempts to identify a neurocognitive profile of children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have led to an emerging "generalized deficit" conceptualization marked by diffuse information processing and integration difficulties as opposed to a specific profile. This study examines whether this conceptualization can be extended to higher functioning children with PAE who are without intellectual disability and addresses several limitations of previous research. One hundred twenty-five children aged 6-12 years with social skills deficits, 97 of whom met diagnostic criteria for a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), underwent a comprehensive, multi-informant assessment of neurocognitive, emotional, social, behavioral, and adaptive functioning. Multivariate analyses of variance examined differences in functioning between the PAE group and a nonexposed comparison group with and without controlling for child IQ. Results indicated that the PAE group returned significantly poorer scores than the nonexposed group on every construct assessed, including executive functioning, attention, working/visuospatial memory, linguistic abstraction, adaptive behavior, emotional/behavioral functioning, and social cognition. These differences largely maintained after controlling for IQ and were similar regardless of informant, although teachers reported somewhat fewer group differences. Within the PAE group, no differences were found across FASD subtypes. These results provide evidence extending the emerging generalized deficit conceptualization of children with PAE to those higher functioning individuals without global intellectual disability. © 2013 The Author(s).

N2  - Background There is a growing need for validated tools to screen children at risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The Neurobehavioral Screening Tool (NST) is one of several promising screening measures for FASD, though further evidence is needed to establish the tool's psychometric utility. Objective To assess the predictive accuracy of the NST among children with an FASD diagnosis, with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but no FASD diagnosis, and typically developing controls. Method The NST was completed by caregivers of children ages 6 to 17, including 48 with FASD, 22 with PAE, and 32 typically developing non-exposed controls. Predictive accuracy coefficients were calculated using Nash et al. (2006) criteria, and compared against controls. An alternative scoring scheme was also investigated to determine optimum referral thresholds using item-level total scores. Results The NST yielded 62.5% sensitivity for participants with FASD and 50% for PAE. Specificity values were 100% with no typically developing control scoring positive. Within the FASD group there was a trend for higher sensitivity among adolescents aged 12 to17 (70.8%) compared with children aged 6 to 11 years (54.2%), p = 0.23. Conclusion The findings support a growing body of literature evidencing psychometric promise for the clinical utility of the NST as an FASD screening tool, though further research on possible age-effects is warranted. The availability of a validated clinical screening tool for FASD, such as the NST, would aid in accurately screening a large number of children and lead to a timelier diagnostic referral. © 2014 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

T1  - Prenatal testosterone increases sensitivity to prenatal stressors in males with disruptive behavior disorders

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) exhibit a sex-biased prevalence rate favoring boys, and prenatal testosterone exposure appears to be part of the complex etiology of these disorders. The current study examines whether high prenatal testosterone exposure may heighten the risk for DBD symptoms in males by increasing susceptibility to negative environmental conditions such as maternal nicotine and alcohol use during pregnancy. Participants were 109 three- to six-year-olds (64% male; 72% with DBD) and their 109 primary caregivers and 55 daycare providers/teachers who completed a multi-informant diagnostic procedure. A proxy of prenatal testosterone exposure, finger-length ratios, interacted with maternal report of prenatal nicotine use to predict teacher-rated hyperactivity-impulsivity during preschool, for boys, but not girls, although the three-way interaction was not significant. Prenatal testosterone interacted with prenatal alcohol exposure to predict teacher-rated hyperactivity-impulsivity and ODD symptoms differentially based on child sex (significant three-way interaction). Boys with higher levels of prenatal testosterone who were also exposed to higher levels of nicotine and alcohol during pregnancy exhibited increased hyperactivity-impulsivity during early childhood, but girls did not exhibit this same pattern. Thus, high prenatal testosterone exposure seems to increase risk for DBD symptoms particularly in males by increasing susceptibility to prenatal environmental stressors. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), characterized by significant changes in the physiology, structural plasticity of hippocampal function, including long-term deficits in learning and memory. Environmental enrichment has long been known to improve motor and cognitive function levels, causes several neurochemical and morphological alterations in the brain. Therefore, the effects of environmental enrichment on the neurobehavioral and neurotrophic changes in mice exposed prenatally to alcohol were investigated in this study. The pregnant dams were given 25 % ethanol (w/v) or isocaloric sucrose by liquid diet from gestation day 7 to 20. After weaning on postnatal day 28, offspring were exposed to standard cage (CC, CFAS) or enriched living conditions (CE, EFAS) for 8 weeks. Neurobehavioral studies both on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and place and cue learning strategy, a striatum-dependent test, were measured by the Morris water maze task. Moreover, the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was also used in order to study the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level in both the hippocampus and striatum of mice. Neurobehavioral studies show that animals exposed prenatally to alcohol were impaired as shown in both hippocampal-dependent spatial/ place and striatal-dependent response/cue learning tests. Moreover, the levels of BDNF expression both in the hippocampus and striatum of mice were also decreased. Interestingly, environmental enrichment can ameliorate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure both on the neurobehavioral and neurotrophic levels. These observations indicated that enriched environment attenuated memory impairment of prenatal alcohol exposure both in hippocampal and striatal circuitry.

N2  - Persistent deficits in social behavior are among the major negative consequences associated with exposure to ethanol during prenatal development. Prior work from our laboratory has linked deficits in social behavior following moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in the rat to functional alterations in the ventrolateral frontal cortex [21]. In addition to social behaviors, the regions comprising the ventrolateral frontal cortex are critical for diverse processes ranging from orofacial motor movements to flexible alteration of behavior in the face of changing consequences. The broader behavioral implications of altered ventrolateral frontal cortex function following moderate PAE have, however, not been examined. In the present study we evaluated the consequences of moderate PAE on social behavior, tongue protrusion, and flexibility in a variant of the Morris water task that required modification of a well-established spatial response. PAE rats displayed deficits in tongue protrusion, reduced flexibility in the spatial domain, increased wrestling, and decreased investigation, indicating that several behaviors associated with ventrolateral frontal cortex function are impaired following moderate PAE. A linear discriminant analysis revealed that measures of wrestling and tongue protrusion provided the best discrimination of PAE rats from saccharin-exposed control rats. We also evaluated all behaviors in young adult (4-5 months) or older (10-11 months) rats to address the persistence of behavioral deficits in adulthood and possible interactions between early ethanol exposure and advancing age. Behavioral deficits in each domain persisted well into adulthood (10-11 months), however, there was no evidence that aging enhances the effects of moderate PAE within the age ranges that were studied. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy causes birth defects and lifelong disabilities in the affected children. Due to the wide range of symptoms related to prenatal alcohol exposition, the umbrella term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is used. FASD covers full Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (pFAS). Children with FAS are smaller in length and weight than healthy children of their age. Head circumference is smaller as well. Typical signs of FAS are facial characteristics such small eyes, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip. Many affected children only show distinct behavioural problems (pFAS). Children with FAS or pFAS do not recognize dangerous situations, they would go with anyone, and are easily influenced. They are forgetful, do not learn from consequences. The diagnosis of FAS goes by small size and weight of the children, and the typical facial alterations. pFAS, however, is diagnosed if behavioural, social and emotional problems are present, and prenatal alcohol exposition is assured by anamnesis. Medical treatment is supplemented by occupational and behavioural therapy. The affected children need instruction, orientation, apportionment concerning time (and space), and a firm daily routine. At legal age, most patients with FASD are not able to live autonomously. They are naive and easily talked into things, therefore they require long-lasting care. Prevention and patient education, rather than being scaring, are supposed to invite and motivate pregnant women and their relatives to act responsible-minded.

N2  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) are products of the nonoxidative ethanol metabolism, which are known to be detectable in meconium after heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. The purpose of this study was to develop an analytical method that would support an efficient universal screening program. We measured ethyl palmitate (E16:0), ethyl stearate (E18:0), ethyl oleate (E18:1), ethyl laurate (E12), ethyl myristate (E14) and ethyl linoleate (E18:2). Meconium FAEE were extracted by liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction and analyzed by GC/MS using ethyl heptadecanoate as internal standard. FAEE were extracted from meconium by hexane: acetone and separated via centrifugation, after which the hexane layer was removed and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in hexane and loaded onto a silica-aminopropyl column, eluted from the columns with hexane and evaporated. The dried extract was reconstituted with 50 muL hexane and 1 muL was injected into GCMS. The ion source and interface temperatures were 250 oC and 280 oC respectively. Limit of detection (LOD) for six FAEEs ranged from 6.32 to 12.06 ng/g and the limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 19.14 to 36.18 ng/g. Meconium with FAEE levels between the LOD and LOQ were classified as containing trace levels. 72 meconium samples obtained from two hospitals in Warsaw were analyzed. In three cases FAEE were detected and quantified. The concentration range of FAEEs was 31.0 to 313.09 ng/g. Trace levels were detected in five samples. This method allows determination of FAEE in meconium and could be used in a universal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background. The role that micronutrients play in ameliorating the negative impact of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) was explored in a randomized clinical trial conducted in Rivne, Ukraine. To assess neurodevelopmental outcome, cardiac orienting responses (ORs) during an information processing paradigm were obtained from infants between 6-12 months. Methods. Women who differed in prenatal alcohol use were recruited during pregnancy and randomized to group: None, Multivitamin/Minerals (M/M), and Multivitamin/Minerals plus Choline (M/M + Choline). The habituation stimuli were presented for 10 trials and the dishabituation stimulus were presented for 5 trials. Baseline HR was collected for 30 sec prior to stimulus onset and then 9 sec post-stimulus onset from which difference values were computed for analysis for the first 3 trials of each condition. Results. A repeated measures analysis of covariance was used for each of the two time periods. On the auditory dishabituation trials, a trial by vitamin group effect was found (F (4, 172) = 2.428, p < .050, eta-squared = .053) with those in the choline +MVM group having more HR deceleration on trial 3. On the visual dishabituation trials, a significant trial by prenatal alcohol exposure history was found (F (2,180) = 3.281, p < .040, partial eta-squared = .035). Infants with a history of PAE had higher HR on trials 2 and 3 than did those without PAE. Conclusion. Prenatal alcohol negatively impacts the speed of encoding and memory of environmental events but choline supplementation during pregnancy may provide some beneficial impact to these skills.

N2  - Background. Suboptimal nutrition may explain the higher incidence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in disadvantaged populations. A clinical trial evaluated potential benefits of micronutrient supplementation, including choline, in an at risk populationin Khmelnitsky and Rivne, Omni-Net sites inWestern Ukraine. Methods. Alcohol-using and nondrinking women recruited mid-pregnancy were randomized to: 1) multivitamin/multimineral supplement (MVM); 2) MVM+ choline; 2) non-supplements. At 6-Months, children (N= 192) were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd ED) yielding standard scores for Mental Development Index (MDI), Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), orientation, emotional reactivity, and motor performance. Results. Generalized Linear Modeling evaluated the impact of amount of alcohol used preconceptionally and within pregnancy. We collapsed the two supplement groups (Suppl group) and controlled social class (SES), smoking, gender, vitamin and folic acid use prior to recruitment. MDI was significantly impacted by alcohol dose during pregnancy (beta = -14.66, X2 (1) =9.3, p < .002) with those exposed to more alcohol having lower cognitive scores. Those who received supplements performed better (beta = -3.69, X2(1) =8.03, p < .005). PDI scores did not differ by nutrition but showed a significant effect of alcohol dose during pregnancy (beta = -26.99, X2 (1) =8.28, p < .004). Orientation behavior also differed as a function of Suppl Group (beta = -5.45, X2 (1) =4.51, p < .03) and as a result of alcohol dose at conception (beta = -4.52,X 2 (1) =5.75, p < .02); Motor Optimality was affected by alcohol dose at conception and during pregnancy. Conclusions. Results suggest that multimicronutrient supplementation reduces negative impact of alcohol use during pregnancy on specific outcomes.

N2  - Background. The role of maternal nutrition among women who consume alcohol during pregnancy is largely unexplored. Methods. As part of a cohort study on FASD being conducted in Ukraine, women were recruited during pregnancy into an alcohol exposed group or an unexposed group. Blood samples were analyzed for concentrations of a wide range of micronutrients. In addition, women were randomized within group to receive a prenatal vitamin/mineral supplement or standard of care (advice to take vitamins). Infants were evaluated for physical features of FASD and performance on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 12 months. Results. Between 2007-2012, 252 alcohol-exposed and 274 unexposed women were enrolled. After adjustment for covariates, alcohol dose was associated with significantly lower concentrations of Cu, folate and vitamin D; alcohol dose was associated with significantly higher levels of homocysteine (p's <0.05). Among 298 children who completed the Bayley, those in the alcohol-exposed group scored ~10 points lower on the Mental (MDI) and Motor (PDI) Development Indices than unexposed infants (p's <0.001). There was a significant interaction between alcohol group and the vitamin intervention; those in the alcohol exposed/intervention group scored approximately 11 points higher on the MDI (p < 0.001) and 6 points higher on the PDI (p <0.04) than those assigned to standard of care. Conclusion. These data suggest that maternal nutritional status is associated with alcohol dose in pregnancy and that a vitamin supplement intervention in pregnancy may have a beneficial effect.

N2  - Background. The cardinal features of full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have been well-described. However, prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broader spectrum of structural defects with implications regarding the mechanisms of alcohol's effects on the developing fetus. Methods. We examined 831 children from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) using a structured protocol for diagnosis of FASD. Each child was evaluated for the cardinal facial and growth features, as well as for additional structural defects thought to occur more often in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects were classified as FAS, Deferred or No FAS. Groups were compared on prevalence of additional features observed, and were stratified by diagnostic category for sex, race and age. Results. Of the eight additional features evaluated, there was a statistically significant increase in seven. Children in the FAS group had the highest prevalence of additional features and those in the No FAS group had the lowest. Four of the additional features, including decreased elbow pronation/supination, decreased finger extension, hockey stick palmar crease, and other palmar crease abnormalities, could be related to decreased fetal movement, the result of the effect of alcohol on early brain development. The frequency of additional structural features varied by age and race of the child. Conclusions. This study shows that prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broad spectrum of structural defects, which is critical in documenting the true prevalence of this disorder.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt development, leading to life-long cognitive deficits. We have reported that the essential nutrient choline can protect against alcohol-induced behavioral deficits, even when administered after developmental alcohol exposure. Specifically, postnatal choline administration improves performance on memory tasks that depend on the functional integrity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Choline likely improves cognitive performance by acting as a methyl donor, a precursor to cell membranes, and/or as a precursor to acetylcholine. Using a rat model, we examined the effects of developmental alcohol exposure and postnatal choline supplementation on cholinergic receptors. Sprague-Dawley rats received ethanol (5.25 g/kg/ day) or sham intubations from postnatal days (PD) 4-9, and were treated with choline (100 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or saline from PD 10-30. On PD 38, quantitative autoradiography was used to measure nicotinic cholinergic receptor densities. Alcohol significantly reduced alpha7 receptor densities in the PFC, the amygdala, and hippocampus. Choline attenuated some of these effects, although receptor densities were still lower than those of controls. In contrast, alcohol significantly increased non-alpha7 receptor densities in various forebrain structures, and choline selectively reduced receptor densities to control levels, but only in the PFC. Choline had no significant effect on nicotinic receptor densities among the controls. Alcohol-induced alterations in cholinergic functioning likely contribute to the cognitive impairments caused by developmental alcohol exposure. These results suggest that choline supplementation may serve as an effective treatment for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, in part, by altering ethanol's action on cholinergic development and functioning.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can induce important anomalies in the developing brain, being embryogenesis an important critical period for the craniofacial defects and mental disabilities associated with foetal alcohol syndrome. We generate neural progenitors (NPs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to reproduce early stages of human brain development and we evaluate the effects of ethanol during early embryogenesis. We show that neuroepithelial progenitors display the morphological and functional characteristics of their embryonic counterparts, and the proper timing of neurons and glia cells generation, reproducing the early stages of human brain development. Immunocytochemical and RT-PCR analyses reveal that cells appeared as clusters during neuroepithelial cell proliferation, and that the genes associated with the neuroectodermal (Pax-6) and the endodermic (alpha-fetoprotein, AFP) lineages decreased in parallel to the up-regulation of the genes of neural progenitors (nestin, Tuj1), followed by their differentiation into neurons (MAP-2 + , GABA+), oligodendrocytes (GalC+) and astrocytes (GFAP+). Ethanol exposure (25 mM) impairs the derivation of hESCs towards NPs, altering the disappearance of the neuroectodermal and endodermic markers PAX-6 and AFP, as well as the Nanog and Sox2 expression, suggesting that ethanol alters cell fate and maintains the NPs in undifferented state. Ethanol also impairs the differentiation of NPs into mature neurons and astrocytes (e.g. MAP-2, GFAP, GABA). These results provide evidence that exposure to alcohol during early embryogenesis, alters cell fate and disrupts the transformation of NPs into mature neural cells. These effects could contribute to the mechanisms that lead to the abnormal craniofacial defects associated with FASD.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to impairment in cerebellar structure and function, including eyeblink conditioning. The deep cerebellar nuclei, which play a critical role in cerebellar-mediated learning, receive extensive inputs from brain stem and cerebellar cortex and provide the point of origin for most of the output fibers to other regions of the brain. We used in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurochemistry in this important cerebellar region. Methods: MRS data from the deep cerebellar nuclei were acquired from 37 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 17 non- or minimally exposed controls from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa. Results: Increased maternal alcohol consumption around time of conception was associated with lower N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the deep nuclei (r = -0.33, p < 0.05). Higher levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to lower levels of the choline-containing metabolites (r = -0.37, p < 0.01), glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine (Cho). Alcohol consumption levels both at conception (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and during pregnancy (r = 0.38, p < 0.01) were related to higher levels of glutamate plus glutamine (Glx). All these effects continued to be significant after controlling for potential confounders. Conclusions: The lower NAA levels seen in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure may reflect impaired neuronal integrity in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Our finding of lower Cho points to disrupted Cho metabolism of membrane phospholipids, reflecting altered neuropil development with potentially reduced content of dendrites and synapses. The alcohol-related alterations in Glx may suggest a disruption of the glutamate-glutamine cycling involved in glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Invited commentary on Australian fetal alcohol spectrum disorder diagnostic guidelines
A1  - Astley S.J.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The publication of Australian fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) diagnostic guidelines marks an important step forward in Australia's efforts to prevent FASD. But do we need yet another set of FASD guidelines? At the 5th International FASD Conference, the ever growing number of FASD diagnostic guidelines was identified as a core area of concern by leaders in FASD worldwide. All agreed we need to strive to adopt a single set of guidelines. It is essential that FASD diagnosis advance to incorporate new knowledge and technology. But to date, the field of FASD has seen multiple sets of guidelines published that do not address the important question-How is the performance of these new guidelines superior to the performance of existing guidelines to warrant/justify their introduction into the medical literature?The Australian guidelines include FAS, PFAS and Neurodevelopmental Disorder-Alcohol Exposed (ND-AE). This latter group includes individuals with severe CNS abnormalities without the physical features of FAS. This is the group the 4-Digit-Code calls Static-Encephalopathy-Alcohol-Exposed (SE-AE). The criteria for FAS, PFAS, and ND-AE (or what the 4-Digit-Code calls SE-AE) are identical between the Australian and 4-Digit-Code guidelines with the exception of one very small, but very consequential difference in facial criteria for PFAS. The 4-Digit-Code requires a Rank 3 FAS facial phenotype for PFAS (J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol 20(3):e416-e467, 2013); the Australian guidelines relax the criteria to include the Rank 2 FAS facial phenotype. This relaxation of the criteria renders the facial phenotype NOT specific to prenatal alcohol exposure as confirmed in published empirical studies. If the facial phenotype is not specific to (caused only by) prenatal alcohol exposure one can no longer validly call the outcome PFAS. When one makes a diagnosis of FAS (full or partial), one is stating explicitly that the individual has a syndrome caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. One is also stating explicitly that the biological mother drank alcohol during pregnancy and, as a result, harmed her child. These are bold conclusions to draw and are not without medical, ethical, and even legal consequences. So the question remains-Why go against the published empirical evidence and relax the PFAS facial criteria into the normal range? © 2014 Astley; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: Maternal self-reports, used for the detection of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), may lack validity, necessitating the use of an objective biomarker. The detection of fatty acid ethyl esters (products of non-oxidative ethanol metabolism) in meconium has been established as a novel biomarker of PAE. The purpose of the current study was to compare the prevalence of PAE as reported via maternal self-reports with the results of meconium testing, and to quantify the disparity between these two methods. Methods: A systematic literature search for studies reporting on the prevalence of PAE, using maternal self-reports in combination with meconium testing, was conducted using multiple electronic bibliographic databases. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated based on eight studies, using the Mantel-Haenszel method, assuming a random effects model. A random effects meta-regression was performed to test for a difference. Results: The pooled prevalence of PAE as measured by meconium testing was 4.26 (95% CI: 1.34-13.57) times the pooled prevalence of PAE as measured by maternal self-reports. Large variations across the studies in regard to the difference between estimates obtained from maternal self-reports and those obtained from meconium testing were observed. Conclusions: If maternal self-reports are the sole information source upon which health care professionals rely, a number of infants who were prenatally exposed to alcohol are not being recognized as such. However, further research is needed in order to validate existing biomarkers, as well as discover new biomarkers, for the detection of PAE. © 2014 Lange et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) consists of a pattern of mental and physical defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. The disorder is well described during childhood while little is known about adults. This ongoing study investigates Swedish adults with FAS regarding their socieconomic situation by variables such as state of employment, early retirement from work, dependence on public welfare, criminality, marital and parental state, mortality rate, and medical care. Adults with FAS (N=80, age 19 to 49 years, mean age 30 years, 63% men) and a comparison group matched to gender and age (N=2664) are included. Data are obtained from the Swedish Governmental Office of Statistics, National Board of Health and Welfare, Enforcement Authorities, and the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. Up to now data show that 54% of the adults with FAS and 26% of the comparison group (p<0.05) were unemployed. Thirty-three percent of the study group versus 3% of the comparison group (p<0.001) had retired early from work. Twenty-six percent of the individuals with FAS and six percent of the comparison group (p<0.001) were dependent on public welfare. Eighty percent of the study group and 50% of the comparison group (p<0.01) were living as singles (i.e., without their children), if any, and/or a partner. The results indicate that the adults with FAS had a difficult socioeconomic situation compared with their gender and age-matched persons. Such knowledge might be useful in understanding and providing support to this vulnerable and socially-exposed population.

N2  - Multiple cardiovascular malformations were caused by alcohol during pregnancy. Unfortunately, the potential mechanism of cardiac dysplasia induced by alcohol remains enigmatic. Some studies demonstrated that histone acetylases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) were involved in cardiogenesis. However, the role of HATs and HDACs in cardiac dysplasia induced by alcohol is still unknown. Therefore, the study of HATs and HDACs could provide an outstanding opportunity to investigate how epigenetic mechanism regulate cardiac-specific genes during cardiogenesis. To explore the epigenetic mechanism of alcohol induced congenital heart disease (CHD) during pregnancy, pregnant mice were exposed to alcohol by gavage. We found that global HATs activity were abnormally elevated and HATs coimmunoprecipitated with histone on promoter of cardiac-specific gene Gata4 in cardiac tissues. However, global HDACs activity were unaltered. The binding of P300, CBP, PCAF, SRC1 was disordered on promoter region of Gata4 in alcohol exposed mice at different stages, except for GCN5. This observation was abnormal elevated by acetylation of H3AcK9 on promoter of Gata4 in alcohol exposed mice. Noteworthily, the mRNA expression of Gata4 was abnormal increased in alcohol exposed mice. In vivo treatment of alcohol exposed pregnant mice with the pan-histone acetylase inhibitor anacardic acid significantly decreased the binding of P300, PCAF on promoter of Gata4 and partly reduced H3AcK9 hyperacetylation induced by alcohol. Interestingly, Anacardic acid partly reduced mRNA over-expression of Gata4 caused by alcohol. These results suggested that covalent modification imbalance of histone acetylation may be a dominating mechanism of CHD induced by alcohol during pregnancy. Epigenetics might provide novel entry points for therapeutic control of CHD.

N2  - Curcumin is a major phenolic compound from turmeric and well-known dietary spices, possesses various pharmacological effects, and one of the major histone acetyl-transferases (HATs) inhibitors. The hypothesis for this study is curcumin will has protective effects in cardiac abnormalities of fetal mice induced by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Fifty pregnant C57BL/6 mice were separated into five groups (n = 10), untreated group (Blank), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) group, alcohol group, curcumin group, alcohol plus curcumin group. Each of the fetal mice heart was collected on embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5). The changes of HATs activities, level of acetylated histone H3(Ac-H3), cardiac specific genes expression of GATA4, Mef2c, Nkx2.5, DHAND and EHAND (GMNDE), and structure of chromatin were determined by colorimetric, Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays respectively. Treated with curcumin significantly reduced the activities of HATs and the levels of acetylated histone H3, down regulated the expression of GMNDE, the curcumin group has significant difference between the other groups(p < 0.01). Moreover, curcumin reversed the heart abnormal development induced by PAE, the curcumin plus alcohol group has no significant difference between blank group and DMSO group (p > 0.05). Results from the ChIP assay showed that GMNDE physically interacted with Ac-H3, Ac-H3 is reduced significantly after treated with curcumin (p < 0.05 vs. curcumin plus alcohol; p < 0.01 vs. blank group; p < 0.01 vs. alcohol group). These results suggested that curcumin could be an effective agent for preventing the heart abnormal development induced by PAE, and its mechanism may be reduces the level of Ac-H3 against the heart abnormal development.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) increases the risk for The Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Many SIDS infants are exposed to repeated hypoxia before death. Arousal in response to hypoxia is impaired after PAE and is modulated by medullary raphe GABAergic mechanisms. We therefore hypothesized that arousal impairment after PAE would be associated with increases in medullary GABA. Pregnant dams received an ethanol liquid diet (ETOH), an iso-caloric pair fed diet (PF) or a standard chow diet (CHOW). Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) or nipecotic acid (NIP), a GABA reuptake inhibitor, was microinjected (50 nL) into the raphe magnus (RMg) of P15 and P21 pups from each diet group. After recovery, pups were exposed to 4 episodes of hypoxia and the time to arousal (latency) was determined behaviorally. Brainstem GABA concentration was measured (HPLC) in P5, P15 and P21 pups from each diet group. At P21, ACSF injected pups in the ETOH group had longer arousal latencies than those in the PF and CHOW pups combined (CON group) (P<0.001). ETOH pups also had higher brainstem GABA concentrations (P=0.013). Moreover, CON pups injected with NIP had arousal latencies similar to those in ETOH pups after ACSF injection and NIP injected ETOH pups had no further increases in arousal latency. Our results show that the effects of PAE on arousal are associated increases in brainstem GABA and that RMg GABA reuptake mechanisms may be involved.

N2  - Background: Many women drink during pregnancy and lactation despite recommendations to abstain. In animals, alcohol exposure during pregnancy and lactation influences lung and immune development, plausibly increasing risk of asthma and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Studies in humans are few. Methods: In the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, we examined maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy and lactation in relation to risk of current asthma at 36 months (49,138 children), recurrent LRTIs by 36 months (39,791 children), and current asthma at 7 years (13,253 children). Mothers reported frequency and amount of alcohol intake each trimester and the first 3 months following delivery. We calculated adjusted relative risk (aRR), comparing children of drinkers to nondrinkers, using Generalized Linear Models. Results: A total of 31.8% of mothers consumed alcohol during first trimester, 9.7% during second trimester, and 15.6% during third trimester. Infrequent and low-dose prenatal alcohol exposure showed a modest statistically significant inverse association with current asthma at 36 months (aRRs ~ 0.85). No association was seen with the highest alcohol intakes during the first trimester when alcohol consumption was most common. RRs of maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy with recurrent LRTIs were ~1, with sporadic differences in risk for some metrics of intake, but without any consistent pattern. For current asthma at 7 years, similar inverse associations were seen as with current asthma at 36 months but were not statistically significant. Among children breastfed throughout the first 3 months of life, maternal alcohol intake during this time was not significantly associated with any of the 3 outcomes. Conclusions: The low levels of alcohol exposure during pregnancy or lactation observed in this cohort were not associated with increased risk of asthma or recurrent LRTIs. The slight inverse associations of infrequent or low-dose prenatal alcohol exposure with asthma may not be causal. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are thought to be a leading cause of developmental disabilities worldwide. However, data are lacking on alcohol use among pregnant women in many countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of alcohol consumption by pregnant women in Ukraine. Methods: Cross-sectional screening of pregnant women was conducted in 2 regions of Ukraine during the recruitment phase of an ongoing clinical study that is part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. Women attending a routine prenatal visit at 1 of 2 participating regional centers were asked about alcohol consumption. Quantity and frequency of alcoholic beverages consumed in the month around conception and in the most recent month of pregnancy were measured using a standard interview instrument. Results: Between 2007 and 2012, 11,909 pregnant women were screened on average in the second trimester of pregnancy. Of these, 92.7% reported being ever-drinkers. Among ever-drinkers, 54.8% reported drinking alcohol in the month around conception and 12.9% consumed at least 3 drinks on at least 1 day in that time period. In the most recent month of pregnancy, 46.3% continued to report alcohol use and 9.2% consumed at least 3 drinks per day. Significant predictors of average number of drinks or heavier drinking per day in either time period in pregnancy included lower gravidity, being single, unmarried/living with a partner, or separated, lower maternal education, smoking, younger age at initiation of drinking, and higher score on the TWEAK screening test for harmful drinking. Conclusions: These findings support the need for education/intervention in women of childbearing age in Ukraine and can help inform targeted interventions for women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The initiation of a standard screening protocol in pregnancy is a step in the right direction. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Adipose tissue secretes numerous bioactive peptides ("adipocytokines"). Visceral fat mediates inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, subcutaneous fat is the principal source of adiponectin production. Adiponectin, consisting of 247 amino acids and single nucleotide polymorphisms (mutations), causes hypoadiponectinemia. Individuals with this mutation are highly susceptible for development of insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, hypertention, and left ventricular hypertrophy. We hypothesize that alcohol consumption during pregnancy may alter endocrine signaling, by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines thus inducing fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Even low-dose/or short duration ethanol exposure early in development can produce more subtle effects by alteration of subcutaneous fat and subsequently, decrease in adiponectin production. Zebrafish eggs (AB strain) were raised in water (control) or in 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, and 2.5% ethanol solution for one of 3dpf, 5 dpf, 10 dpf, 15dpf, or 20dpf. Anatomical measures including heart diameter and total body length were compared across groups. At the concentration of 2.5%, there were more abnormal physical distortions and significantly higher mortality rates than any other group. Nile Red (NR) and Oil Red O (ORO) staining was used to detect adipogenesis (visceral vs subcutaneous) fat depots. Adipogenesis during zebrafish development was altered and subcutaneous fat was depleted at 15pft after 2% alcohol exposure compared with control. The expression of an "adipogenic" transcriptional program including PPAR, SREBP1c, CEBPalpha and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, HIF-1alpha ROS, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB was altered, as evident from quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We conclude that exposure of zebrafish larvae to ethanol during development results in modified external and internal morphological development and that the severity of these effects is due to remarkable changes in adiposity and hypoadiponectinemia.

N2  - Background:South Africa has one of the world's highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and interpersonal trauma. These co-occurring public health problems raise the need to understand alcohol consumption among trauma-exposed pregnant women in this setting. Since a known predictor of drinking during pregnancy is drinking behavior before pregnancy, this study explored the relationship between women's drinking levels before and after pregnancy recognition, and whether traumatic experiences - childhood abuse or recent intimate partner violence (IPV) - moderated this relationship.Methods:Women with incident pregnancies (N = 66) were identified from a longitudinal cohort of 560 female drinkers in a township of Cape Town, South Africa. Participants were included if they reported no pregnancy at one assessment and then reported pregnancy four months later at the next assessment. Alcohol use was measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and traumatic experiences of childhood abuse and recent IPV were also assessed. Hierarchical linear regressions controlling for race and age examined childhood abuse and recent IPV as moderators of the effect of pre-pregnancy recognition drinking on post-pregnancy recognition AUDIT scores.Results:Following pregnancy recognition, 73% of women reported drinking at hazardous levels (AUDIT > 8). Sixty-four percent reported early and/or recent exposure to trauma. While drinking levels before pregnancy significantly predicted drinking levels after pregnancy recognition, t(64) = 3.50, p <.01, this relationship was moderated by experiences of childhood abuse, B =577, t(60) = -2.58, p =.01, and recent IPV, B =477, t(60) = -2.16, p =.04. Pregnant women without traumatic experiences reported drinking at levels consistent with levels before pregnancy recognition. However, women with traumatic experiences tended to report elevated AUDIT scores following pregnancy recognition, even if low-risk drinkers previously.Conclusion:This study explored how female drinkers in South Africa may differentially modulate their drinking patterns upon pregnancy recognition, depending on trauma history. Our results suggest that women with traumatic experiences are more likely to exhibit risky alcohol consumption when they become pregnant, regardless of prior risk. These findings illuminate the relevance of trauma-informed efforts to reduce FASD in South Africa. © 2014 Choi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is an umbrella term that refers to a wide range of behavioral and cognitive deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. It involves changes in brain gene expression that underlie lifelong FASD symptoms. How these changes are achieved from immediate to long-term effects, and how they are maintained, is unknown. We have used the C57BL/6J mouse to assess the dynamics of genomic alterations following binge alcohol exposure. Ethanol-exposed fetal (short-term effect) and adult (long-term effect) brains were assessed for gene expression and microRNA (miRNA) changes using Affymetrix mouse arrays. We identified 48 and 68 differentially expressed genes in short- and long-term groups, respectively. No gene was common between the 2 groups. Short-term (immediate) genes were involved in cellular compromise and apoptosis, which represent ethanol's toxic effects. Long-term genes were involved in various cellular functions, including epigenetics. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed the downregulation of long-term genes: Camk1g, Ccdc6, Egr3, Hspa5, and Xbp1. miRNA arrays identified 20 differentially expressed miRNAs, one of which (miR-302c) was confirmed. miR-302c was involved in an inverse relationship with Ccdc6. A network-based model involving altered genes illustrates the importance of cellular redox, stress and inflammation in FASD. Our results also support a critical role of apoptosis in FASD, and the potential involvement of miRNAs in the adaptation of gene expression following prenatal ethanol exposure. The ultimate molecular footprint involves inflammatory disease, neurological disease and skeletal and muscular disorders as major alterations in FASD. At the cellular level, these processes represent abnormalities in redox, stress and inflammation, with potential underpinnings to anxiety. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study is in collaboration with MaternalInfant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC), a look into the Canadian profile of in utero exposures through meconium analysis. The focus of this study was to investigate the incidence of heavy alcohol use during pregnancy in Canada through meconium analysis. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) serve as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. This study is the first to investigate alcohol use during pregnancy in Canada through meconium FAEE analysis. METHODS: Meconium was collected from 1,537 newborns at 11 obstetric units across Canada and participating mothers also completed questionnaires that contained a section focusing on alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. The questionnaires will serve as a maternal self-report and will be compared to meconium FAEE concentration. Any meconium sample with a total FAEE concentration (the sum of ethyl palmitate, oleate, stearate and linoleate concentrations) greater than 2 nmol/g meconium is classified as positive for excessive alcohol consumption during the second and/or third trimesters of pregnancy. RESULTS: Thus far, 82 samples have been processed, with 62 eligible for analysis. Of the samples analyzed, 10 were deemed transitional and results inconclusive and 2 were identified as positive. This equates to a 3.22% positivity rate for heavy fetal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSION: Through this study, heavy alcohol use rates in a pregnant population in Canada will be determined. Meconium FAEE analysis via GC-MS is currently ongoing at the Motherisk Laboratory.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is a leading cause of significant neurobehavioral and neurocognitive deficits. Its potential consequences for eating behaviors, nutritional status, and other nutritional issues in childhood have received little attention. Methods: Nineteen children (11 boys, 8 girls) of mean age 9.6 years, referred for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) screening and assessment, were analyzed with physical exams and caregiver questionnaires to identify possible abnormalities in food and eating behaviors. Fourteen children contributed 24-hour diet recalls and were assessed for nutritional status. Results: Seventy-nine percent of participants were diagnosed with FASD and 63.2% had confirmed PAE. Fifty percent of girls were overweight or obese, whereas 37% of boys had reduced stature, weight, or body mass index for their age. Recurring feeding problems included constant snacking (36.8%), lack of satiety (26.3%), and picky eating/poor appetite (31.6%). None had oral feeding problems. Constipation was common (26.3%). Macronutrient intakes were largely normal, but sugar consumption was excessive (140 to 190% of recommendations) in 57% of subjects. Vitamin A intake exceeded the upper limit for 64% of participants, whereas >50% had intakes <80% of recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for choline, vitamin E, potassium, beta-carotene, and essential fatty acids; 100% had vitamin D intakes <80% of the RDA. Conclusions: PAE may be associated with altered acquisition and distribution of body mass with increasing age. Disordered eating was common. The increased feeding behaviors surrounding lack of satiety suggest that self-regulation may be altered. Constipation could reflect low dietary fiber or altered gastrointestinal function. These exploratory data suggest that children with PAE may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies, which are influenced by inappropriate food preferences, disordered eating patterns, medication use, and the stressful dynamics surrounding food preparation and mealtime. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Adolescent binge alcohol exposure has long-lasting effects on the expression of hypothalamic genes that regulate the stress response, even in the absence of subsequent adult alcohol exposure. This suggests that alcohol can induce permanent gene expression changes, potentially through epigenetic modifications to specific genes. Epigenetic modifications can be transmitted to future generations therefore, and in these studies we investigated the effects of adolescent binge alcohol exposure on hypothalamic gene expression patterns in the F1 generation offspring. It has been well documented that maternal alcohol exposure during fetal development can have devastating neurological consequences. However, less is known about the consequences of maternal and/or paternal alcohol exposure outside of the gestational time frame. Here, we exposed adolescent male and female rats to a repeated binge EtOH exposure paradigm and then mated them in adulthood. Hypothalamic samples were taken from the offspring of these animals at postnatal day (PND) 7 and subjected to a genome-wide microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR for selected genes. Importantly, the parents were not intoxicated at the time of mating and were not exposed to EtOH at any time during gestation therefore the offspring were never directly exposed to EtOH. Our results showed that the offspring of alcohol-exposed parents had significant differences compared to offspring from alcohol-naive parents. Specifically, major differences were observed in the expression of genes that mediate neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity during neurodevelopment, genes important for directing chromatin remodeling, posttranslational modifications or transcription regulation, as well as genes involved in regulation of obesity and reproductive function. These data demonstrate that repeated binge alcohol exposure during pubertal development can potentially have detrimental effects on future offspring even in the absence of direct fetal alcohol exposure. © 2014 Przybycien-Szymanska et al.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Detection of at-risk alcohol consumption during pregnancy is essential for prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs), with the widely used T-ACE screen developed for that purpose. Recent work with an urban cohort revealed that increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point from 2 to 3 doubled specificity of detecting risk drinking in pregnancy without reducing sensitivity substantially. The goal of this study was to further validate a cut-point of 3 (TACER-3) in a rural cohort. METHODS: Prospectively recruited pregnant patients (n=540) completed the T-ACE and a simple alcohol questionnaire that assessed the women's self-reported typical pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption. RESULTS: 22.2% of participants were positive on the T-ACE (cutpoint =2) compared to 5.4% positive on the TACER-3 (cut-point =3). An ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD contrasts revealed that "At- Risk" women (positive on T-ACE and TACER-3) reported consuming significantly more alcohol per day before pregnancy than both the "Notat- Risk" (negative on both on T-ACE and TACER-3) and "Change Risk" (positive on T-ACE but not TACER-3) women (omnibus F=22.3, p<.001). The rate of average daily alcohol use among women in the "Change Risk" group was not significantly different than women in the "No Risk" group. Relative Risk scores indicated that women in the TACER-3-positive "At- Risk" group were 6.6 times more likely to drink alcohol at risk levels (>0.5 absolute oz./day) than women in the "No-Risk" group, and 2.6 times more likely than women in the "Change Risk" group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the original T-ACE, the TACER-3 was more effective at selectively identifying women who were drinking at risk level prior to pregnancy recognition in this rural cohort. These analyses further validate prior findings that using the TACER-3 reduces "false positives." The TACER-3 allows for more efficient use of health care provider time in directing targeted clinical interventions with those pregnant women most at risk for adverse fetal outcomes.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, a continuum of physiological, behavioural, and cognitive phenotypes that include increased risk for anxiety and learning-associated disorders. Prenatal alcohol exposure results in life-long disorders that may manifest in part through the induction of long-term gene expression changes, potentially maintained through epigenetic mechanisms. Findings: Here we report a decrease in the expression of Canabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1) and an increase in the expression of the regulatory microRNA miR-26b in the brains of adult mice exposed to ethanol during neurodevelopment. Furthermore, we show that miR-26b has significant complementarity to the 3'-UTR of the Cnr1 transcript, giving it the potential to bind and reduce the level of Cnr1 expression. Conclusions: These findings elucidate a mechanism through which some genes show long-term altered expression following prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to persistent alterations to cognitive function and behavioural phenotypes observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2013 Stringer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in the world. However, little is known about what men and women who attend alcohol serving establishments believe about alcohol use during pregnancy and how these beliefs may be related to alcohol use. Objectives: To understand FASD beliefs and related behaviors among men and women attending alcohol-serving establishments. Methods: We surveyed 1047 men (n=565) and women (n=482) -including pregnant women and men with pregnant partners- attending alcohol serving establishments in a township located in Cape Town, South Africa. Results: Among both pregnant (n=53) and non-pregnant (n=429) women, 54% reported drinking alcohol at least 2-4 times per month, and 57% reported having at least 3-4 alcohol drinks during a typical drinking session. Pregnant women were less likely to believe that they should not drink alcohol and that alcohol can harm a fetus when compared to non-pregnant women. Similar findings were observed between men with pregnant partners compared to men without pregnant partners. Among women, beliefs about how much alcohol pregnant women can safely drink were associated with self-reported alcohol use. Conclusions: Efforts to address FASD need to focus on understanding how men and women perceive alcohol use during pregnancy and situational factors that contribute to alcohol consumption among pregnant women attending alcohol serving establishments. Structural and individual-level interventions targeting women at alcohol serving establishments should be prioritized to mitigate alcohol use during pregnancy. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: Alcohol is a potent teratogen inducing oxidative stress as well as a massive wave of apoptosis in the developing brain as well as oxidative stress. It affects brain including cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex resulting into motor and cognitive deficits. Alcohol depletes folic acid from the body which is essential for synthesis of DNA, RNA and protein during cell division and proved to prevent many brain related malformations. Purpose: The objective of the present study was to study whether folic acid reduces behavioral impairments that were induced by prenatal exposure to ethanol in mice. Methods: Pregnant mice were divided into different experimental groups. Group I termed as control receiving distilled water, group II received ethanol, group III ethanol and folic acid and group IV folic acid only from gestational days 6 to 15. The dams were allowed to deliver their offspring naturally and until weaning the pups remained with their natural mothers. At the age of 8-9 weeks, they were subjected to battery of various behavioral tests. Results: The alcohol exposed dams showed decreased motor activity in open field test and decreased exploration and increased anxiety in elevated maze test as compared to controls. Folic acid administration reduced the intensity of these effects of alcohol in mice. Conclusion: The exposure to alcohol in utero produces long lasting effect on the developing pharmacological character of brain affecting postnatal behavioral expression which may be reduced by prenatal folic acid administration.

N2  - Clinical research and practice support a multi-method approach to validating behavioral problems in children. We examined whether parent-reported symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention (using the Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale) were substantiated by objective laboratory measures [hyperactivity measured by wrist-worn actigraphy (ACT) and inattention assessed using a 20-minute continuous performance task (CPT)] in three age- and demographically-matched groups of school-age children: children with prenatal alcohol exposure (AE), non-exposed children with idiopathic ADHD (ADHD), and controls (CON). Results indicated that the clinical groups (AE, ADHD) had significantly higher parent-reported levels for both domains compared to the CON group, and did not differ from each other. On the laboratory measures, the clinical groups were more inattentive than controls on the CPT, but did not differ from each other. In contrast, the ADHD group had higher objective activity on the ACT than AE and CON, which did not differ from each other. Thus, laboratory measures differentially validated parent reports in a group-dependent manner. Actigraphy substantiated parent-reported hyperactivity for children in the ADHD group but not for children in the AE group, while the CPT validated parent-reported inattention for both clinical groups. Although the majority of children in the AE group met the criteria for ADHD, objective activity levels were not different from controls, indicating that hyperactivity may be a less prominent feature in the AE group. Thus, while there is considerable overlap between the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD, differences in behavioral profiles may be clinically useful in differential diagnosis. Further, these data indicate that objective measures should be used to validate parent reports. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Aims: Although Russia has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable burden of disease, little is known about the existing research on prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) in this country. The objective of this study was to locate and review published and unpublished studies related to any aspect of PAE and FASD conducted in or using study populations from Russia. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple English and Russian electronic bibliographic databases. In addition, a manual search was conducted in several major libraries in Moscow. Results: The search revealed a small pool of existing research studies related to PAE and/or FASD in Russia (126: 22 in English and 104 in Russian). Existing epidemiological data indicate a high prevalence of PAE and FASD, which underlines the strong negative impact that alcohol has on mortality, morbidity and disability in Russia. High levels of alcohol consumption by women of childbearing age, low levels of contraception use, and low levels of knowledge by health and other professionals regarding the harmful effects of PAE put this country at great risk of further alcohol-affected pregnancies. Conclusions: Alcohol preventive measures in Russia warrant immediate attention. More research focused on alcohol prevention and policy is needed in order to reduce alcohol-related harm, especially in the field of FASD. © The Author 2013.

N2  - Alcohol consumption by mothers during pregnancy causes a fetal alcohol syndrome associated with massive neuronal apoptosis. We have recently shown that taurine at a dose of 2 g/kg saves about 50% of dying cerebellar neurons from ethanol-induced apoptosis in 7-day-old mice. However, a further increase in the taurine dose to ethanol-treated mice had a toxic and in some cases lethal effect. In the present work we studied the toxic effects of taurine and ethanol coadministration in three age groups: 7-day-old, adult (5 to 6 months old), and old (12 to 13 months old) mice. Taurine and ethanol were injected in two half-doses: taurine at 0 and 4 h and ethanol at 1 and 3 h. The minimal 100% lethal doses in coadministration of taurine and ethanol were the following: 7-day-old mice-6 g/kg taurine + 5 g/kg ethanol, adult mice-10 g/kg of taurine + 8 g/kg of ethanol, and old mice-above 6 g/kg of taurine + 6 g/kg of ethanol. All mice treated with taurine or ethanol alone survived. The adult and old mice dying from the combined toxicity of taurine and ethanol showed a marked fall in blood glucose, which may be one reason for lethality. A comparison of the lethal doses of taurine and ethanol coadministration in different age groups allows us to conclude that the adverse effect of the combined toxicity of taurine and ethanol is age dependent. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

T1  - Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Is Associated with Altered Subcellular Distribution of Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid Receptors in the Adolescent Mouse Hippocampal Formation

N2  - Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that several of the long-term consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are the result of changes in the development and function of cortico-limbic structures, including the hippocampal formation. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) are key regulators of hippocampal formation development, structure, and functioning and, thus, are potential mediators of PAE's effects on this brain region. In the present studies, we assessed the impact of PAE on components of corticosteroid signaling pathways in the mouse hippocampal formation. Methods: Throughout pregnancy, mouse dams were offered either 10% (w/v) ethanol sweetened with 0.066% (w/v) saccharin (SAC) or 0.066% (w/v) SAC alone using a limited (4-hour) access, drinking-in-the-dark paradigm. The hippocampal formation was isolated from naive postnatal day 40 to 50 offspring, and subcellular fractions were prepared. Using immunoblotting techniques, we measured the levels of GR, MR, 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11beta-HSD1), and the FK506-binding proteins 51 (FKBP51, FKBP5) and 52 (FKBP52, FKBP4). Finally, we determined the effect of PAE on context discrimination, a hippocampal-dependent learning/memory task. Results: PAE was associated with reduced MR and elevated GR nuclear localization in the hippocampal formation, whereas cytosolic levels of both receptors were not significantly altered. FKBP51 levels were reduced, while FKBP52 levels were unaltered, and 11beta-HSD1 levels were increased in postnuclear fractions isolated from PAE mouse hippocampal formation. These neurochemical alterations were associated with reduced context discrimination. Conclusions: The data support a model in which PAE leads to increased nuclear localization of GRs secondary to reductions in FKBP51 and increases in 11beta-HSD1 levels in the adolescent mouse hippocampal formation. Persistent dysregulation of GR subcellular distribution is predicted to damage the hippocampal formation and may underlie many of the effects of PAE on hippocampal-dependent functioning. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that emotional withdrawal is an early indicator of affective disorder in infants heavily exposed prenatally to alcohol, which is independent of alcohol-related effects on mother-infant interaction and temperament and discriminated between children later diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS) and predicted cognitive and affective outcomes at 5 and 9 years. Methods: The sample consisted of Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) infants, whose mothers were interviewed during pregnancy regarding their alcohol consumption using a timeline follow-back approach. Infant emotional withdrawal (n = 85) was assessed on the Alarm Distress Baby Scale at 6.5 months. Mother-infant interaction was evaluated from video recordings during free play and infant feeding at 6.5 months (n = 127). Infant temperament was assessed by maternal report on the EAS Temperament Survey at 13 months (n = 119). Sociodemographic and psychological correlates of maternal alcohol use and infant iron deficiency were examined as potential confounders. The children were diagnosed for FAS/PFAS by expert dysmorphologists at 5 years, cognitive and affective function at 5 and 9 years. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with increased infant emotional withdrawal and decreased activity, but unrelated to mother-infant interaction or any other temperament measures. Children later diagnosed with FAS and PFAS at 5 years exhibited more emotional withdrawal and less responsivity and activity as infants. Infant withdrawal, responsivity, quality of interaction, and maternal sensitivity also predicted poorer IQ and affective response at 5 and 9 years. When all 4 infant affective measures were examined simultaneously in a regression analysis, only infant emotional withdrawal persisted as a significant predictor of 9-year IQ. Conclusions: This study is the first to document a direct effect of fetal alcohol exposure on emotional withdrawal in infancy. These data link prenatal alcohol to a specific aspect of infant affective function not attributable to mother-infant interaction, infant temperament, or other socioemotional aspects of the infant's environment and identify infant emotional withdrawal as an early indicator of affective disturbance, particularly in children later diagnosed with FAS and PFAS. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Ethanol is known as a potent teratogen responsible for the fetal alcohol syndrome characterized by cognitive deficits especially pronounced in juveniles but ameliorating in adults. Since the mechanisms of these deficits and following partial recovery are not fully elucidated, the aim of the present study was to investigate the process of synaptogenesis in the hippocampus over the first two months of life in control and fetal-alcohol rats. Ethanol was delivered to the pregnant dams by intragastric intubation throughout 7-21 gestation days at the daily dose of 6. g/kg generating a mean blood alcohol level of 246.6 +/- 40.9 mg/dl on gestation day 20. The spine densities as well as the expression of pre- and postsynaptic proteins, synaptophysin (SYP) and PSD-95 protein, were evaluated for three distinct hippocampal regions: CA1, CA2+3, and DG and four postnatal days: PD1, PD10, PD30 and PD60, independently. Our results confirmed an intensive synaptogenesis within the brain spurt period (first 10 postnatal days), however, the temporal pattern of changes in the SYP and PSD-95 expression was different. The ethanol exposure during half of the 1st and the whole 2nd human trimester equivalent resulted in an overall trend toward lower values of synaptic indices at PD1 with a fast recovery from these deficits observed already at PD10. At PD30, around the age when the most pronounced behavioral deficits have been previously reported in juvenile fetal-alcohol subjects, no significant changes were found in either the hippocampal levels of synaptic proteins or in the spine density in principal hippocampal neurons. © 2013 ISDN.

T1  - Anthropometric and health-related behavioral factors in the explanation of social inequalities in low birth weight in children with prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Pfinder M.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - There is evidence for social inequalities in the health status of children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). This study aimed to describe social inequalities in low birth weight (LBW) in children/adolescents with PAE and to examine the contribution of anthropometric and health-related behavioral factors to the explanation of social inequalities. A total of 2,159 participants with parental self-reported moderate to regular PAE (enrolled in the cross-sectional German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents) were examined. At similar levels of PAE, the risk of LBW was significantly increased in subjects with a low socioeconomic status (SES) (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59, 4.86) and middle SES (adjusted OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.28, 3.24). Maternal height, maternal body mass index (BMI) and smoking during pregnancy mediated the association. The mediating effect of maternal height was 12.5% to 33.7%. Maternal BMI explained 7.9% of the socioeconomic difference in LBW between the high and low SES groups in children with PAE. The mediating effect of smoking during pregnancy was 17.3% to 31.5%. Maternal height, maternal BMI and smoking during pregnancy together explained 24.4% to 60.1% of the socioeconomic differences in LBW in children with PAE. A large proportion of the socioeconomic differences in LBW in children with PAE can be attributed to anthropometric and health-related behavioral factors. © 2014 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Background: Previous studies on male rodents found that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) decreases the number of serotonin immunoreactive (5-HT-ir) neurons in the brainstem. However, data on the effects of PAE in females are lacking. In light of known sex differences in responsiveness of the 5-HT system and known effects of estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) in the brain, we hypothesized that sex steroids will modulate the adverse effects of PAE on 5-HT neurons in adult females. Methods: Adult females from 3 prenatal groups (Prenatal alcohol-exposed [PAE], Pair-fed [PF], and ad libitum-fed Controls [C]) were ovariectomized (OVX), with or without hormone replacement, or underwent Sham OVX. 5-HT-ir cells were examined in key brainstem areas. Results: Our data support the hypothesis that PAE has long-term effects on the 5-HT system of females and that ovarian steroids have a modulatory role in these effects. Intact (Sham OVX) PAE females had marginally lower numbers of 5-HT-ir neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the brainstem compared with PF and C females. This marginal difference became significant following removal of hormones by OVX. Replacement with E2 restored the number of 5-HT-ir neurons in PAE females to control levels, while P4 reversed the effects of E2. Importantly, despite these differential responses of the 5-HT system to ovarian steroids, there were no differences in E2 and P4 levels among prenatal treatment groups. Conclusions: These data demonstrate long-term, adverse effects of PAE on the 5-HT system of females, as well as differential sensitivity of PAE compared with control females to the modulatory effects of ovarian steroids on 5-HT neurons. Our findings have important implications for understanding sex differences in 5-HT dysfunction in depression/anxiety disorders and the higher rates of these mental health problems in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: The objective of this review is to evaluate the literature on the association between mild, moderate, and binge prenatal alcohol exposure and child neurodevelopment. Methods: Meta-analysis with systematic searches of MEDLINE (1970 through August 2012), EMBASE (1988 through August 2012), and PsycINFO (1970 through August 2012) and examination of selected references. Results: From 1,593 articles, we identified 34 presenting data from cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria. Information on study population, outcomes, measurement instruments, timing and quantification of alcohol exposure, covariates, and results was abstracted. Outcomes included academic performance, attention, behavior, cognition, language skills, memory, and visual and motor development. The quality of each article was assessed by 2 researchers using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Based on 8 studies of 10,000 children aged 6 months through 14 years, we observed a significant detrimental association between any binge prenatal alcohol exposure and child cognition (Cohen's d [a standardized mean difference score] -0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.21, -0.05). Based on 3 high-quality studies of 11,900 children aged 9 months to 5 years, we observed a statistically significant detrimental association between moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and child behavior (Cohen's d -0.15; 95% CI, -0.28, -0.03). We observed a significant, albeit small, positive association between mild-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and child cognition (Cohen's d 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00, 0.08), but the association was not significant after post hoc exclusion of 1 large study that assessed mild consumption nor was it significant when including only studies that assessed moderate alcohol consumption. None of the other completed meta-analyses resulted in statistically significant associations between mild, moderate, or binge prenatal alcohol exposure and child neuropsychological outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings support previous findings suggesting the detrimental effects of prenatal binge drinking on child cognition. Prenatal alcohol exposure at levels less than daily drinking might be detrimentally associated with child behavior. The results of this review highlight the importance of abstaining from binge drinking during pregnancy and provide evidence that there is no known safe amount of alcohol to consume while pregnant. © Published 2013.

N2  - Introduction: It is well established that individuals exposed to alcohol in utero have reduced cortical grey matter volumes. However, the candidate determinants of these reductions, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), have not been investigated exclusively in alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), the most prevalent fetal alcohol spectrum disorder subgroup that lacks the characteristic facial dysmorphology. Methods: T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 88 participants (8-16 years), 36 diagnosed with ARND and 52 typically developing controls. Scans were submitted to the CIVET pipeline (version 1.1.10). Deformable models were used to construct the inner white matter surfaces and pial surfaces from which CT and SA measures were derived. Group differences in cortical volume, CT, and SA were computed using a general linear model covaried for age, sex, and handedness. Results: Global cortical volume reductions in ARND did not reflect CT, which did not differ between groups. Instead, volume decreases were consistent with global SA reductions in bilateral frontal and temporal as well as right occipital regions. Local reductions in SA were observed in the right superior temporal gyrus and the right occipital-temporal region. Conclusion: Results suggest that in ARND, prenatal alcohol exposure perturbs global SA to a greater degree than CT, particularly in the right temporal lobe. © 2013 The Authors.

N2  - Background Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder are heritable but aetiologically complex. Although environment plays a role in their development, existing studies of non-genetic risk factors are inconsistent. Aims To examine the association between pre- and perinatal exposures and Tourette syndrome/chronic tic disorder in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) prospective longitudinal pre-birth cohort. Method Relationships between exposures and Tourette syndrome/chronic tic disorder were examined in 6090 children using logistic regression. Results Maternal alcohol and cannabis use, inadequate maternal weight gain and parity were associated with Tourette syndrome or Tourette syndrome/chronic tic disorder. Other previously reported exposures, including birth weight and prenatal maternal smoking, were not associated with Tourette syndrome/chronic tic disorder. Conclusions This study supports previously reported relationships between Tourette syndrome/chronic tic disorder and prenatal alcohol exposure, and identifies additional previously unexplored potential prenatal risk factors. Declaration of interest C.A.M. and J.M.S. have received travel support from the Tourette Syndrome Association (TSA). C.A.M. is a member of the TSA Medical Advisory Board.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption in western pregnant women is not uncommon and could be a risk factor for childhood atopic disease. However, reported alcohol intake may be unreliable, and associations are likely to be confounded. Objective: We aimed to study the relation between prenatal alcohol exposure and atopic phenotypes in a large population-based birth cohort with the use of a Mendelian randomization approach to minimize bias and confounding. Methods: In white mothers and children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) we first analyzed associations between reported maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and atopic outcomes in the offspring measured at 7 years of age (asthma, wheezing, hay fever, eczema, atopy, and total IgE). We then analyzed the relation of maternal alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)1B genotype (rs1229984) with these outcomes (the A allele is associated with faster metabolism and reduced alcohol consumption and, among drinkers, would be expected to reduce fetal exposure to ethanol). Results: After controlling for confounders, reported maternal drinking in late pregnancy was negatively associated with childhood asthma and hay fever (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per category increase in intake: 0.91 [95% CI, 0.82-1.01] and 0.87 [95% CI, 0.78-0.98], respectively). However, maternal ADH1B genotype was not associated with asthma comparing carriers of A allele with persons homozygous for G allele (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.66-1.47]) or hay fever (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.71-1.72]), nor with any other atopic outcome. Conclusion: We have found no evidence to suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure increases the risk of asthma or atopy in childhood. © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

N2  - To test the effectiveness of motivational interviewing (MI) to reduce the risk of an alcohol exposed pregnancy (AEP) in a high-risk population. Randomized controlled trial. Rural population in the Western Cape, South Africa. A total of 165 women aged 18-44 years at risk of AEP. Five-session MI intervention. Structured questionnaires were administered pre-intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome measure was AEP at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were AEP at 3 months, and alcohol use and effective contraception at 3 and 12 months. There was a significant difference in the decline in the proportion of women at risk for an AEP in the MI group at 3 months (50 versus 24.59%; P = 0.004), maintained at 12 months (50.82 versus 28.12%; P = 0.009). In an intention-to-treat analysis these differences were also significant (32.93 versus 18.07%; P = 0.029; and 37.80 versus 21.69%; P = 0.024, respectively). The odds ratio for no longer being at risk of an AEP (MI versus control) at 12 months was 2.64 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-5.94]. In the intention-to-treat analysis this ratio was 2.19 (95% CI: 1.05-4.65). A five-session motivational interviewing intervention was found to be effective with women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, and could be implemented as part of routine primary care clinic services in similar populations. The message of 'no alcohol in pregnancy' should be adapted to include better family planning and early recognition of pregnancy. © 2012 The Authors, Addiction © 2012 Society for the Study of Addiction.

N2  - Alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) is a significant public health problem in the United States. Sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics serve female clients with a high prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption coupled with ineffective contraceptive use. Project CHOICES (Changing High-Risk AlcOhol Use and Increasing Contraception Effectiveness) is an evidence-based, brief intervention to lower risk of AEP by targeting alcohol and contraceptive behaviors through motivational interviewing and individualized feedback. We describe our experience integrating and implementing CHOICES in STD clinics. This endeavor aligns with CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention's program collaboration and service integration strategic priority to strengthen collaborative work across disease areas and integrate services provided by related programs at the client level. © 2014 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) frequently exhibit impairment on tasks measuring inhibition. The objective of this study was to determine if a performance-based relationship exists between psychometric tests and eye movement tasks in children with FASD. Participants for this dataset were aged 5-17 years and included those diagnosed with an FASD (n= 72), those with PAE but no clinical FASD diagnosis (n= 21), and typically developing controls (n= 139). Participants completed a neurobehavioral test battery, which included the NEPSY-II subtests of auditory attention, response set, and inhibition. Each participant completed a series of saccadic eye movement tasks, which included the antisaccade and memory-guided tasks. Both the FASD and the PAE groups performed worse than controls on the subtest measures of attention and inhibition. Compared with controls, the FASD group made more errors on the antisaccade and memory-guided tasks. Among the combined FASD/PAE group, inhibition and switching errors were negatively correlated with direction errors on the antisaccade task but not on the memory-guided task. There were no significant correlations in the control group. These data suggests that response inhibition deficits in children with FASD/PAE are associated with difficulty controlling saccadic eye movements which may point to overlapping brain regions damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. The results of this study demonstrate that eye movement control tasks directly relate to outcome measures obtained with psychometric tests that are used during FASD diagnosis, and may therefore help with early identification of children who would benefit from a multidisciplinary diagnostic assessment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol consumption is known to adversely affect fetal neurodevelopment. While it is known that alcohol dose and timing play a role in the cognitive and behavioral changes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, it is unclear what developmental processes are disrupted that may lead to these phenotypes. Methods: Mice (n=6 per treatment per developmental time) were exposed to two acute doses of alcohol (5 g/kg) at neurodevelopmental times representing the human first, second, or third trimester equivalent. Mice were reared to adulthood and changes to their adult brain transcriptome were assessed using expression arrays. These were then categorized based on Gene Ontology annotations, canonical pathway associations, and relationships to interacting molecules. Results: The results suggest that ethanol disrupts biological processes that are actively occurring at the time of exposure. These include cell proliferation during trimester one, cell migration and differentiation during trimester two, and cellular communication and neurotransmission during trimester three. Further, although ethanol altered a distinct set of genes depending on developmental timing, many of these show interrelatedness and can be associated with one another via 'hub' molecules and pathways such as those related to huntingtin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Conclusions: These changes to brain gene expression represent a 'molecular footprint' of neurodevelopmental alcohol exposure that is long-lasting and correlates with active processes disrupted at the time of exposure. This study provides further support that there is no neurodevelopmental time when alcohol cannot adversely affect the developing brain. © 2013 Kleiber et al.

N2  - Background: Usually after adoption catch-up growth is observed in children. Objective and hypotheses: We aimed to assess whether this post-adoption catch-up growth is also presented in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. Methods: We measured at arrival and after 1-3 years 64 adopted children from countries of the former USSR. Twenty-nine (45%) presented clinical signs or had a history of prenatal alcohol exposure in utero (FAS/FASD), thirty- five were considered as controls. Height (Ht), BMI and head circumference (HC) data (expressed as SDS), subdivided according to sex, were analyzed and compared within and between the two groups. Results: Ht SDS, BMI SDS and HC SDS were different in the two groups at arrival (p< 0.001) and at follow-up (p< 0.001). Ht SDS values increased from baseline in both groups but was more consistent in controls (p< 0.001 vs. p< 0.05). HC SDS were different in the 2 groups (p< 0.001) at arrival, but while controls showed a mild increase in HC SDS after adoption ( p< 0.05), the FAS/FASD group did not show any change. BMI SDS were significantly different at arrival in the two groups, but did not improve in either group at follow up. A further subdivision of exposed children into severe (FAS, n=10) and mild (FASD, n=19) forms showed that the latter presented a slight improvement in Ht SDS (p< 0.05). Moreover two FAS children, with partial GHD, did not respond to GH therapy. Conclusions: Controls and FAS/FASD children increased significantly their original Ht SDS after arrival. While controls reached a final height within normal range, the FAS/FASD group remained in the lower range (< 10degree centile) and 20% fell below -2 SDS. Controls showed a significant increase in HC SDS while the FAS/FASD group did not. In conclusion, our study demonstrated lack (FAS) or impairment (FASD) of post-adoptive catch-up growth, interestingly both in Ht SDS and HC SDS.

N2  - Background: Concise, accurate measures of maternal prenatal alcohol use are needed to better understand fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Measures of drinking by mothers of children with specific FASD diagnoses and mothers of randomly-selected controls are compared and also correlated with physical and cognitive/behavioral outcomes. Results: Measures of maternal alcohol use can differentiate maternal drinking associated with FASD from that of controls and some from mothers of alcohol-exposed normals. Six variables that combine quantity and frequency concepts distinguish mothers of FASD children from normal controls. Alcohol use variables, when applied to each trimester and three months prior to pregnancy, provide insight on critical timing of exposure as well. Measures of drinking, especially bingeing, correlate significantly with increased child dysmorphology and negative cognitive/behavioral outcomes in children, especially low non-verbal IQ, poor attention, and behavioral problems. Logistic regression links (p< .001) first trimester drinking (vs. no drinking) with FASD, elevating FASD likelihood 12 times; first and second trimester drinking increases FASD outcomes 61 times; and drinking in all trimesters 65 times. Conversely, a similar regression (p= .008) indicates that drinking only in the first trimester makes the birth of a child with an FASD 5 times less likely than drinking in all trimesters. Conclusions: There is significant variation in alcohol consumption both within and between diagnostic groupings of mothers bearing children diagnosed within the FASD continuum. Drinking measures are empirically identified and correlated with specific child outcomes. Alcohol use, especially heavy use, should be avoided throughout pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective: Neuropsychological functioning of individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or heavy prenatal alcohol exposure has been well documented independently. This study examined the interaction between both factors on cognitive performance in children. Method: As part of a multisite study, 344 children (8-16 y, M = 12.28, SD = 2.52) completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Four subject groups were tested: children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) and ADHD (AE+, n = 90), alcohol-exposed without ADHD, (AE-, n = 38), nonexposed with ADHD (ADHD, n = 80), and nonexposed without ADHD (CON, n = 136). Results: Separate 2(AE) x 2(ADHD) MANCOVAs revealed significant main and interactive effects of ADHD and AE on overall WISC-IV, D-KEFS, and CANTAB performance. Individual ANOVAs revealed significant interactions on 2 WISC-IV indices [Verbal Comprehension (VCI), Perceptual Reasoning (PRI)], and four D-KEFS and CANTAB subtests [Design Fluency, Verbal Fluency, Trail Making, Spatial Working Memory]. Follow-up analyses demonstrated no difference between AE+ and AE- groups on these measures. The combined AE+/- group demonstrated more severe impairment than the ADHD group on VCI and PRI, but there were no other differences between clinical groups. Conclusions: These results support a combined AE+/- group for neuropsychological research and indicate that, in some cases, the neuropsychological effects seen in ADHD are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. The effects of alcohol exposure on verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning were greater than those related to having ADHD without alcohol exposure, although both conditions independently resulted in cognitive impairment compared to controls. Clinically, these findings demonstrate task-dependent patterns of impairment across clinical disorders. © 2013 American Psychological Association.

N2  - There are no biological treatments for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), lifelong conditions associated with physical anomalies, brain damage, and neurocognitive abnormalities. In preclinical studies, choline partially ameliorates memory and learning deficits from prenatal alcohol exposure. This phase I pilot study evaluated the feasibility, tolerability, and potential adverse effects of choline supplementation in children with FASD. We hypothesized that choline would be well tolerated with minimal adverse events. The study design was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Participants included 20 children aged 2.5 to 4.9 years with prenatal alcohol exposure and FASD diagnoses. Participants were randomly assigned to 500 mg choline or placebo daily for 9 months (10 active, 10 placebo). Primary outcome measures included feasibility, tolerability, adverse effects, and serum choline levels. Seventeen participants completed the study. Compliance was 82% to 87%, as evidenced by parent-completed log sheets and dose counts. Periodic 24-hour dietary recalls showed no evidence of dietary confounding. Adverse events were minimal and were equivalent in the active and placebo arms with the exception of fishy body odor, which occurred only in the active group. There were no serious adverse events to research participants. This phase I pilot study demonstrates that choline supplementation at 500 mg/d for 9 months in children aged 2 to 5 years is feasible and has high tolerability. Further examination of the efficacy of choline supplementation in FASD is currently underway. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Describe the intellectual performance in a sample of children and adolescents that suffered prenatal exposure of alcohol. Methods: This report constitutes a case series study, comprising 10 subjects between 6 and 16 years old, with a history of fetal alcohol exposure. These subjects underwent a medical evaluation to be characterized as a clinical sample, respecting the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously established. The sample's intellectual performance was studied by means of instruments: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 3rd. Edition (WISC-III) and Raven's Progressive Matrices Test. Results: The sample was evaluated as being of low medium performance by the WISC-III. In the Raven Test the sample exhibited medium intellectual performance. Among all of the WISC-III indexes, Resistance to Distractions was most impaired. The Arithmetic and Picture Arrangement subtests showed more impairment results in comparison of the others subtests. As a secondary consequence, the impairment of these functions can cause difficulties in learning and social interaction and impact the development of these young people. Conclusions: The results of these series of ten cases were compared to those reported in national and international studies. The cognitive impairment caused by alcohol use during pregnancy can manifest in school-age children through learning difficulties and difficulty in establishing social interactions. Thus, prenatal exposure to alcohol becomes a public health issue which needs greater attention from national policies to carry out identification and early intervention.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by excess alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Using an in vitro system, we examined the role that chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure plays in gene expression changes during the early stage of embryonic differentiation. We demonstrated that EtOH affected the cell morphology, cell cycle progression and also delayed the down-regulation of OCT4 and NANOG during differentiation. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis demonstrated that EtOH deregulates many genes and pathways that are involved in early embryogenesis. Follow-up analyzes revealed that EtOH exposure to embryoid bodies (EBs) induced the expression of an organizer-specific gene, goosecoid (GSC), in comparison to controls. Moreover, EtOH treatment altered several important genes that are involved in embryonic structure formation, nervous system development, and placental and embryonic vascularization, which are all common processes that FASD can disrupt. Specifically, EtOH treatment let to a reduction in ALDOC, ENO2 and CDH1 expression, whereas EtOH treatment induced the expression of PTCH1, EGLN1, VEGFA and DEC2 in treated EBs. We also found that folic acid (FA) treatment was able to correct the expression of the majority of genes deregulated by EtOH exposure during early embryo development. Finally, the present study identified a gene set including GSC, which was deregulated by EtOH exposure that may contribute to the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). We also reported that EtOH-induced GSC expression is mediated by Nodal signaling, which may provide a new avenue for analyzing the molecular mechanisms behind EtOH teratogenicity in FASD individuals.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure, especially during early pregnancy, can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome. The pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms of ethanol are related to the effects of ceramide. In this study, we established an alcohol exposure model in wild-type mice and in knockout mice for the key enzyme involved in ceramide metabolism, sphingomyelin synthase 2. This model received daily intragastric administration of 25% ethanol, and pups were used at postnatal days 0, 7, 14, 30 for experiments. Serology and immunofluorescence staining found that ethanol exposure dose-dependently reduced blood sphingomyelin levels in two genotypes of pups, and increased neural cell proliferation and the number of new neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Western blot analysis showed that the relative expression level of protein kinase C alpha increased in two notypes of pups after ethanol exposure. Compared with wild-type pups, the expression level of the important activator protein of the ceramide/ceramide-1-phosphate pathway, protein kinase C alpha, was reduced in the hippocampus of sphingomyelin synthase 2 knockouts. Our findings illustrate that ceramide is involved in alcohol-induced neural proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of pups after prenatal ethanol exposure, and the mechanism may be associated with increased pression of protein kinase C alpha activating the ceramide/ceramide-1-phosphate pathway.

N2  - Background The prevalence of general alcohol use in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is high. However, research examining alcohol use in among pregnant women within this population is limited. A review of the current status of research examining the prevalence of alcohol exposed pregnancies (AEP) is required to inform future research aiming to decrease this occurrence and its subsequent socio-economic complications. Objective The primary objective was to identify all published papers estimating prevalence and risk-factors of alcohol use among pregnant women in SSA. A secondary objective was to determine changes in alcohol use following pregnancy recognition. Methods PubMed/Medline, Embase, IPA, CINAHL were systematically searched using MeSH terms and keywords from inception date to March 2013. Studies from SSA reporting prevalence of alcohol use among pregnant women were included. Results Twelve studies were identified. Studies varied significantly according to design and study population. Prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy ranged from 2.2%-87%. The most important risk-factors for alcohol use included tobacco use, partner violence, urban living, and having a male partner who drank alcohol. Only three studies examined changes in alcohol use prior to and following pregnancy recognition with absolute reductions of between 9% and 15%. Conclusions Although the burden of alcohol use during pregnancy is likely a significant problem, limited data currently exist for the majority of SSA countries. Furthermore, significant variation likely exists within various populations. Further research is required to explore alcohol use in pregnancy. Strategies to decrease AEP must be developed and implemented in standard pre-natal care. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background There is substantial debate as to whether moderate alcohol useduring pregnancy could have subtle but important effects on offspring, by impairing later cognitive function and thus schoolperformance. The authors aimed to investigate the unconfoundedeffect of moderately increased prenatal alcohol exposure oncognitive/educational performance. Methods We used mother-offspring pairs participating in the AvonLongitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and performedboth conventional observational analyses and Mendeliarandomization using an ADH1B variant (rs1229984) associatedwith reduced alcohol consumption. Women of White European origin with genotype and self-reported prenatal alcohol consumption, whose offspring's IQ score had been assessed in clinic (N1/44061 pairs) or Key Stage 2 (KS2) academic achievement score was available through linkage to the National Pupil Database (N1/46268), contributed to the analyses. Results Women reporting moderate drinking before and during early pregnancy were relatively affluent compared with women reporting lighter drinking, and their children had higher KS2 and IQscores. In contrast, children whose mothers' genotype predisposesto lower consumption or abstinence during early pregnancy hadhigher KS2 scores (mean difference 1.7, 95% confidence interval0.4, 3.0) than children of mothers whose genotype predisposed to heavier drinking, after adjustment for population stratification. Conclusions Better offspring cognitive/educational outcomes observed in association with prenatal alcohol exposure presumably reflected residual confounding by factors associated with social position and maternaleducation. The unconfounded Mendelian randomization estimatessuggest a small but potentially important detrimental effect of small increases in prenatal alcohol exposure, at least on educational outcomes. © The Author 2013; all rights reserved.

N2  - Background:The impact of low-to-moderate levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy on child cognitive outcomes has been of recent concern. This study has tested the hypothesis that low-to-moderate maternal alcohol use in pregnancy is associated with lower school test scores at age 11 in the offspring via intrauterine mechanisms.Methods:We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a birth cohort study based in the South West of England. Analyses were conducted on 7062 participants who had complete data on: maternal and paternal patterns of alcohol use in the first trimester and at 18 weeks' gestation, child's academic outcomes measured at age 11, gender, maternal age, parity, marital status, ethnicity, household crowding, home ownership status and parental education. We contrasted the association of mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy with child's National Curriculum Key Stage 2 (KS2) test scores with the association for father's alcohol consumption (during the time the mother was pregnant) with child's National Curriculum Key Stage 2 (KS2) test scores. We used multivariate linear regression to estimate mean differences and 95% confidence intervals [CI] in KS2 scores across the exposure categories and computed f statistics to compare maternal and paternal associations.Findings and conclusions:Drinking up to 1 unit of alcohol a day during pregnancy was not associated with lower test scores. However, frequent prenatal consumption of 4 units (equivalent to 32 grams of alcohol) on each single drinking occasion was associated with reduced educational attainment [Mean change in offspring KS2 score was -0.68 (-1.03, -0.33) for maternal alcohol categories compared to 0.27 (0.07, 0.46) for paternal alcohol categories]. Frequent consumption of 4 units of alcohol during pregnancy may adversely affect childhood academic outcomes via intrauterine mechanisms. © 2013 Alati et al.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are debilitating, with effects of prenatal alcohol exposure persisting into adolescence and adulthood. Complete characterization of FASD is crucial for the development of diagnostic tools and intervention techniques to decrease the high cost to individual families and society of this disorder. In this experiment, we investigated visual system deficits in adolescents (12-21 years) diagnosed with an FASD by measuring the latency of patients' primary visual M100 responses using MEG. We hypothesized that patients with FASD would demonstrate delayed primary visual responses compared to controls. M100 latencies were assessed both for FASD patients and age-matched healthy controls for stimuli presented at the fovea (central stimulus) and at the periphery (peripheral stimuli; left or right of the central stimulus) in a saccade task requiring participants to direct their attention and gaze to these stimuli. Source modeling was performed on visual responses to the central and peripheral stimuli and the latency of the first prominent peak (M100) in the occipital source timecourse was identified. The peak latency of the M100 responses were delayed in FASD patients for both stimulus types (central and peripheral), but the difference in latency of primary visual responses to central vs. peripheral stimuli was significant only in FASD patients, indicating that, while FASD patients' visual systems are impaired in general, this impairment is more pronounced in the periphery. These results suggest that basic sensory deficits in this population may contribute to sensorimotor integration deficits described previously in this disorder. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause alterations to neurodevelopmental brain. Several studies have described difficulties in many cognitive functions and more specifically in IQ, attention and executive functions. Individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure are at increased risk for ADHD. According to the ADHD ethology, children show different cognitive and behavioral profiles. As reported, children with ADHD related to prenatal alcohol consumption show greater severity and incidence of social adjustment difficulties in comparison to idiopathic ADHD. The present study aims to assess working memory as well as behavioral problems in children with FASD/ADHD in comparison with idiopathic ADHD. METHODS: 17 adopted children diagnosed of FASD/ ADHD, age ranged between 6 and 10 years, were compared with 17 idiopathic ADHD children. Both groups were matched by the same subtype of ADHD, age and sex. Working memory was assessed using Digits, Letter and Number and Arithmetic subtests of the WISC-IV. Behavior problems were assessed using the Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist for Parents and Teachers (CBCL). RESULTS: Statistical analysis using T student shows significant differences between both groups in Digits (p <0.004), Letter and number (p <0.003) and Arithmetic (p < 0.000) WISC-IV subtest. In related to behavioral problems, we found only significant differences in social problems subscale in teacher's CBCL (p < 0,037). CONCLUSION: FASD/ADHD children tend to have more cognitive and behavioral problems compared to probable idiopathic ADHD. This profile is the one described in the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. These differences in neuropsychological profile can contribute to improve the differential diagnosis, the intervention and outcome between both groups. We recommend a routine monitoring FASD/ADHD to implement therapeutic interventions as early as possible.

N2  - Background: While much FASD research has focused on sociological, behavioural, and neuro-structural changes, prenatal alcohol exposure also results in long-term alterations in gene expression. A small but growing number of independent international research groups have begun to speculate that the mechanisms underlying the persistence of these changes are Epigenetic marks; Stable but potentially reversible alterations in gene expression that occur without changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Some epigenetic processes are linked to the chromatin (i.e., DNA, histone proteins, and other associated proteins), commonly involve chemical modifications (e.g. methylation) and operate at as on or off switches at the level of transcription, while others (e.g. miRNA) may fine-tune gene expression post-transcriptionally. Results: In our latest research publication (Laufer et al. Disease Models & Mechanisms 2013), we used four ethanol treatment protocols to model developmental ethanol exposure in mice: injections at 3 specific neurodevelopmental time points that model a "binge" exposure, and a voluntary maternal consumption model, which represents a moderate and chronic exposure throughout development. We then assessed small RNA brain gene expression in resulting adult offspring (PD 70) using miRNA expression arrays, gene expression arrays, and qPCR. The analysis revealed that a large number of microRNAs are altered, both up and down, depending on treatment paradigm. Some of these expression profiles are unique to a treatment protocol while others overlap. Strikingly, approximately 20% of the altered noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) localized to three imprinted clusters. The first two, Snrpn-Ube3a (Human 15q11-q13) and Dlk1-Dio3 (Human 14q32.2), are associated with processes involved in neuronal plasticity and several neurodevelopmental disorders that include schizophrenia, autism, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman Syndrome. Next, we assessed brain DNA methylation using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to DNA arrays (MeDIP-Chip), which revealed that even moderate fetal alcohol exposure has a genome-wide effect on DNA methylation, with PTEN/AKT/mTOR/PI3K signaling and imprinted regions of the genome appearing to be particularly sensitive. More recent results from our group have examined the hippocampal formation and confirmed brain region specificity of these results via analysis of gene expression, miRNA and snoRNA regulation, and DNA cytosine methylation. Histone modifications and trans-generational studies are a current avenue of investigation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that imprinted ncRNAs, which play critical roles in neurodevelopment and brain function, may have a role in the long-term maintenance of altered gene expression and cognitive endophenotypes associated with FASD. Discussion: Current research from our group is examining how environmental conditions; both enriched and deprived, affect disease development. This presentation will conclude with our current efforts to translate these results to create a diagnostic molecular profile in humans, which may then be used by clinical researchers to establish therapeutic attenuations, given the highly dynamic nature of epigenetic marks.

N2  - Introduction: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is characterized by Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). IUGR models show dysfunctional maternal uterine vascular adaptations. We hypothesized that chronic binge alcohol during pregnancy impairs uterine artery function via endothelialdependent mechanisms. Methods: A chronic binge alcohol paradigm was followed in the rats (peak blood alcohol concentration, 248 +/- 82.3 mg/dl, gestation day (GD) 7-17 or 19). On the day after the last alcohol exposure, uterine artery function was studied using wire myography. Alteration to endothelial function was also validated using cultured ovine uterine artery endothelial cells (GD 120-130; term = 147) with an alcohol dose and duration similar to the in vivo studies. Results: In rats, no growth deficits were observed on GD 18, whereas by GD 20 fetal body (21%, P=0.002) and placental weights (22%, P=0.001) decreased in the alcohol group. No differences in uterine artery contraction was noted in response to phenylephrine (group effect, P=0.4; logEC50, -6.02+/-0.02 vs. -5.94+/-0.03) or thromboxane (group effect, P=0.73; logEC50, -8.08+/-0.17 vs. -7.98+/-0.17). Further, alcohol did not alter endotheliumindependent SNP-induced relaxation (group effect, P=0.65; logEC50, -7.68+/-0.05 vs. -7.61+/-0.04). Alcohol selectively impaired uterine endothelium-dependent relaxation; acetylcholine significantly decreased vessel relaxation (dose and group main effect, P<0.01; logEC50, -7.02+/-0.14 vs. -6.53+/-0.35; Emax, 14%). Endothelium dysfunction was also noted in uterine endothelial cell culture system; binge alcohol decreased levels of major endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS, rate limiting enzyme for NO vasodilator production) excitatory P635eNOS/total eNOS (23%, P<0.003) compared to the Controls and the related pERK/total ERK signaling (25.7%, P<0.001). Discussion: 1) Chronic binge alcohol has detrimental effects on agonist-mediated endothelium-dependent uterine artery relaxation during pregnancy; 2) These data support that uterine vascular dysfunction precedes FASD growth deficits; 3) Chronic binge alcohol has specific effects on uterine eNOS activity and related signaling; 4) Ongoing studies will investigate role of NO, prostacyclin, and endothelium dependent hyperpolarizing factor in alcohol-induced decreases in uterine vascular function; 5) These findings suggest the involvement of the uterine compartment in FASD pathogenesis.

N2  - Background:In the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland between 30% and 81% of unborn babies are exposed to alcohol in utero. However, evidence on the consequences of prenatal alcohol consumption at low or moderate levels is conflicting and international guidelines have not reached consensus on alcohol recommendations for pregnant women.The aim of this review was to determine the relationship between low to moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure on speech and language development in infants. Search Strategy:Using medical subject headings, PubMed, Web of knowledge, Scopus, Embase, Cinahl, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to February 29th 2012. Case control and cohort studies were included if they compared low or moderate drinking in pregnancy (< 70 grams of alcohol/5 standard drinks per week) to no drinking and reported speech and language outcomes in infants. Two assessors independently reviewed titles, abstracts and fulltext articles, extracted data and assessed quality. Main Results:Three cohort studies [United States (2) and Australia (1)] totaling 10,642 women between 1990 and 2009 met the inclusion criteria. Due to methodological heterogeneity between studies, results could not be combined using meta-analysis. Greene et al. 1990 cohort study included 618 disadvantaged women in Cleveland, USA and reported no association between low alcohol consumption and language outcomes in infants at 1, 2 or 3 years. Faden et al. 2000 cohort study of 8,885 American women reported no association between decreased language achievement at age 3 and mean number of drinks per day in pregnancy. O Leary et al. 2009 cohort study of 1,759 non-indigenous Australian women reported no increased odds of language delay for light drinking in pregnancy. However, studies were judged to be of low quality based on a 6 item bias classification tool. Conclusion:Studies included in this review do not provide sufficient robust evidence to confirm or refute an association between low or moderate alcohol use during pregnancy and speech and language development in infants. There is a need for adequately powered, high quality, population based epidemiological studies. Until such evidence becomes available it remains prudent to advice women to abstain from alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - Alcohol exposure during pregnancy results neurodevelopmental and learning abnormalities and affects 1/100 deliveries. Neuroprotective proteins (NAP,SAL) have been shown to prevent some of the alcohol-induced sequelae including learning abnormalities and growth restriction. Previous work has demonstrated that when evaluated at 30min, 60min and 10days after exposure, phosphorylation of the JNK and p38 cell signaling pathways were affected by alcohol exposure in pregnancy. Given the acute changes in phosphorylation we sought to evaluate the impact of alcohol and NAP+SAL after 5 and 10 minutes of exposure, in cellular signaling pathways involved in stress/cell death (JNK, p38) and those that regulate cellular growth, survival and differentiation (STAT, MAP/ERK, CREB). We used the well characterized Webster mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnancy was identified by vaginal plug and treatment with alcohol, alcohol+NAP,SAL (20ug IP) or placebo(saline) were administered on gestational day 8. Embryos were harvested after 5 or 15min. Cell signaling pathways were studied using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore) and normalized to total protein concentration. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with Fishers post hoc for multiple comparisons; P<.05 significant. Prenatal alcohol exposure affects phosphorylation in the embryo at 5 and 15min with alterations in JNK in the embryo at both timepoints compared with controls (both P<0.01). Pretreatment with NAP+SAL returned levels to control at 15min. Phosphorylation of other pathways although significant at 5min, was not dramatically different, however at 15min a persistent pattern of alterations with alcohol treatment decreasing levels (all P<.01) with no improvement with the peptides, these included CREB, IL1b, p38, p70 and STAT3. Alcohol exposure stimulates the cellular signaling pathways involved in stress/cell death (JNK, p38) decreases those that regulate cellular growth, survival and differentiation. Targeting these pathways may provide an intervention for alcohol induced damage in pregnancy. (Figer Presented) .

N2  - Introduction: A cardinal feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). IUGR models show dysfunctional uterine vascular adaptations. Although alcohol has pregnancy-specific effects on both the maternal systemic & uterine endothelium, large scale quantitative proteomic studies are lacking. Objective: We utilized ITRAQ-label based method & nanoLC MS/MS to quantitate alcohol-induced alterations in the maternal uterine endothelial proteome. Methods: Uterine artery endothelial cells from pregnant ewes (Day 120-130; term=147), were FAC sorted, validated, & cultured. To mimic maternal binging patterns, 4 pairs of cell lines derived from 4 pregnant ewes were treated for 3 h on 3 days in a compensating system without or with alcohol (300 mg/dl) for 2 weeks. Lysates were TCA precipitated, solubilized, trypsin digested before addition of isobaric ITRAQ tags. Following SCX fractionation, samples were analyzed by nano LC MS/MS (MS Bioworks). Data were searched using MASCOT, quantitated & analyzed by Student's t test using Scaffold Q+. Results: Cell viability was unaltered by alcohol. Independent of treatment, a total of 363 proteins were detected with >2 unique peptides/protein & 0% false discovery rate (FDR). Of the 31 proteins significantly (P<0.05) altered by alcohol, 14 were upregulated () & 17 downregulated (). These proteins include those related to cell structure (eg. tubulin beta, P=0.002; vimentin, P<0.001), transcription & translation regulation (eg. elongation factor 1alpha, P<0.001; 40S ribosomal protein S19, P=0.002; calreticulin, P=0.004), histones (eg. H4, P<0.001; H2B-1k, P=0.036), Ca+2/nitric oxide (NO) (eg. HSP90beta, P=0.014; calmodulin, P<0.001), & redox balance (eg. thioredoxin, P=0.017). In addition to 100% FDR in these analyses, we also performed gel based 2-D Dige analysis. Conclusions: 1) This is the first study to utilize the well established ITRAQlabeled technology for proteomic analyses on any cell type in FASD field; 2) Chronic binge alcohol has specific effects on the maternal uterine vasculature at the level of the endothelial proteome; 3) The data support binge alcohol effects at multiple levels including epigenetic, transcriptional & translational; 4) Alcohol has major effects on proteins related to redox balance & Ca+2/NO regulation; & 5) These findings support a role for the uterine compartment in FASD pathogensis.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to a wide range of neurodevelopmental impairments in children and adults including behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In rhesus monkeys, we examined whether moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure would alter acoustic startle responses and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle. PPI is a highly quantifiable measure of inhibitory neural processes or sensorimotor gating associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Methods: Acoustic startle and PPI of the acoustic startle were tested in 37 adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from 4 experimental conditions: (i) moderate-level prenatal alcohol-exposed, (ii) prenatally stressed, (iii) moderate-level prenatal alcohol-exposed + prenatally stressed, and (iv) sucrose controls. Results: Prenatal alcohol-exposed monkeys showed a higher magnitude of acoustic startle response and disrupted PPI compared with monkeys not exposed to alcohol prenatally. Monkeys in all conditions showed higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis responses after undergoing the startle procedure, but HPA responses were unrelated to startle response magnitude, latency, or PPI. Conclusions: Finding altered PPI in monkeys prenatally exposed to a moderate dose of alcohol suggests that reduced sensorimotor gating is 1 effect of prenatal alcohol exposure. Because reduced sensorimotor gating is observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders, sensorimotor gating deficits could be an aspect of the comorbidity between fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and mental health conditions. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Alcohol use disorders (AUD) during pregnancy can have profound lifelong effects on the baby, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Hospital admission for AUD during pregnancy provides an opportunity for intervention. Characterization of women along the AUD spectrum during pregnancy aids the development of prevention strategies, policy, and clinical management guidelines aimed at this population. This study describes the hospital admission levels for AUD between the sixth month before pregnancy and the first year after birth and explores risk factors associated with the hospital admissions. Methods: This study was based on linked population data between 2002 and 2005 using the New South Wales (NSW) Midwives Data Collection (MDC) and the NSW Admitted Patients Data Collection (APDC), Australia. The study subjects included primiparous mothers who were admitted to hospital in the period from the sixth month before pregnancy to 1 year after birth with at least 1 of the following diagnoses (ICD-10-AM): mental and behavioral disorders due to the use of alcohol (MBDA) (F10.0-10.9); toxic effects of alcohol (T51.0-51.9); maternal care for suspected damage to fetus from alcohol (O35.4); or alcohol rehabilitation (Z50.2). Results: A total of 175 new mothers had 287 hospital admissions with the principal or stay AUD diagnoses during the study period in NSW. Of the 287 admissions, 181 admissions (63.07%) were reported for an alcohol-related disorder as the principal diagnosis. The hospital admission rate for AUD was 1.76/1,000 person-years (PY) (95% CI: 1.45 to 2.07) during the 6 months prepregnancy. The rate decreased to 0.49/1,000 PY (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.63) during pregnancy and to 0.82/1,000 PY (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.97) in the first year after birth. Women who smoked during pregnancy, lived in a remote area and were younger than 25 years, were more likely to be admitted to hospital with AUD diagnoses. Women in the middle disadvantaged quintile and born in other countries were less likely to be admitted to hospital with AUD diagnoses. Conclusions: Hospital admission for AUD decreased significantly in pregnancy and the first year postpartum compared to the prepregnancy period. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: While much FASD research has focused on sociological, behavioural, and neuro-structural changes, prenatal alcohol exposure also results in longterm alterations in gene expression. A small but growing number of independent international research groups have begun to speculate that the mechanisms underlying the persistence of these changes are Epigenetic marks; Stable but potentially reversible alterations in gene expression that occur without changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Some epigenetic processes are linked to the chromatin (i.e., DNA, histone proteins, and other associated proteins), commonly involve chemical modifications (e.g. methylation) and operate at as on or off switches at the level of transcription, while others (e.g. miRNA) may fine-tune gene expression post-transcriptionally. Results: In our latest research publication (Laufer et al. Disease Models & Mechanisms 2013), we used four ethanol treatment protocols to model developmental ethanol exposure in mice: injections at 3 specific neurodevelopmental time points that model a "binge" exposure, and a voluntary maternal consumption model, which represents a moderate and chronic exposure throughout development. We then assessed small RNA brain gene expression in resulting adult offspring (PD 70) using miRNA expression arrays, gene expression arrays, and qPCR. The analysis revealed that a large number of microRNAs are altered, both up and down, depending on treatment paradigm. Some of these expression profiles are unique to a treatment protocol while others overlap. Strikingly, approximately 20% of the altered noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) localized to three imprinted clusters. The first two, Snrpn-Ube3a (Human 15q11-q13) and Dlk1-Dio3 (Human 14q32.2), are associated with processes involved in neuronal plasticity and several neurodevelopmental disorders that include schizophrenia, autism, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman Syndrome. Next, we assessed brain DNA methylation using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to DNA arrays (MeDIP-Chip), which revealed that even moderate fetal alcohol exposure has a genome-wide effect on DNA methylation, with PTEN/AKT/mTOR/PI3K signaling and imprinted regions of the genome appearing to be particularly sensitive. More recent results from our group have examined the hippocampal formation and confirmed brain region specificity of these results via analysis of gene expression, miRNA and snoRNA regulation, and DNA cytosine methylation. Histone modifications and trans-generational studies are a current avenue of investigation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that imprinted ncRNAs, which play critical roles in neurodevelopment and brain function, may have a role in the long-term maintenance of altered gene expression and cognitive endophenotypes associated with FASD. Discussion: Current research from our group is examining how environmental conditions; both enriched and deprived, affect disease development. This presentation will conclude with our current efforts to translate these results to create a diagnostic molecular profile in humans, which may then be used by clinical researchers to establish therapeutic attenuations, given the highly dynamic nature of epigenetic marks.

N2  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on central nervous system function include an increased prevalence of mental health problems, including substance use disorders (SUD). The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and dopamine (DA) systems have overlapping neurocircuitries and are both implicated in SUD. PAE alters both HPA and dopaminergic activity and regulation, resulting in increased HPA tone and an overall reduction in tonic DA activity. However, effects of PAE on the interaction between HPA and DA systems have not been investigated. The present study examined PAE effects on basal regulation of central stress and DA systems in key brain regions where these systems intersect. Adult Sprague-Dawley male and female offspring from prenatal alcohol-exposed (PAE), pairfed (PF), and ad libitum-fed control (C) groups were subjected to chronic variable stress (CVS) or remained as a no stress (non-CVS) control group. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA, as well as glucocorticoid and DA receptor (DA-R) expression were measured under basal conditions 24. h following the end of CVS. We show, for the first time, that regulation of basal HPA and DA systems, and likely, HPA-DA interactions, are altered differentially in males and females by PAE and CVS. PAE augmented the typical attenuation in weight gain during CVS in males and caused increased weight loss in females. Increased basal corticosterone levels in control, but not PAE, females suggest that PAE alters the profile of basal hormone secretion throughout CVS. CVS downregulated basal CRH mRNA in the prefrontal cortex and throughout the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in PAE females but only in the posterior BNST of control females. PAE males and females exposed to CVS exhibited more widespread upregulation of basal mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA throughout the hippocampus, and an attenuated decrease in DA-R expression throughout the nucleus accumbens and striatum compared to CVS-exposed control males and females. Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of PAE effects on the cross-talk between HPA and DA systems, and provide insight into possible mechanisms underlying mental health problems that are related to stress and DA signaling, including SUD, which have a high prevalence among individuals with FASD. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: The Lililwan Project is the first population-based study to determine Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) prevalence in Australia and was conducted in the remote Fitzroy Valley in North Western Australia. The diagnostic process for FASD requires accurate assessment of gross and fine motor functioning using standardised cut-offs for impairment. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2) is a norm-referenced assessment of motor function used worldwide and in FASD clinics in North America. It is available in a Complete Form with 53 items or a Short Form with 14 items. Its reliability in measuring motor performance in children exposed to alcohol in utero or living in remote Australian Aboriginal communities is unknown.Methods: A prospective inter-rater and test-retest reliability study was conducted using the BOT-2 Short Form. A convenience sample of children (n = 30) aged 7 to 9 years participating in the Lililwan Project cohort (n = 108) study, completed the reliability study. Over 50% of mothers of Lililwan Project children drank alcohol during pregnancy. Two raters simultaneously scoring each child determined inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was determined by assessing each child on a second occasion using predominantly the same rater. Reliability was analysed by calculating Intra-Class correlation Coefficients, ICC(2,1), Percentage Exact Agreement (PEA) and Percentage Close Agreement (PCA) and measures of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were calculated.Results: Thirty Aboriginal children (18 male, 12 female: mean age 8.8 years) were assessed at eight remote Fitzroy Valley communities. The inter-rater reliability for the BOT-2 Short Form score sheet outcomes ranged from 0.88 (95%CI, 0.77 - 0.94) to 0.92 (95%CI, 0.84 - 0.96) indicating excellent reliability. The test-retest reliability (median interval between tests being 45.5 days) for the BOT-2 Short Form score sheet outcomes ranged from 0.62 (95%CI, 0.34 - 0.80) to 0.73 (95%CI, 0.50 - 0.86) indicating fair to good reliability. The raw score MDC was 6.12.Conclusion: The BOT-2 Short Form has acceptable reliability for use in remote Australian Aboriginal communities and will be useful in determining motor deficits in children exposed to alcohol prenatally. This is the first known study evaluating the reliability of the BOT-2 Short Form, either in the context of assessment for FASD or in Aboriginal children. © 2013 Lucas et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Brief, effective interventions are needed to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy in women who drink and do not use effective contraception. The Healthy Choices study compared telephone and in-person administration of a brief intervention. In addition to indicators of alcohol use and effective contraception, compliance with the intervention was examined. Women between the ages of 18 and 44 who were drinking above recommended levels and not using effective contraception were randomly assigned to either a telephone (n= 68) or in-person (n= 63) brief (two sessions) intervention. Overall, participants showed small but significant reductions in alcohol use and larger increases in effective use of contraception. Risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancy was thus significantly reduced, largely due to improved contraception with minor reductions in alcohol use. There was no significant difference in success of the intervention between the two conditions (telephone versus in-person). These findings suggest telephone-based brief intervention may be equally successful and cost-effective in reducing the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy and thus fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2013.

N2  - Background To determine the effects in adult offspring of maternal exposure to stress and alcohol during pregnancy, we imaged striatal and midbrain dopamine transporter (DAT) binding by positron emission tomography in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We also evaluated the relationship between DAT binding and behavioral responses previously found to relate to dopamine D2 receptor density (responsivity to tactile stimuli, performance on a learning task, and behavior during a learning task). Methods Subjects were adult offspring derived from a 2 x 2 experiment in which pregnant monkeys were randomly assigned to control, daily mild stress exposure (acoustic startle), voluntary consumption of moderate-level alcohol, or both daily stress and alcohol. Adult offspring (n = 38) were imaged by positron emission tomography with the DAT ligand [ 18F]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-fluoroethyl) -nortropane ([18F]FECNT). Results Results showed that prenatal stress yielded an overall increase of 15% in [18F]FECNT binding in the striatum (p =.016), 17% greater binding in the putamen (p =.012), and 13% greater binding in the head of the caudate (p =.028) relative to animals not exposed to prenatal stress. Striatal [18F]FECNT binding correlated negatively with habituation to repeated tactile stimulation and positively with tactile responsivity. There were no significant effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on [18F]FECNT binding. Conclusions Maternal exposure to mild daily stress during pregnancy yielded increases in striatal DAT availability that were apparent in adult offspring and were associated with behavioral characteristics reflecting tactile hyperresponsivity, a condition associated with problem behaviors in children. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

N2  - The failure of education to significantly reduce the incidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome has made it important to understand the mechanisms in order to develop preventative or ameliorative strategies. Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to be associated with altered fetal blood flow, oxidative stress and growth restriction that can persist into adolescence. Low birth weight is also associated with altered development and programming which can have lifelong consequences. Glutamine has been linked with fetal nitrogen and carbon metabolism, synthesis of the cellular anti-oxidant glutathione, and apoptosis suppression. It is a precursor for the synthesis of other amino acids, endothelial-dependent relaxation, and increases in protein synthesis and is used clinically as a nutrient supplement in low birth weight infants. We hypothesized that chronic third trimester-equivalent prenatal alcohol exposure would decrease the bioavailability of amino acids, hamper fetal body growth, increase fetal cerebellar oxidative stress, and alter fetal blood flow; a corollary hypothesis was that maternal L-glutamine supplementation may improve these negative developmental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to 4 groups: saline control, glutamine (GLN) control, alcohol or alcohol + GLN. Alcohol or saline infusions were given intravenously (IV) over 1 h from gestation day (GD) 109 to 132 or from GD99 to 121, 3 consecutive days per week to mimic a weekend binge drinking pattern. 100 mg/kg of GLN dose was administered IV as a 4.5 %w/v aqueous bolus three times a day. Third trimester equivalent prenatal alcohol exposure reduced fetal weight and height and also increased the ponderal index compared to the control group; these parameters were significantly improved in the alcohol + GLN group compared to the alcohol group. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreased fetal plasma concentrations of arginine, aspartate, glutamine, taurine and tyrosine; maternal glutamine supplementation improved the bioavailability of amino acids in both the maternal and fetal compartments. We observed a decrease in oxidized glutathione in maternal hemocytes and the fetal cerebellum for the alcohol + GLN group compared to the alcohol group. Fetal cerebellar blood flow was significantly increased in the alcohol group, hence increasing the cerebellar alcohol delivery. This alcohol-induced increase in fetal cerebellar blood flow was mitigated in the alcohol + GLN group. In summary, maternal glutamine supplementation improved amino acid bioavailability, fetal growth and endogenous antioxidant levels in alcohol exposed fetuses. Thus, glutamine shows great potential as a therapeutic or intervention strategy for the negative effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Associations between multivitamin supplement use and alcohol consumption before pregnancy: Pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system, 2004 to 2008
A1  - Weiss L.A.
A1  - Chambers C.D.
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: Approximately 50 to 70% of childbearing-aged women consume alcohol and up to 23% of pregnancies have some level of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System from 2004 to 2008, 111,644 women who completed questions relating to periconceptional alcohol use and multivitamin supplement use were included in the study. This study explored associations between periconceptional alcohol use and multivitamin supplementation use. Weighted multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations, adjusting for maternal education, maternal ethnicity, maternal age, household income, and parity. Results: During the periconceptional period, a dose-dependent association was found where women who consumed alcohol (<3 drinks/wk, odds ratio [OR] = 0.76; 4 to 6 drinks/wk, OR = 0.60; 7 to 13 drinks/wk, OR = 0.49; >14 drinks/wk, OR = 0.39) and binged on alcohol (1 time, OR = 0.76; 2 to 3 times, OR = 0.66; 4 to 5 times, OR = 0.56; >6 times, OR = 0.50) were significantly less likely to take a multivitamin supplement compared with those that did not consume alcohol. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the importance of periconceptional multivitamin supplement use, especially among alcohol-consuming women of childbearing age. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is a major, preventable cause of neurobehavioral dysfunction in children worldwide. The measurement and quantification of saccadic eye movements is a powerful tool for assessing sensory, motor, and cognitive function. The quality of the motor process of an eye movement is known as saccade metrics. Saccade accuracy is 1 component of metrics, which to function optimally requires several cortical brain structures as well as an intact cerebellum and brain-stem. The cerebellum has frequently been reported to be damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. This study, therefore, tested the hypothesis that children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) will exhibit deficits in the accuracy of saccades. Methods: A group of children with FASD (n = 27) between the ages of 8 and 16 and typically developing control children (n = 27) matched for age and sex, completed 3 saccadic eye movement tasks of increasing difficulty. Eye movement performance during the tasks was captured using an infrared eye tracker. Saccade metrics (e.g., velocity, amplitude, accuracy) were quantified and compared between the 2 groups for the 3 different tasks. Results: Children with FASD were more variable in saccade endpoint accuracy, which was reflected by statistically significant increases in the error of the initial saccade endpoint and the frequency of additional, corrective saccades required to achieve final fixation. This increased variability in accuracy was amplified when the cognitive demand of the tasks increased. Children with FASD also displayed a statistically significant increase in response inhibition errors. Conclusions: These data suggest that children with FASD may have deficits in eye movement control and sensory-motor integration including cerebellar circuits, thereby impairing saccade accuracy. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Early identification of and intervention for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has been shown to optimize outcomes for affected individuals. Detecting biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in neonates may assist in the identification of children at risk of FASD enabling targeted early interventions. Despite these potential benefits, complicated ethical issues arise in screening for biomarkers of PAE and these must be addressed prior to the implementation of screening programs. Here, we identify and comment, based on a North American perspective, on concerns raised in the current ethical, social, and legal literature related to meconium screening for PAE. Major ethical concerns revolve around the targeting of populations for PAE screening, consent and respect for persons, stigma and participation rates, the cost-benefit analysis of a screening program, consequences of false-positive and false-negative test results, confidentiality and appropriate follow-up to positive screen results, and the use of screen results for criminal prosecution. We identify gaps in the literature on screening for PAE, most notably related to a lack of stakeholder perspectives (e.g., parents, healthcare providers) about screening and the ethical challenges it presents. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines the relationships between the dose, pattern, and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and achievement in reading, writing, spelling, and numeracy in children aged 8 to 9 years. METHODS: Data from a randomly selected, population-based birth cohort of infants born to non-Indigenous women in Western Australia between 1995 and 1997 (n = 4714) (Randomly Ascertained Sample of Children born in Australia's Largest State Study cohort) were linked to the Western Australian Midwives' Notification System and the Western Australian Literacy and Numeracy Assessment statewide education testing program. The records for 86% (n = 4056) of the cohort were successfully linked with education records when the children were aged 8 to 9 years. The associations between prenatal alcohol exposure and achievement of national benchmarks in school numeracy, reading, spelling, and writing tests and nonattendance for the tests was examined. Logistic regression was used to generate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for potential confounding factors. The referent group included children of mothers who previously drank alcohol but who abstained during pregnancy. RESULTS: Children were twice as likely not to achieve the benchmark for reading after heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during the first trimester (aOR 2.26; 95% CI 1.10-4.65) and for writing when exposed to occasional binge drinking in late pregnancy (aOR 2.35; 95% CI 1.04-5.43). Lowmoderate prenatal alcohol exposure was not associated with academic underachievement. CONCLUSIONS: The type of learning problems expressed depends on the dose, pattern, and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure. Copyright © 2013 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, can result in craniofacial dysmorphism, cognitive impairment, sensory and motor disabilities among other defects. FASD incidences are as high as 2% to 5 % children born in the US, and prevalence is higher in low socioeconomic populations. Despite various mechanisms being proposed to explain the etiology of FASD, the molecular targets of ethanol toxicity during development are unknown. Proposed mechanisms include cell death, cell signaling defects and gene expression changes. More recently, the involvement of several other molecular pathways was explored, including non-coding RNA, epigenetic changes and specific vitamin deficiencies. These various pathways may interact, producing a wide spectrum of consequences. Detailed understanding of these various pathways and their interactions will facilitate the therapeutic target identification, leading to new clinical intervention, which may reduce the incidence and severity of these highly prevalent preventable birth defects. This review discusses manifestations of alcohol exposure on the developing central nervous system, including the neural crest cells and sensory neural placodes, focusing on molecular neurodevelopmental pathways as possible therapeutic targets for prevention or protection. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the effect of teratogeny and cell apoptosis on retina after prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Methods: A total of 72 mouse models of prenatal alcohol exposure were made. HE staining and immunofluorescent labeling were carried out to visualize the retinal pathology and cell apoptosis. Results: High prenatal alcohol exposure increased the rate of retinal malformation; The expression of positive cells in inner granular layer(INL) was costistent with ganglial cell layer(GCL) in the retina with dose-dependency (P < 0.05) ; TUNEL showed in the retina INL and GCL, alcohol induced the cell apoptosis with long-range effects (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Retinal malformation and cell apoptosis probably are the cause of eye diseases induced by PAE.

N2  - Alcohol (ethanol) consumption in pregnancy is the etiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), a leading cause of congenital disability worldwide. Hence, any attempt to prevent or manage FASD must start from comprehensive understanding of alcohol consumption by women in general, and by women of reproductive years in particular.

N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is known to adversely affect fetal neurodevelopment. While it is known that alcohol dose and timing play a role in the cognitive and behavioural changes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, it is unclear what molecular neurodevelopmental processes are disrupted that may lead to these phenotypes. Methods: Mice (n=6 per treatment per developmental time) were exposed to an acute dose of alcohol (5 g/kg) at a neurodevelopmental time representing the human first, second, or third trimester equivalent. Mice were reared to adulthood and changes to their adult brain transcriptome were assessed using expression arrays. These were then categorized based on Gene Ontology annotations, canonical pathway associations, and relationships to interacting molecules. Results: The results suggest that ethanol disrupts biological processes that are actively occurring at the time of exposure. These include cell proliferation during trimester one, cell migration and differentiation during trimester two, and cellular communication and neurotransmission during trimester three. Further, although ethanol altered a distinct set of genes depending on developmental timing, many of these show interrelatedness and can be associated with one another via "hub" molecules and pathways such as those related to Huntingtin and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Conclusions: These changes to brain gene expression represent a "molecular footprint" of neurodevelopmental alcohol exposure that is long-lasting and correlates with active processes disrupted at the time of exposure. This study provides further support that there is no neurodevelopmental time when alcohol cannot adversely affect the developing brain.

N2  - Background: Human brain structure continues to change through adolescence consistent with developmental changes in brain structure contributing to maturation of brain function. Methods: We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate trajectories of brain change in typically developing children and adolescents, and in children and adolescents with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Further, we examined relationships between changes in brain structure over time and measures of cognitive function. Results: Typically developing individuals showed an inverted-U shaped developmental trajectory of cortical development which varied by region. Generally, the timing of development follows a caudal to rostral pattern where the most superior and anterior portions of the brain show the slowest trajectory. Changes in the brain over time are related to improved performance on cognitive tests. Children with PAE show very different trajectories of brain development where they exhibit the cortical volume decline across the entire age span studied (7 to 18 years), without the increase in the earlier years followed by declines in early adolescence observed in their unexposed peers. Conclusions: Cortical development observed on MRI is thought to reflect finetuning of neural systems which prune un-needed inefficient connections, and enhance connections with increased myelination which quickens transduction speed across axonal fibers. These processes are frequently referred to as experience dependent plasticity, which is altered over time in children and adolescents with PAE, long after the prenatal insults to the brain.

T1  - Cholecalciferol attenuates perseverative behavior associated with developmental alcohol exposure in rats in a dose-dependent manner
A1  - Idrus N.M.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Alcohol is a known teratogen that is estimated to affect 2-5% of the births in the U.S. Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce physical features such as facial dysmorphology, physiological alterations such as cell loss in the central nervous system (CNS), and behavioral changes that include hyperactivity, cognitive deficits, and motor dysfunction. The range of effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure is referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Despite preventative measures, some women continue to drink while pregnant. Therefore, identifying interventions that reduce the severity of FASD is critical. This study investigated one such potential intervention, vitamin D3, a nutrient that exerts neuroprotective properties. The present study determined whether cholecalciferol, a common vitamin D3 nutritional supplement, could serve as a means of mitigating alcohol-related learning deficits. Using a rat model of FASD, cholecalciferol was given before, during, and after 3rd trimester equivalent alcohol exposure. Three weeks after cholecalciferol treatment, subjects were tested on a serial spatial discrimination reversal learning task. Animals exposed to ethanol committed significantly more errors compared to controls. Cholecalciferol treatment reduced perseverative behavior that is associated with developmental alcohol exposure in a dose-dependent manner. These data have important implications for the treatment of FASD and suggest that cholecalciferol may reduce some aspects of FASD. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: Chronic prenatal alcohol exposure can injure the developing brain, and is associated with a variety of physiological and behavioural postnatal anomalies, collectively referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Included among the anomalies is a markedly increased prevalence of seizures. To date, there exists limited information regarding the underlying mechanisms. The hippocampus is a structure implicated in the FASD and is a source of seizure activity in a variety of epileptic conditions. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in mice on the physiology and seizure susceptibility of the hippocampus. Method: Pregnant mice received 10% v/v ethanol for the first trimester of gestation by voluntary consumption. Extracellular field potentials were recorded from the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions using acute brain slices prepared from control and ethanol-exposed pups of age PD 15 to PD 21. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure for the first trimester resulted in an increase of spontaneous field activity in both the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions. These spontaneous discharges consist of depolarizing shifts of 0.2-1 mV in amplitude and 30-150 ms in duration, which were blocked by the addition of the gap junctional communication antagonist, carbenoxolone. Furthermore, prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in an increase in spontaneous and recurrent seizures in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions. Along with the physiological changes we observed molecular changes in FASD mice, including up-regulation of connexin 30 mRNA and connexin 30 protein compared to age-matched controls. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that exposure of the developing brain to alcohol results in abnormal physiological and molecular changes and an increase in seizure susceptibility in the hippocampus.

N2  - Presentation A 32-year-old woman booked her second pregnancy at the local district hospital. Her first pregnancy and delivery were unremarkable. Investigation The anomaly scan was undertaken at 20 weeks and 2 days, where all measurements were found to be on the fifth centile. A referral was made to the Consultant Obstetrician, and serial scans demonstrated the growth velocity to be maintained on the fifth centile, but the head circumference well below the third centile at 21, 23 and 26 week scans. Uterine dopplers were normal, as were liquor volume and umbilical dopplers. A fetal echocardiogram was performed. An amniocentesis was normal. A fetal brain MRI was undertaken at 28 weeks, which demonstrated delayed sulcation and a small brain. After counselling, the couple opted for a fetocide, followed by induction at 33 weeks, and a male infant was born weighing 1075 g and head circumference of 25 cm. A minimally invasive postmortem revealed normal development, other than isolated microcephaly with an immature brain for gestational age, of undetermined aetiology. Discussion Microcephaly is defined when the head circumference is measured to be smaller than expected for gestational age. The threshold at which diagnosis is made varies between authors; it is usually defined as a head perimeter measurement of -3 SD or less below the mean. Minus 2 SD is also sometimes used but will incorporate a proportion of fetuses with a small head circumference but normal development. It is primarily a disorder of cell proliferation in the cortex rather than the bones of the cranium. The forebrain is most affected and there can be other associated abnormalities including asymmetries and atrophy of the basal ganglia. The diagnosis is primarily pathogenetic. Once the diagnosis has been made, other abnormalities are sought as microcephaly may exist as part of a syndrome or an isolated finding. The causes of microcephaly include chromosomal abberations and gene defects, the result of infection (such as rubella, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis) and environmental toxins including fetal alcohol syndrome. A family history of microcephaly or other possible genetic syndromes should be taken, along with a history of exposure to viral illness and alcohol consumption. Conclusion Diagnosis on ultrasound can be challenging, and accurate gestational age is required. Head perimeter is used, and the cranial vault appears small compared with the facial bones. The forehead may have a sloping appearance. Dilated lateral ventricles can also suggest microcephaly in the context of borderline head perimeter.

N2  - Aims:This study aimed 1. to examine the prevalence of German children born with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) from 1985 to 2005, and asked 2. whether it differed on levels of socioeconomic status (SES) and 3. whether there are differences between abstainers and drinkers during pregnancy in regard to physical, behavioural and sociodemographic features. Methods: 16 978 German mothers, enrolled in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey (KiGGS) were studied. Results: Between 1985 and 2005 13.5 percent of the children were born with PAE. No stable decrease was found over time. Over 20 years, the prevalence of children born with PAE was highest in the upper class. Drinkers differed from abstainers in regard to physical, behavioural and sociodemographic characteristics. High SES women were on a higher risk of alcohol intake during pregnancy. Conclusions: The prevalence of children born with PAE over time indicates that alcohol intake during pregnancy needs further interventions and prevention as no long-lasting decrease was found in the years from 1985 to 2005. Alcohol intake during pregnancy was and still is an issue in women from the upper class. Future research should therefore aim to explain the social gradient. © 2013 Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG, Bern.

N2  - To determine prevalence of prenatal alcohol use in Brazzaville, Congo and to evaluate a prenatal screening tool for use in this population. Methods: A prospective population screening program of 3099 women at 10 prenatal care clinics in Brazzaville, Congo using the 1-Question screen. To validate the 1-Question screen in this population we screened 764 of these women again using the T-ACE as a gold standard for comparison study. The study outcomes were as follows: prevalence of self-reported prenatal alcohol use in Brazzaville using the 1-Question screen, estimation of number of drinking days, drinks per drinking day, most drinks on any one occasion. We also estimated the epidemiologic performance criteria for the 1-Question screen. Results: The 3099 women screened were classified as follows: no risk 77% (n=2,384); at risk 3.7% (n=115); and as high risk 19.3% (n=600). Of the women reporting drinking during pregnancy, 87.4% reported drinking 4 or more drinks on any occasion. The agreement for detection of alcohol use during pregnancy by the 1-Question Screen and a positive T-ACE score was 94.7%. Conclusions: 23.3% of women attending prenatal care in Brazzaville reported alcohol use during pregnancy and 83% of them continued to drink after recognition of pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol exposure should be the focus of efforts to improve identification of alcohol use prior to and during pregnancy to improve maternal and child health.

T1  - Dental hospital admissions in the children of mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis: A population-based, data-linkage study
A1  - O'Leary C.M.
A1  - Slack-Smith L.M.
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Objective: To investigate the relationship between maternal alcohol-use disorder and dental hospital admissions in children up to 5 years of age. Study design: Mothers with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision/10th revision alcohol-related diagnosis, a proxy for alcohol-use disorder, were identified through the Western Australian data-linkage system. Exposed mothers were frequency-matched by maternal age, Aboriginal status, and child's birth year to randomly selected comparison mothers without an alcohol diagnosis. Linkage with the Midwives Notification System (1983-2002) identified all births of these mothers; "exposed" (non-Aboriginal, n = 11 171; Aboriginal, n = 8145) and comparison cohorts (non-Aboriginal, n = 32 508; Aboriginal, n = 16 719). Dental hospital admissions were identified through linkage with Hospital Morbidity Data (1983-2007) (3.2% exposed; 3.0% comparison) and cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (n = 84) through linkage with the Western Australian Register of Developmental Anomalies. ORs and 95% CIs for having a dental admission (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision: 520-529; International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision: K0-K14.9) were generated by the use of generalized estimating equations, which we adjusted for potential confounding factors (aOR). Results: Children of mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis had increased adjusted odds of gingivitis and periodontal diseases (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.12-2.51) and "other" diseases of the lip and oral mucosa (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.21-2.01). Diseases of the salivary glands were increased only in Aboriginal children of mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis (aOR 2.65; 95% CI 1.09-6.44). Children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome had increased ORs of any dental admission (aOR 2.58; 95% CI 1.30-5.11). Conclusions: Maternal alcohol-use disorder was associated with dental admissions related to disorders of the soft tissues, but questions remain regarding perinatal influences on dental admissions and disease.

N2  - Aims: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a very common and completely avoidable disease caused by intrauterine alcohol exposition. FAS has severe consequences not only for the individual and its direct environment but also for the health and social system in Germany. The first aim of the project is the determination of evidence-based, clinically relevant and implementable diagnostic criteria for the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome in children and adolescents in Germany. With help of the defined diagnostic criteria of FAS the disorder can be diagnosed and treated earlier, so secondary disorders can be reduced. The second aim is to create awareness in the German society about the severe complications of alcohol use in pregnancy in order to reduce the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and diminish the incidence of FAS. Methods: A steering group in Munich and a consensus group consisting of representatives of the German Federal Ministry of Health, the German Professional Societies and other FAS experts have been established in 2011. Representatives of the Patient Support Group FASworld are also members of the consensus group. For the methodological guidance the AWMF (Consortium of the scientific medical societies) is responsible and the literature evaluation is conducted by the AZQ (Center for Quality in Medicine). Results: The consensus group defined a key question and specific issues for the literature search. The evaluation of the literature is in progress. The methodological quality of the international and especially the German publications about the diagnostic criteria are rather poor. Most of the existing international guidelines for the diagnosis of FAS are consensus- but not evidence-based. Conclusion: There is great need for a standardized, multidisciplinary, quality assured and implementable prevention of FAS in Germany. The first step is the establishment of evidence- and consensus-based diagnostic criteria for children with FAS which will be approved and presented in 2012.

N2  - Alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) are the direct cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). This study examines drinking patterns among pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing age in Russia, a country with one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world. Cross-sectional survey. Seven public women's clinics in two locations: St Petersburg (SPB) and the Nizhny Novgorod region (NNR). A total of 648 pregnant and non-pregnant childbearing-age women. A face-to-face structured interview assessed alcohol consumption, pregnancy status/possibility of becoming pregnant and consumption before and after pregnancy recognition. Eighty-nine per cent of non-pregnant women reported consuming alcohol and 65% reported binge drinking in the past 3 months; 47% in NNR and 28% in SPB reported binges at least monthly. Women who might become pregnant consumed alcohol similarly to women who were not likely to become pregnant, and 32% of women in SPB and 54% in NNR were categorized as at risk for AEP. There was a significant decline in drinking after pregnancy identification. Twenty per cent of pregnant women reported consuming alcohol and 6% in SBP (none in NNR) reported binge drinking; however, a high prevalence of binge drinking was found among women who might become pregnant or who were trying to conceive. Russian women substantially reduce drinking after pregnancy recognition compared to pre-pregnancy levels. No reductions were found prior to pregnancy recognition, either when a woman might become pregnant or when she was trying to conceive. The pre-conception period presents a risk window and, therefore, a prevention opportunity. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.

N2  - The transcription factors Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog regulate within a narrow dose-range embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency and cell lineage commitment. Excess of Oct4 relative to Sox2 guides cells to mesoendoderm (ME), while abundance of Sox2 promotes neuroectoderm (NE) formation. Literature does not address whether ethanol interferes with these regulatory interactions during neural development. We hypothesized that ethanol exposure of ES cells in early differentiation causes an imbalance of Oct4 and Sox2 that diverts cells away from NE to ME lineage, consistent with the teratogenesis effects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Mouse ES cells were exposed to ethanol (0, 25, 50, and 100 mM) during retinoic acid (10 nM)-directed differentiation to NE for 0-6 days, and the expression of Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog was measured in single live cells by multiparametric flow cytometry, and the cellular phenotype was characterized by immunocytochemistry. Our data showed an ethanol dose-and time-dependent asymmetric modulation of Oct4 and Sox2 expression, as early as after 2 days of exposure. Single-cell analysis of the correlated expression of Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog revealed that ethanol promoted distinct subpopulations with a high Oct4/Sox2 ratio. Ethanol-exposed cells differentiated to fewer beta-III tubulin-immunoreactive cells with an immature neuronal phenotype by 4 days. We interpret these data as suggesting that ethanol diverted cells in early differentiation from the NE fate toward the ME lineage. Our results provide a novel insight into the mode of ethanol action and opportunities for discovery of prenatal biomarkers at early stages. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Human birth defects are highly variable and this phenotypic variability can be influenced by both the environment and genetics. However, the synergistic interactions between these two variables are not well understood. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is the umbrella term used to describe the wide range of deleterious outcomes following prenatal alcohol exposure. Although FASD are caused by prenatal ethanol exposure, FASD are thought to be genetically modulated, although the genes regulating sensitivity to ethanol teratogenesis are largely unknown. To identify potential ethanol-sensitive genes, we tested five known craniofacial mutants for ethanol sensitivity: cyp26b1, gata3, pdgfra, smad5 and smoothened. We found that only platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (pdgfra) interacted with ethanol during zebrafish craniofacial development. Analysis of the PDGF family in a human FASD genome-wide dataset links PDGFRA to craniofacial phenotypes in FASD, prompting a mechanistic understanding of this interaction. In zebrafish, untreated pdgfra mutants have cleft palate due to defective neural crest cell migration, whereas pdgfra heterozygotes develop normally. Ethanol-exposed pdgfra mutants have profound craniofacial defects that include the loss of the palatal skeleton and hypoplasia of the pharyngeal skeleton. Furthermore, ethanol treatment revealed latent haploinsufficiency, causing palatal defects in ~62% of pdgfra heterozygotes. Neural crest apoptosis partially underlies these ethanol-induced defects in pdgfra mutants, demonstrating a protective role for Pdgfra. This protective role is mediated by the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Collectively, our results suggest a model where combined genetic and environmental inhibition of PI3K/mTOR signaling leads to variability within FASD. © 2013.

T1  - A potential molecular target for morphological defects of fetal alcohol syndrome: Kir2.1
A1  - Bates E.A.
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a developmental disorder that affects up to 0.2% of births. FASD comprises severe cognitive and structural birth defects including cleft lip/palate, small jaw, wide-set eyes, dental abnormalities, digit abnormalities, small head, and short stature. Strict counseling guidelines stress abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy, but the prevalence of FASD persists. The lack of a convincing molecular target has hindered FASD research and treatment. Interestingly, mutations in an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1, cause a similar constellation of birth defects as in FASD. In other words, FASD phenocopies the traits conveyed by Kir2.1 mutations. Furthermore, alcohol directly binds to and modulates Kir2.1. Substantial evidence now suggests that alcohol targets Kir2.1 to cause the birth defects associated with FASD. This review compiles clinical, genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological, and molecular evidence that identifies Kir2.1 as a molecular target for FASD development and possibly therapeutic treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - A derived peptide from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) has been shown to be neuroprotective in the fetal alcohol exposure model. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 against alcohol-induced apoptosis using TUNEL staining. We further characterize in this study the proteomic architecture underlying the role of ADNF-9 against ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic days 7-13 (E7-E13) to a 25% ethanol-derived calorie [25% EDC, Alcohol (ALC)] diet, a 25% EDC diet simultaneously administered i.p. ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9), or a pair-fed (PF) liquid diet. At E13, fetal brains were collected from 5 dams from each group, weighed, and frozen for LC-MS/MS procedure. Other fetal brains were fixed for TUNEL staining. Administration of ADNF-9 prevented alcohol-induced reduction in fetal brain weight and alcohol-induced increases in cell death. Moreover, individual fetal brains were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Statistical differences in the amounts of proteins between the ALC and ALC/ADNF-9 groups resulted in a distinct data-clustering. Significant upregulation of several important proteins involved in brain development were found in the ALC/ADNF-9 group as compared to the ALC group. These findings provide information on potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 in the fetal alcohol exposure model.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the association of prenatal alcohol exposure with balance in10-year-old children. Design: Population-based prospective longitudinal study. Setting: Former Avon region of UK (Southwest England). Participants: 6915 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children who had a balance assessment at age 10 and had data on maternal alcohol consumption. Outcome measures: 3 composite balance scores: dynamic balance (beam-walking), static balance eyes open, static balance eyes closed (heel-to-toe balance on a beam and standing on one leg, eyes open or closed). Results: Most mothers (95.5%) consumed no-to-moderate amounts (3-7 glasses/week) of alcohol during pregnancy. Higher total-alcohol consumption was associated with maternal-social advantage, whereas binge drinking (>4 units/day) and abstinence were associated with maternal social disadvantage. No evidence was found of an adverse effect of maternal-alcohol consumption on childhood balance. Higher maternal-alcohol use during pregnancy was generally associated with better offspring outcomes, with some specific effects appearing strong (static balance eyes open and moderate total alcohol exposure at 18 weeks, adjusted OR 1.23 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.49); static balance eyes closed and moderate total alcohol exposure at 18 weeks, adjusted OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.48). Similar results were found for both paternal and postnatal maternal alcohol exposure. A Mendelian-randomization approach was used to estimate the association between maternal genotype and offspring balance using the non-synonymous variant rs1229984*A (ADH1B) to proxy for lower maternal alcohol consumption; no strong associations were found between this genotype/proxy and offspring balance. Conclusions: No evidence was found to indicate that moderate maternal alcohol consumption in this population sample had an adverse effect on offspring balance at age 10. An apparent beneficial effect of higher total maternal alcohol consumption on offspring balance appeared likely to reflect residual confounding.

N2  - Although children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure may exhibit the distinctive facial dysmorphology seen in full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), many lack that dysmorphology. This study examined the functional organization of working memory in the brain in three groups of children-those meeting diagnostic criteria for FAS or PFAS, heavily exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children, and healthy controls. A verbal n-back task (1-back and 0-back) was administered to 47 children (17 with FAS/PFAS, 13 HE, and 17 controls) during fMRI. Intra-group one-sample t-tests were used to identify activity regions of interest central to verbal working memory including the dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC), inferior frontal gyrus, caudate/putamen, parietal cortex, and cerebellar Crus I/lobule VI and lobule VIIB-IX. Whereas groups did not differ in task sensitivity, fMRI analyses suggested different patterns of sub-network recruitment across groups. Controls primarily recruited left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). By contrast, HE primarily recruited an extensive set of fronto-striatal regions, including left dPFC and left caudate, and the FAS/PFAS group relied primarily on two cerebellar subregions and parietal cortex. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate differential recruitment of critical brain regions that subserve basic function in children with different fetal alcohol spectrum disorders compared to controls. The distinct activation patterns seen in the two exposed groups may be related to substantial differences in alcohol dose/occasion to which these groups were exposed in utero.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - High numbers of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) have been described as having mental health problems. This article summarizes research about mental health problems in FASD and considers related developmental and environmental issues. A computer-based literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Academic Search Complete, and Education Resources Information Centre for articles addressing the prevalence and types of mental health issues in individuals affected by FASD. High rates of mental disorders within the FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) population were found to be consistently reported for both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Moreover, problems that emerge in childhood may reflect a convergence of genetic, environmental, and neurophysiological factors that persist into adulthood. Researchers are beginning to document the impacts of PAE on later mental health development. Further longitudinal study is needed to determine whether there is an increasing severity of mental health deficits and consequences with age, and whether any such changes reflect increasingly deteriorating environmental factors or brain-based factors. Additionally, research is needed to design interventions to better address the unique mental health needs of this population.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affects central nervous system development, growth, and morphology at higher exposure levels. Little is known about the effects of PAE at lower exposure levels or in young adults. Research on children with higher levels of PAE has shown that PAE predicts behavior problems. The question remains whether these effects are permanent or ameliorated by maturation into adulthood. Methods: These data are from a longitudinal study of PAE. Mothers were recruited from a prenatal clinic and interviewed during their fourth prenatal month, seventh month, and delivery. In the postpartum, mothers and offspring were seen at 8 and 18 months, and 3, 6, 10, 14, 16, and 22 years. Results: At 22 years, PAE significantly predicted behavior as measured with the adult self-report. These findings were significant controlling for covariates. Exposure at each trimester predicted increased behavior problems on the Total Score, Internalizing, Externalizing, Attention, and Critical Items scales. Use across pregnancy predicted a higher rate of behavior problems compared to no use and use in the first trimester only. Conclusions: The effects were dose-response and significant at each trimester of pregnancy. However, duration across pregnancy was a better predictor than drinking during the first trimester only. Binge drinking was not a better predictor of outcome compared to average daily volume (ADV), and within categories of ADV, binge drinking did not predict more problems than nonbinge drinking. Thus, there is no safe level or safe time during pregnancy for women to drink. These data demonstrate that the effects of PAE, even at low to moderate levels, extend into young adulthood and are most likely permanent. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Craniofacial bone dysmorphology is an important but under-explored potential diagnostic feature of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. This study used longitudinal MicroCT 3D imaging to examine the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on craniofacial bone growth in a mouse model. C57BL/6J dams were divided into 3 groups: alcohol 4.2% v/v in PMI liquid diet (ALC), 2 weeks prior to and during pregnancy from embryonic (E) days 7-E16; pair-fed controls (PF), isocalorically matched to the ALC group; chow controls (CHOW), given ad libitum chow and water. The MicroCT scans were performed on pups on postnatal days 7 (P7) and P21. The volumes of the neurocranium (volume encased by the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones) and the viscerocranium (volume encased by the mandible and nasal bone), along with total skull bone volume, head size, and head circumference were evaluated using general linear models and discriminant analyses. The pups in the alcohol-treated group, when compared to the chow-fed controls (ALC vs CHOW) and the isocaloric-fed controls (ALC vs PF), showed differences in head size and circumference at P7 and P21, the total skull volume and parietal bone volume at P7, and volume of all the tested bones except nasal at P21. There was a growth trend of ALC<CHOW and ALC
CHOW), and the total skull, parietal bone, and occipital bone at P21 (ALC<CHOW, ALC<PF). While covarying for the P7 measures, the treatment affected only the 3 neurocranial bones at P21 (ALC<CHOW, ALC<PF). Discriminant analysis sensitively selected between ALC and CHOW (AUC=0.967), between ALC and PF (AUC=0.995), and between PF and CHOW (AUC=0.805). These results supported our hypothesis that craniofacial bones might be a reliable and sensitive indicator for the diagnosis of prenatal alcohol exposure. Significantly, we found that the neurocranium (upper skull) was more sensitive to alcohol than the viscerocranium (face). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: During late prenatal and early postnatal life, the reproductive system in males undergoes an extensive series of physiological and morphological changes. Prenatal ethanol (EtOH) exposure has marked effects on the development of the reproductive system, with long-term effects on function in adulthood. The present study tested the hypothesis that prenatal EtOH exposure will delay the onset of spermatogenesis. Methods: Development of the seminiferous tubules and the onset of spermatogenesis were examined utilizing a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Male offspring from ad libitum-fed control (C), pair-fed (PF), and EtOH-fed (prenatal alcohol exposure [PAE]) dams were terminated on postnatal (PN) days 5, 15, 18, 20, 25, 35, 45, and 55, to investigate morphological changes through morphometric analysis of the testes from early neonatal life through young adulthood. Results: PAE males had lower relative (adjusted for body weight) testis weights compared with PF and/or C males from PN15 through puberty (PN45). In addition, fewer gonocytes (primordial germ cells) were located on the basal lamina on PN5, while more of those touching the basal lamina were dividing in PAE compared with PF and C males, suggesting delayed cell division and migration processes. As well, the percentage of tubules with open lumena was lower in PAE compared with PF and C males on PN18 and 20, and PAE males had fewer primary spermatocytes per tubule on PN18 and round spermatids per tubule on PN25 compared with C males. Finally, the percentage of tubules at stages VII and VIII, when mature spermatids move to the apex of the epithelium and are released, was lower in PAE compared with PF and/or C males in young adulthood (PN55). Conclusions: Maternal EtOH consumption appears to delay both reproductive development and the onset of spermatogenesis in male offspring, with effects persisting at least until young adulthood. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Motivational interviewing + feedback intervention to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk among college binge drinkers: determinants and patterns of response
A1  - Ceperich S.D.
A1  - Ingersoll K.S.
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Many college women are at risk for pregnancy, and binge drinking college women are often at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Brief interventions with sustainable outcomes are needed, particularly for college women who are binge drinking, at risk for pregnancy, and at increased risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Two-hundred-twenty-eight women at a Mid-Atlantic urban university at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy enrolled in the randomized clinical trial, and 207 completed the 4 month follow-up. The BALANCE intervention used Motivational Interviewing plus feedback to target drinking and contraception behaviors. Main outcome measures included (1) the rate of risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy, (2) the rate of risk drinking, and (3) the rate of pregnancy risk. At 4-month follow-up, the rate of alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk was significantly lower in the intervention (20.2%) than the control condition (34.9%), (P < .02). Assignment to the intervention condition halved the odds of women remaining at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy, while not receiving the intervention doubled the odds of continued alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.16-4.09). A baseline history of blackouts, continued high blood alcohol drinking days at 1 month, and continued risk for pregnancy at 1 month independently contributed to a multivariate model of continued alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk at 4 month follow-up. BALANCE reduced alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk, with similar outcomes to longer interventions. Because early response predicted sustained alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk reduction, those who fail to achieve initial change could be identified for further intervention. The BALANCE intervention could be adopted into existing student health or university alcohol programs. The risks of unintended pregnancy and alcohol-exposed pregnancy among binge drinking women in college merit greater prevention efforts.

N2  - We explored differences in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors across six groups of professionals in key position to provide primary and secondary prevention efforts (physicians, educators, correctional staff, social workers, public health nurses, and substance abuse counselors). Achieving a 60.1% response rate, 2,292 professionals returned surveys, providing data on basic knowledge of FAS, FASD-associated risks and cognitive deficits, and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women. Across groups, findings revealed ample FASD knowledge and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women that increases as consumption becomes more frequent and severe. However, results revealed significant between-group differences data that provide valuable guidance for targeted future FASD education efforts. Public health initiatives regarding FASD have been effective in increasing knowledge among a broad range of professionals. However, between-group differences indicate the need for targeted, discipline-specific interventions. These differences highlight the need for all professional groups to provide a consistent public health message regarding maternal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Jones et al in 1973 described the prenatal alcohol exposure and the correlation with facial malformations, growth restriction, cognitive and behavioral problems as the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). But the first time that the correlation of the pregnant woman with alcohol consumption and the bad infant outcome referred was by Aristotles 2.350 years ago. Alcohol consumption had increased in the contemporary world. In USA 7.6% of the pregnant women drink alcohol during pregnancy. In Europe the problem is worst, especially in northern countries that 1% pregnant women are heavy addicted with alcohol. 25-50% of the women who drink alcohol continued alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In our country, in a very recent study, Karavitakis and al found that 20% of the Cretan pregnant women consume alcohol. The 13% had mild consumption (1 standard drink, 1 time/week). The women who drink alcohol in this study were the most educated, with the higher income and older age. From the above it is obvious that FAS is not uncommon and May et al considered an incidence of 0.2-2 per 1000 live births. In order to describe the large range of adverse outcomes, they proposed the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Stratton et al in 1996 defined the 5 diagnostic categories of FASD. These are, FAS with confirmed or not alcohol exposure, partial FAS with confirmed alcohol exposure, alcohol related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). The accurate history of prenatal exposure to alcohol is the main and crucial issue for the diagnosis of the FASD, but this is not always possible. The existing biomarkers as the levels of fatty acid ethyl esters in meconium and hair are difficult to be utilized in the clinical practice. The most common phenotype at birth includes low centile of OFC and BW and withdrawal symptoms. During infancy and early childhood, facial deformities (thin upper lip, short palpebral fissures, disappearance of lip philtrum, epicanthic folds, clinodactyly, nail hypoplasia), microcefaly, growth failure, intellectual disability, behavior problems and speech difficulties, were presented. Chromosomal imbalances may have similar to FASD phenotypes. So it is important the role of clinical geneticist in these cases. Fanconi anaemia, Smith-Lemi-Opitz syndrome, Stickler syndrome, Kabuki syndrome, Turner syndrome, has features which overlap with FASD. Chromosomal microarray analysis is useful to identify alternative diagnosis with similar phenotype as 22q11 deletions, which occurs of around 1 in 8000. Alcohol can damage a fetus at any stage of pregnancy. Damage can occur in the earlier weeks of pregnancy even before a woman knows that she is pregnant, and that time the fetus is particularly susceptible to alcohol exposure due to organogenesis,. Conclusions: No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered as safe during pregnancy. Even low amounts of alcohol during early pregnancy increases, the risk of spontaneous abortion substantially. For all these reasons a pregnant woman should not drink alcohol during pregnancy.

N2  - Consumption of 8 alcoholic drinks per week or 5 alcoholic drinks on one occasion by a pregnant woman can affect the developing fetus. However, it can be difficult to determine which patients are at risk. To evaluate how well the answer to a single question about binge drinking could help identify women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). Using data from a study of methods to prevent AEPs, the authors compared the efficacy of self-reported answers to a screening question about binge drinking (5 or more standard drinks on one occasion) within the past 90 days with answers to a question about drinking quantity (weekly consumption of 8 or more standard drinks) within the past 90 days. The participants were 354 women of childbearing age who met screening criteria for being at risk of an AEP. The binge question was answered positively by 346 women (97.7%) at risk, while only 209 women (59.0%) reported that they drank 8 or more drinks in a week. A single question about binge drinking can effectively and quickly identify the majority of women at risk of an AEP.

N2  - Ethanol consumption during pregnancy is a widespread problem which is increasing in the generation of young women. Gestational alcohol consumption causes fetal exposure to this teratogen and is associated with the onset of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FASD and FAS can lead to several physical, cognitive and behavioral disabilities, whose early diagnosis is of primary importance to perform primary prevention with total abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and secondary prevention in newborns and children for a proper follow up to reduce risk of secondary consequences. In recent years significant efforts have been made to understand the underlying mechanisms of this disease and to identify objective biological and instrumental diagnostic tools, such as exposure biomarkers in neonatal meconium and advanced magnetic resonance imaging. Nonetheless, further studies are still needed to implement our knowledge on fetal effects of ethanol, and multidisciplinary actions are necessary to raise awareness among women of childbearing age about the danger of consuming even small amounts of ethanol during pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - The study investigated prenatal alcohol consumption and knowledge of alcohol risks and fetal alcohol syndrome among Korean women. The participants were 221 Korean women who attended the post-partum care centers in Seoul, Korea. The data included the participants' background characteristics, quantity-frequency typology, Student Alcohol Questionnaire, and a scale on the participants' knowledge of fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol was consumed during pregnancy by 12.7% of the participants. Of these, 60.7% drank alcohol with their spouse. A few participants reported that nurses identified their drinking habits and gave them information on alcohol consumption and fetal alcohol syndrome. Most of the participants did not have the opportunity for prenatal counseling about fetal alcohol syndrome. The knowledge level regarding alcohol risks and fetal alcohol syndrome among the participants was poor. Alcohol consumption before pregnancy was significantly related to prenatal alcohol consumption. Prenatal alcohol consumption was not related to knowledge about alcohol consumption and fetal alcohol syndrome. The assessment of alcohol consumption and counseling about alcohol are needed for pregnant women in order to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

N2  - The highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome worldwide can be found in South Africa. Particularly in impoverished townships in the Western Cape, pregnant women live in environments where alcohol intake during pregnancy has become normalized and interpersonal violence (IPV) is reported at high rates. For the current study we sought to examine how pregnancy, for both men and women, is related to alcohol use behaviors and IPV. We surveyed 2,120 men and women attending drinking establishments in a township located in the Western Cape of South Africa. Among women 13.3% reported being pregnant, and among men 12.0% reported their partner pregnant. For pregnant women, 61% reported attending the bar that evening to drink alcohol and 26% reported both alcohol use and currently experiencing IPV. Daily or almost daily binge drinking was reported twice as often among pregnant women than non-pregnant women (8.4% vs. 4.2%). Men with pregnant partners reported the highest rates of hitting sex partners, forcing a partner to have sex, and being forced to have sex. High rates of alcohol frequency, consumption, binge drinking, consumption and binge drinking were reported across the entire sample. In general, experiencing and perpetrating IPV were associated with alcohol use among all participants except for men with pregnant partners. Alcohol use among pregnant women attending shebeens is alarmingly high. Moreover, alcohol use appears to be an important factor in understanding the relationship between IPV and pregnancy. Intensive, targeted, and effective interventions for both men and women are urgently needed to address high rates of drinking alcohol among pregnant women who attend drinking establishments.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can alter physical and behavioral development, leading to a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Despite warning labels, pregnant women continue to drink alcohol, creating a need to identify effective interventions to reduce the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects. Choline is an essential nutrient that influences brain and behavioral development. Recent studies indicate that choline supplementation can reduce the teratogenic effects of developmental alcohol exposure. The present study examined whether choline supplementation during prenatal ethanol treatment could mitigate the adverse effects of ethanol on behavioral development. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated with 6 g/kg/day ethanol in a binge-like manner from gestational days 5-20; pair-fed and ad libitum chow controls were included. During treatment, subjects from each group were intubated with either 250 mg/kg/day choline chloride or vehicle. Spontaneous alternation, parallel bar motor coordination, Morris water maze, and spatial working memory were assessed in male and female offspring. Subjects prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibited delayed development of spontaneous alternation behavior and deficits on the working memory version of the Morris water maze during adulthood, effects that were mitigated with prenatal choline supplementation. Neither alcohol nor choline influenced performance on the motor coordination task. These data indicate that choline supplementation during prenatal alcohol exposure may reduce the severity of fetal alcohol effects, particularly on alterations in tasks that require behavioral flexibility. These findings have important implications for children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Conflicting findings exist regarding the risks of low to moderate levels of alcohol use during pregnancy. A recent study from Australia has suggested that mild gestational drinking is not associated with adverse fetal effects, and may even be associated with favorable outcomes as compared to "no drinking".The study may lead women to continue consuming alcohol throughout pregnancy, despite methodological limitations that render its conclusions uncertain. This review discusses the challenges of assessing long-term effects of moderate drinking during pregnancy. Recommendations are provided for researchers investigating the effects of prenatal alcohol consumption on subsequent developmental outcomes in children.

A1  - Evrard S.G.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - In Argentina, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is an almost neglected condition as an important etiological factor for the induction of a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases that may appear during childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Children born to alcoholic mothers may show a spectrum of diseases ranging from an apparent normality to a profound mental retardation, passing through epilepsy, attention deficit disorders with or without hyperactivity, autism and pervasive developmental disorders, and different types of learning disorders. When adolescents, they may develop different kinds of personality disorders and substance abuse disorders. Finally, in adulthood, they may suffer from different types of affective and psychotic disorders, among others. A great number of those children may not develop their full mental and social potentiality as free individuals. They usually have diverse types of cognitive, attentional, mnemonic and affective impairments. Not infrequently, they engage in antisocial behaviors, have school or work troubles. In this work, I review the present clinical classifications of the disorders emerging from a PAE and the several neuropsychiatric diseases that can be induced by them, in order to call attention to the Argentinian neuropsychiatric community about the increasingly, although underdiagnosed, frequency of these disorders in our country.

N2  - Alcohol exposure in pregnancy is a common and modifiable risk factor for poor pregnancy and child outcomes. Alcohol exposure in pregnancy can cause a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems in the child including the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). In order to improve prevention strategies, we sought to describe the knowledge and attitudes of women of childbearing age regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus. We conducted a national cross-sectional survey via computer assisted telephone interview of 1103 Australian women aged 18 to 45 years. Participants were randomly selected from the Electronic White Pages. Pregnant women were not eligible to participate. Quotas were set for age groups and a minimum of 100 participants per state to ensure a national sample reflecting the population. The questionnaire was based on a Health Canada survey with additional questions constructed by the investigators. Descriptive statistics were calculated and logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations with participants' knowledge and attitudes. Of women surveyed, 61.5% had heard about effects of alcohol on the fetus and 55.3% had heard of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Although 92.7% agreed alcohol can affect the unborn child, 16.2% did not agree that the disabilities could be lifelong. Most women agreed that pregnant women should not drink alcohol (80.2%) and 79.2% reported having negative feelings towards pregnant women drinking alcohol. Women with higher education levels were more likely to know the effects of alcohol consumption in pregnancy (adjusted OR 5.62; 95% CI 3.20 to 9.87) but education level and knowledge were not associated with attitude. There was a disjunction between knowledge and attitudes towards alcohol consumption in pregnancy. These findings will assist in developing effective health promotion campaigns to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and subsequent fetal damage.

N2  - Psychological distress (PD) includes symptoms of depression and anxiety and is associated with considerable emotional suffering, social dysfunction and, often, with problematic alcohol use. The rate of current PD among American Indian women is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of U.S. women in general. Our study aims to fill the current knowledge gap about the prevalence and characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems among American Indian mothers whose children were referred to screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data was conducted from maternal interviews of referred American Indian mothers (n = 152) and a comparison group of mothers (n = 33) from the same Plains culture tribes who participated in an NIAAA-funded epidemiology study of FASD. Referred women were from one of six Plains Indian reservation communities and one urban area who bore children suspected of having an FASD. A 6-item PD scale (PD-6, Cronbach's alpha = .86) was constructed with a summed score range of 0-12 and a cut-point of 7 indicating serious PD. Multiple statistical tests were used to examine the characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems. Referred and comparison mothers had an average age of 31.3 years but differed (respectively) on: education (<high school: 47.4%, 9.1%), PD-6 mean scores (3.57, 1.48), current prevalence of serious PD (19.1%, 0.0%), and a current drinking problem (31.6%, 12.1%). Among referred mothers, those with a current drinking problem had a significantly higher mean PD-6 score. Having PD, serious PD, and 2 specific scale items significantly increased the odds that a referred mother would have a current drinking problem. Psychological distress among referred mothers is significantly associated with having a self-reported drinking problem. FASD prevention requires multi-level prevention efforts that provide real opportunities for educational attainment and screening and monitoring of PD and alcohol use during the childbearing years. Mixed methods studies are needed to illuminate the social and cultural determinants at the base of the experience of PD and to identify the strengths and protective factors of unaffected peers who reside within the same communities.

N2  - In the last 40 years a vast mass of clinical, epidemiological and experimental evidence has demonstrated that alcohol is a teratogenic agent and that its consumption during gestation can cause foetal death, malformations and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in the exposed fetus. The most dramatic presentation is the complete foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is observed in children born from heavy alcohol consuming mothers. FAS and of other fetal alcohol-related effects was reported in both USA and Europe in the middle 80 s. However, despite these evidences, many European countries have largely forgotten or minimize the risks associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. Thirty years later, new epidemiological and clinical studies as well as new biomarkers of fetal-alcohol damage have identified high risk populations and have provided data demonstrating that significant number of women in the EU drink during pregnancy. In September of 2009, a conference on 'ALCOHOL AND PREGNANCY' was organized sponsored by the Swedish Presidency of the European Union, to discuss political interventions in the EU concerning this question. I briefly summarize here the discussions, presentations and the prevention programs of some European countries. The main conclusion of the conference was that we need more information and prevention programs to improve prevention of the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption during gestation.

N2  - Maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy impairs neurodevelopment in offspring. Utilizing a rodent model of continuous moderate dose alcohol exposure throughout gestation [gestation day 1 (GD1)-GD22; BAC ~70. mg/dL], the impact of developmental alcohol exposure on juvenile cerebral cortex protein abundances was determined. At weaning, cerebral cortex tissue was collected from pups for 2D SDS-PAGE based proteome analysis with statistical analysis by Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Gestational alcohol exposure increased the abundance of post-translationally modified forms of cytoskeletal proteins and the abundance of proteins within the small molecule biochemistry (includes glucose metabolism) pathway and proteosome processing pathways though ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and chaperones were decreased in abundance. In weanling offspring exposed prenatally to alcohol, alterations in cytoskeletal protein post-translational modifications were noted. Increased abundance of proteins from the small molecule biochemistry pathway, which includes glucose metabolism, and proteosome processing pathways were also noted. Decreased abundances of ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and chaperone protein were noted in the cerebral cortex of these offspring. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: A battery of clinical assessments was used in the Lililwan* Project, Australia's first population-based Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) prevalence study, conducted in the remote Fitzroy Valley, Western Australia. One objective was to develop and assess test-retest reliability of an acceptable questionnaire for collecting health information in remote Aboriginal communities feasible for use in the Lililwan Project.Methods: A questionnaire was developed by paediatricians to assist in diagnosis of FASD. Content was based on a literature review of FASD diagnostic criteria, existing questionnaires and risk factors for FASD and birth defects. Aboriginal community members, including qualified Aboriginal language interpreters, adapted the questionnaire to ensure language and cultural components were appropriate for use in the Fitzroy Valley. Locally developed pictorial aids were used for gathering accurate information on alcohol use. Aboriginal 'community navigators' assisted researchers to translate the questions into Kimberley Kriol or local Aboriginal languages depending on participant preference.A subset of 14 questions was assessed for test-retest reliability in 30 parents/carers of children in the Lililwan Project cohort, who were interviewed by one rater using the entire questionnaire, then by a second rater who repeated 14 critical questions at least 6 hours later.Results: The full questionnaire contained 112 items and took 50 minutes to administer. For a subset of 14 items from the full questionnaire percent exact agreement between raters ranged from 59-100%, and was below 70% for only 1 question. Test-retest reliability was excellent (Kappa 0.81-1.00) for 5 items, substantial (Kappa 0.61-0.80) for 5 items, and moderate, fair or slight (Kappa <0.60) for the remaining 4 items tested. Test-retest reliability for questions relating to alcohol use in pregnancy was excellent. When questions had moderate, fair or slight agreement, information was obtained from alternate sources e.g. medical records. Qualitative feedback from parents/carers confirmed acceptability of the questionnaire.Conclusions: This questionnaire had acceptable test-retest reliability and could be used to collect demographic, socio-cultural and biomedical information relevant to the diagnosis of FASD in Aboriginal communities throughout Australia and elsewhere. Community input is crucial when developing and administering questionnaires for use in cross-cultural contexts.*Lililwan is a Kimberley Kriol word meaning 'all the little ones'.

N2  - Background: Accurate confirmation of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is required as a diagnostic criterion for the majority of children adversely affected by PAE who do not manifest the physical features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. A number of ethanol biomarkers have been used to assess PAE, often with suboptimal results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and cost of PAE screening in newborns by measuring phosphatidylethanol (PEth) in dried blood spot (DBS) cards. Methods: The feasibility of collecting an additional DBS card during routine newborn screening and the background prevalence of PAE were evaluated in a de-identified sample of newborn children delivered at the University of New Mexico Hospital. Electronic orders to collect DBS cards from newborns who continue to bleed after the routine newborn screen, glucose, or hematocrit testing were initiated for all infants delivered during a 4-week time frame. Specimens were sent to a contract laboratory for PEth analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A cost analysis was conducted to compare the cost of PAE screening by PEth in DBS versus PEth in conventional blood specimens and by meconium fatty acid ethyl esters. Results: From 230 collected cards, 201 (87.4%) had at least 1 full blood spot (amount sufficient for PEth analysis), and 6.5% had PEth >20 ng/ml indicative of potential PAE in late pregnancy. PAE screening by PEth in DBS is logistically simpler and less expensive compared with 2 other screening approaches. Conclusions: These results indicate that screening for PAE in DBS cards is a feasible procedure and that a majority of infants have enough blood after the routine heel prick to fill an additional card. Moreover, screening by PEth analysis from DBS cards is cost-efficient. The acceptability of such screening by parents and corresponding ethical issues remain to be investigated. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain development are well documented in infants, children, and adolescents, but the long-term effects into adulthood are poorly understood. We present here the neuropathologic findings in a 34-year-old woman with an early childhood diagnosis of FAS. In addition to the characteristic FAS facial dysmorphia and cognitive impairments, the patient's course was notable for multiple psychiatric manifestations, with co-morbid diagnoses of schizophrenia (with auditory hallucinations), depression, and anxiety. The patient died of an acute pulmonary embolism. At autopsy, the brain was mildly underweight (1150 grams). The cerebral hemispheres demonstrated a simplified gyral pattern and mild underdevelopment of the lateral temporal lobes with striking bilateral clefts between the superior and middle temporal gyri. Histologically, there was an apparent paucity of neurons (both granular and pyramidal) in the temporal cortex, and mild asymmetric hippocampal rotation. The corpus callosum, subcortical nuclei, cerebellum, and brainstem were unremarkable. The ventricles were not enlarged. There were no acquired changes, e.g., infarcts. Moreover, neuronal loss and/or gliosis were not detected in the gray matter structures, and there was no evidence of destructive lesions in the white matter. The analysis of this case provides the unique opportunity to determine the phenotype of the human brain that was exposed to prenatal alcohol more than three decades before death and in which secondary diseases, e.g., atherosclerosis with infarcts, were not present to obscure the phenotype. The primary process appears to be static and malformative without evidence of secondary degenerative lesions, e.g., neuronal loss, over time. While clefts of the temporal lobe have not been reported in FAS, excessive cortical thickness of the lateral temporal gyri and asymmetry of the hippocampi have been described. The relationship of these lesions involving the limbic system to comorbid psychiatric disease in older individuals with FAS is unknown.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to behavioral and cognitive impairments across multiple domains. Many of the brain regions impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure are also linked with olfactory processing, and odor identification deficits have been documented in certain neurological disorders associated with these brain regions. As odor identification following prenatal alcohol exposure is not well studied, we compared odor identification in children with prenatal exposure to alcohol (AE) to typically developing controls (CON) (N = 16/group). It was hypothesized that children in the AE group would perform more poorly than children in the CON group on the San Diego Odor Identification Test, an identification test of 8 common household odorants. Children exposed to alcohol during prenatal development were significantly impaired in olfactory identification (M = 5.95, SE = 0.37) compared to typically developing controls (M = 7.24, SE = 0.37). These findings confirmed the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with odor identification deficits, and suggest that further research is warranted to identify the mechanisms underlying these deficits, the integrity of brain areas that are involved, and to determine whether olfactory performance might contribute to better identification of children at risk for behavioral and cognitive deficits. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are conditions caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in amounts sufficient to cause permanent deficits in brain functioning. Extent of damage largely depends on timing, dose, frequency, and pattern of exposure. Timing is especially important because prenatal alcohol exposure during critical periods of gestation can affect brain development in ways that produce varying patterns of neurocognitive deficits and associated adaptive impairments. This article describes some of the more serious neurophysiological and neuropsychological sequelae of prenatal alcohol exposure that contribute to increased risk for substance abuse problems among people with an FASD. We discuss the unique interface between pharmacological treatment and FASD, noting that failure to consider the possibility of FASD in treatment planning may result in treatment failure and/or relapse. Finally, we present a clinical case example and recommend service accommodations to address some of the impairments in FASD that limit substance abuse treatment success.

N2  - Eorts to raise awareness of the risks associated with alcohol use during pregnancy have been underway for over thirty years but trends in alcohol use among women of reproductive age, both pregnant and nonpregnant women, remain steady. A key behavior change strategy traditionally involves creation and dissemination of eective prevention messages aimed at reducing risky behaviors. Reasons for change (or lack of change) in lifestyle behaviors are complex and likelymulti-faceted. Some reasons why alcohol use among women of reproductive age remains steady might include: (1) current prevention messages are not reaching those for whom they are most relevant; (2) messages are not deemed credible; or (3) messages are competing with conflicting or inaccuratemessages from other sources such as the media, health care providers, and social networks. Formative research, conducted by CDC and RTI International, used a series of focus groups to gather information on what women know and believe about alcohol use in pregnancy. Twenty focus groups were conducted in two U.S. cities with women of reproductive age (18-35 years). Topics explored included knowledge and beliefs about the risks of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, perceptions of social influences, and trusted sources of health information related to alcohol use during pregnancy. Women acknowledged the risks and consequences of drinking alcohol during pregnancy, but many held misconceptions. Some women continued to drink during pregnancy and some expressed intent to continue drinking until pregnancy confirmation. Findings indicated that women's partners, families, and friends influence women's decisions to drink or abstain from alcohol. Also, health care providers and the Internet act as important sources of health information, but sometimes do not adequately educate about the risks of alcohol use and pregnancy. CDC worked with American Institutes for Research (AIR) to use the findings from these focus groups to developmessages and communication concepts for women of reproductive age with the goal of developing new educationalmaterials for a specific sub-group of this population - women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. These concepts andmessages were tested through eight additional focus groups in two U.S. cities. The findings of these latter focus groups were used to revise the messages and concepts and incorporate them into new CDC FASD communication materials.

N2  - Purpose: Interventions to reduce alcohol and tobacco-exposed pregnancies are needed in "real world" settings. CHOICES, a CDC-funded multisite RCT, tested a dual-focus behavioral intervention for prevention of alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) in 830 high risk women. Target behaviors were alcohol use and adoption of effective contraception. Settings included primary care clinics, university- hospital based obstetrical/gynecology practices, an urban jail, substance abuse treatment settings and a media-recruited sample. Intervention women significantly reduced their AEP risk relative to those receiving brief advice (69.1%vs. 54.3%) with approximately two-fold greater odds of being at reduced risk (OR=1.90). The intervention was then adapted for public health care settings, targeting an additional behavior (smoking) and integrated into primary care clinics in a large public hospital system. A subsequent RCT (CHOICES Plus) was conducted to determine feasibility, efficacy and cost effectiveness. This presentation will focus on screening and recruitment challenges in the CHOICES Plus study, barriers to implementing behavioral health interventions in public health care settings, and strategies for reconciliation of challenges. Methods: CHOICES Plus was integrated into 11 primary care clinics in a large public hospital system. Electronic medical records were used to facilitate screening, intervention and follow up. The intervention was two sessions with a behavioral health counselor, a contraception visit with a primary care provider, and a referral to a smoking cessation quit line or smoking cessation clinic. Eligible women were of childbearing age (18-44), presumed fertile, sexually active with aman, not using effective contraception, and drinking at risky levels. 10,367 women were screened, 429 (4.1%) were eligible and 252 enrolled (58.7%). Mean age was 31 years; 47.2%were Hispanic, 42.1%Black, 25.4%White, and 32.5%Other; 22.2%were married; 64.7%had at least a high school education; 37.3%were working; median household income was <20k; 46.4%were smokers. Participants drank an average of 28.7 drinks per week. Conclusion: Three of the eleven clinics emerged as top recruitment sites for eligible women. A number of challenges and solutions were identified, including ways to work within clinic flow, methods for maximizing efficient screening at multiple sites, and approaches for using both passive and active recruitment methods.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal exposures to perturbations in the species-typical intrauterine environment are associated with altered neurodevelopmental trajectories, such as learning disabilities and reactive temperament, both of which are related to poor emotion regulation, and via that form of psychopathology, addiction disorders. Associations have been identified between: prenatal maternal psychosocial distress and cognitive delays; maternal immune activation, an effector of distress, and altered CNS development such as decrements in sensory gating and decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus; glucose dysregulation and insults to memory development. While compelling, the human studies cannot adequately control for factors in the postnatal environment possibly correlated with those in the prenatal one as influencing these child outcomes. Study Purpose: We aim to identify developmentally meaningful effects of prenatal exposures at the time of influence in the human fetus. Methods: To assess fetal effects, the amount of fetal movement (FM) and of 'coupling' coincident occurrences in FMand heart rate increases are measured. Higher FM is associated with more reactive and active temperament in infants. Coupling indexes the integration of the CNS and somatic and ANS systems, and rises over the course of gestation; it predicts faster brain stem processing in the newborn. Participants also underwent: three ambulatory assessments of daily distress (reported for 24 hours, every 30 minutes, on a Palm Diary Assistant), two blood draws, two 20-minute periods monitoring fetal behavior (Toitu actocardiograph), and two National Cancer Institute 24-hour dietary recall surveys (ASA-24). Sugar intake was assessed as a percent of total daily calories. FMwas coded as a percent of total observation time. Results: In 89 pregnant adolescents (90.90% Latina, median age=18, sd=1.12) and their fetuses (61%male), higher maternal distress and IL-6were associatedwith a smaller change in coupling over gestation (F (2,86) = 3.77; p < .03). In a subsample of 36 dyads controlling for maternal weight and birth weight, a higher percentage of sugar calories predicted a greater percentage of FM (beta=0.46, p=0.02). These results suggest that the 'fetal origins of adult disease', including those related to neurobehavioral development and future disorders of addiction, can be identified prior to birth and postnatal influences.

N2  - The idea that exposure to environmental insults during pregnancy, such as alcohol,may alter fetal programming and aect adult disease susceptibility has gained wide acceptance. Fetal alcohol exposed ospring displaymany behavioral and physiological abnormalities including neuroendocrineimmune functions, which often carry over into their adult life. Since neuroendocrine-immune system is critically involved in the regulation of tumor surveillance, we determined whether prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) increases the ospring susceptible to tumorigenesis during adult life. First, we investigated whether PAE could enhance the development of mammary carcinoma using N-nitroso-Nmethylurea (NMU) as a carcinogen in adult ospring. We found that PAE female rats displayed an increase in mammary tumor incidence, growth and malignancy rate. PAE female rats also showed increase lung retention of mammary cancer cells and larger number and size of tumor foci.We also investigated PAE male's susceptibility to carcinogens during adulthood. The PAE adult males showed increased incidence of high prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia following NMU and testosterone treatments. Determination of immune status revealed that PAE rats had reduced numbers and functions of NK cells and macrophages. These changes in innate immune functions were correlated with a reduced activity of hypothalamic beta-endorphin neurons in PAE ospring. Supplementation of beta-endorphin neurons via transplantation or in vivo dierentiation increased the cytolytic function of NK cells and macrophage activity and decreased the incidence of mammary cancer in female and prostates cancer in male PAE rats. These data suggest that alcohol exposure in utero increases the susceptibility to tumorigenesis in endocrine tissues in adulthood and suggests that the neuroimmune system may play a role in the underlying mechanism.

N2  - One of the characteristic hallmarks of FASD is impairment in learning and memory processes. Experimentally we can study long-term potentiation (LTP), a biological model of learning and memory, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In this study we have observed deficits in LTP in adult male rats who have been exposed to alcohol prenatally, whereas females are spared. These deficits are accompanied by reductions in important neuronal antioxidants such as glutathione in both male and female ospring. Furthermore, we have determined that the deficit in LTP in alcohol-exposed animals may be a direct cause of glutathione depletion, as depleting glutathione in control males produces a similar deficit in LTP to that observed in alcohol exposed males, but glutathione depletion in control females does not aect LTP, mirroring the eects of prenatal ethanol exposure. Future studies are aimed at determining the interaction between glutathione and LTP. To mimic the FASD brain, a cohort of pregnant rats was administered ethanol in a liquid diet (35.5%ethanol derived calories) from Gestational Day 1 until day 21. In an attempt to ameliorate the deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, on Gestational Day 21 animals were switched to a diet supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids for the remainder of their lives.Omega-3 fatty acids are important for membrane fluidity, participate inmany signaling cascades in the brain and can increase antioxidant protection.We have found that supplementation can completely increase glutathione in the brain and reverse the deficits in LTP observed in male animals. These results indicate that omega-3 fatty acids may be an important addition to the diet of children suering from FASD and may be able to "rescue" the deficits in learning andmemory common with this disorder.

N2  - While it is known that suboptimal maternal Vitamin D status can be associated with a variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes, the frequency of low Vitamin D status inmany populations is a subject of debate. Furthermore, the correlation between Vitamin D status and maternal alcohol consumption to our knowledge has not been explored. As part of an ongoing longitudinal cohort study on FASD being conducted in Ukraine, women were recruited during pregnancy in two regions of Ukraine on the basis of self-report of alcohol consumed in the first half of pregnancy. Blood samples were collected at the time of enrollment in mid-trimester. Analyses for plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) concentrations were performed for women withmoderate to heavy levels of alcohol exposure, and for a comparison group of women who reported no or little alcohol exposure. Values were adjusted for solar radiation by month, pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational age at blood draw, smoking status, and maternal age and compared between groups using linear regression. Analyses were performed for 360 women, 180 exposed and 180 comparison women with samples drawn at a mean gestational age of 20.4 weeks, SD 7.0 weeks. Across both groups 50.6%and 32.9%were classified as Vitamin D deficient or insucient, respectively. Mean plasma 25(OH)D concentrations in the alcohol-exposed and unexposed groups were 20.6 ng/mL and 21.8 ng/mL, respectively. After adjustment for covariates, for each additional ounce of alcohol consumed per drinking day in the 2 weeks prior to the time of enrollment, there was a 2.4 ng/mL decrease in 25(OH)D concentrations (p= 0.03). These data suggest a very high prevalence of suboptimal Vitamin D status in pregnant Ukranian women overall, and a specific association between higher levels of alcohol consumption in pregnancy and lower levels of Vitamin D, potentially contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with alcohol.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is a significant cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Growing evidence shows that maternal nutrition is an importantmodifier of alcohol's damage. Iron is essential for fetal brain development and gestational iron deficiency (ID) is common.We recently showed that maternal ID synergizes with ethanol to reduce body growth, associative learning, and myelination in the ospring. Since micronutrient supplementation is being tested clinically for at-risk pregnancies, we investigated how ethanol aected fetal iron metabolism. Using a gestational rat model of binge alcohol exposure (5 g/kg/day, dpc13.5-19.5), we found that ethanol significantly altered fetal iron metabolism at dpc20.5. In iron-sucient dams, ethanol reduced fetal brain iron stores (decreased ferritin heavy chain, FeH) and suppressed compensatory increases in transferrin (Tf) and its receptor (TfR). At the same time, fetal liver sequestered iron (increased FeH, TfR) at the expense of fetal brain. Maternal ID magnified this dysfunction with further declines in brain iron stores (decreased FeH) and continued iron hoarding by liver (increased FeH, TfR). This disconnect occurred because ethanol significantly increased hepcidin synthesis by fetal liver, and thus erroneously signaled that fetal tissues were iron-sucient. Hepcidin is a master regulator of iron metabolism and is strongly responsive to inflammatory signals.We found that ethanol increased inflammatory signals within the fetus, and elevated TNFa and IL-1b synthesis by fetal liver and brain.We propose that these ethanol-mediated increases in hepcidin and inflammatory cytokines miscommunicate fetal iron status and dysregulate how fetal brain and liver correctly sense and adapt tomaternal iron status, at the expense of developing brain. This response is distinct fromethanol's action in adults and emphasizes the need to study ethanol-nutrient interactions within a gestational context. Importantly, iron supplements may not fully normalize fetal iron status in PAE.

N2  - Change talk has been identified as an important predictor of outcome in motivational interviewing (MI) interactions and the strategic evocation of change talk is central to the technical definition of MI. Conversely, sustain talk has been linked to poor outcome and evocation of sustain talk in activities such as a the decisional balance in now proscribed in MI practice. Evidence regarding the link between change and sustain talk and outcome is predominately corollary in nature, making it dicult to determine whether strategic evocation of change and sustain talk causally impacts treatment outcome. In the current study, we attempted to shed light on this dilemma by dierentiating between evoked and unevoked change talk. A subsample of 40 MI sessions was selected from a larger, multi-site trial which found an individual MI-based intervention to be eective at reducing risk for alcohol exposed pregnancy (Project CHOICES). All sessions were coded at the utterance level using a modified version of the Motivational Interviewing Sequential Code for Observing Processes (MISCOPE). Change and sustain talk were defined as evoked if the therapist utterance preceding them was a change or sustain talk oriented question or reflection. Change and sustain talk were further categorized as relating to alcohol, contraception, or another behavior. Results revealed that coders could reliably rate this novel construct. The mean number of evoked change talk utterances per session was less than unevoked for alcohol (M = 47.8, SD = 38.16 vs. 69.2, SD = 48.1), contraception (M = 25.0, SD = 22.7 vs. 39.9, SD = 27.5), and other behaviors (M = 8.4, SD = 10.1 vs. M = 23.1, SD = 23.5), but sucient frequency and variability for each were present to proceed with further analyses. A similar patter was noted for evoked versus unevoked sustain talk regarding alcohol (M = 12.6, SD = 11.5 vs. M = 34.5, SD = 27.5), contraception (M = 5.5, SD = 8.6 vs. M = 17.7, SD = 16.9), and other behaviors (M = 1.38, SD = 1.93 vs. M = 8.6, SD = 12.5). No type of change or sustain talk (evoked or unevoked) was related to contraception (number days unprotected sex) or drinking outcome (number risky drinking days) at a 3-month follow-up point.

N2  - One critical clinical challenge in the fetal alcohol research field is the need to develop more sensitive and reliable biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure that might also serve as predictors of functional brain damage in newborns, allowing for earlier identification of children at risk for longer-term adverse neurobehavioral consequences. Using genomic approaches, we reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy dierentially aects placental and fetal cortical gene expression, including genes coding for proteins associated with nervous, vascular and immune system development. Given the critical role of angiogenesis in both placental function and brain development, we have focused subsequent studies on the impact ofmoderate prenatal ethanol exposure on the expression of four placental proteins associated with angiogenesis. These proteins were measured in both placenta and fetal cortex along with an assessment of cerebral cortical microvascular development. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0%or 5%ethanol solution in 0.066%saccharin water for four hours each day throughout gestation. The mean daily ethanol consumption of 2.72 g/ kg, which produces a peak maternal serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL, did not aectmaternal weight gain, litter size, placental or fetal body weight. On GD20, rat placental:fetal units were removed by Caesarian section and both placenta and cerebral cortex were processed for western blotting analysis. In addition, fetal frontal cortices were evaluated for vascular density in the cortical plate (CP), intermediate zone (IZ), and ventricular zone (VZ) layers. Moderate drinking during pregnancy significantly decreased the expression of cerebral cavernous malformation protein 3 (CCM-3) and inhibin A in both placental and cerebral cortical tissues. In contrast, the levels of annexin A4 and neuropilin 2 were significantly increased in placenta, but not significantly dierent in cerebral cortex. Prenatal ethanol exposure decreased vascular density in all three layers of cerebral cortex. The reduction was statistically significant in the ventricular zone. These results provide preliminary evidence regarding the prospect of using a biosignature pattern of ethanol-induced alterations in placental proteins associated with angiogenesis as a biomarker for altered microvascular development, a process critical for normal brain development and function.

N2  - Alcohol (ethanol) drinking during pregnancy has become a major health and social concern. It has been linked to a wide range of birth-related defects and abnormal behaviors in ospring. In this study, we examined the eect of prenatal alcohol exposure on voluntary alcohol consumption and brain CB1 receptor using alcohol binge model that has been shown to produce a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The pregnant C57BL/6J mice were given alcohol (2.9 g/kg, two doses, 4 hrs apart, i.g.) on gestation days 7 and 8, while control mice received isocaloric maltose-dextrin solution. The results indicate increase in CB1 receptor expression in prefrontal cortex and alcohol consumption (10%v/v) in alcohol exposed adult ospring compared to control groups. Pharmacological antagonismof CB1 receptor function with either SR141716A or AM4113 (a dose of 3 mg/kg body wt. i.p.) significantly decreased alcohol consumption in alcohol exposed ospring. These results suggest that alcohol exposure during gestation day 7 and 8 dysregulates the function of eCB system and increases alcohol consumption in adult ospring. The eCB system might serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of some of the behavioral deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare the nutritional status ofmothers of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) with randomly-selected mothers of children without an FASD. One hundred and seventy-eight mothers (57 mothers of children with FASD and 121mothers with children without FASD) from a community in theWestern Cape Province of South Africa completed 24- hour dietary recall interviews. Data were analyzed with the Nutrition Data System for Research. Using a timeline, follow-back technique, each woman reported how current dietary intake compared to intake during her pregnancy with the index child. Dierence ofmeans tests compared the intake for macronutrients (total grams, fat, carbohydrate, protein, cholesterol, and fiber) andmicronutrients (vitamin A,D,E,K,C,B-complex, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, selenium, sodium, potassium, omega-3s, eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), docosapentanoic acid (DPA) and docshexanoic acid (DHA)) between the Dietary Recommended Intake (DRI) for pregnant women 19-30. Further analyses were made comparing subgroups.Mothers of children with an FASD, alcohol exposed controls, and unexposed controls. Statistical analysis indicated that: compared to DRI, with the exception of vitamin B12, selenium, and sodium, all mothers (FASD and control) were significantly deficient on all micronutrients (p < .000). While all mothers weremicronutrient deficient compared to DRI, mothers of children with FASD in this sample consumed, on average, higher amounts ofmicronutrients than mothers of randomlyselected controls. Analyses of specific micronutrient intake dierences betweenmothers of FASD and control children are ongoing at the time of the abstract preparation, but will be presented. Despite no statistical dierence in the total gram intake, mothers of randomly-selected controls had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) than mothers of children with FASD. These results support previous studies which indicate that people who consume large quantities of alcoholmay be at an additional nutritional disadvantage because chronic alcohol use can cause malabsorption or altered metabolism of nutrients. These results confirm the importance of BMI as one co-factor of risk for FASD, and suggest that nutritional status of the mother may have a direct or indirect eect on the fetus. And poor nutrition could be a co-factor that exacerbates the hallmark characteristics of FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) causes lifelong cognitive deficits found in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) by impairing brain development.We recently showed that dietary prevention of gestational maternal iron deficiency (ID) lessens FASD's learning deficits. Our preliminary data suggest this is due, in part, because alcohol inhibits the fetus from correctly interpreting maternal iron status, thus preventing the proper homeostatic adaptations between the ID fetal brain and liver. In adults, alcohol dysregulates iron homeostasis and suppresses the synthesis of hepcidin, the "master regulator" of iron homeostasis and a potent anti-inflammatory peptide. The consequences of hepcidin dysregulation during gestation to fetal development and its iron-sensing ability are unknown.We investigated this question using a 2nd trimester rat gestational PAEmodel (5 g/kg/d) under conditions of maternal iron suciency (IS) and ID.We evaluated gestational day 20.5 fetal brain, fetal liver, andmaternal liver using real-time PCR for the expression of hepcidin and pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa). Unexpectedly, rather than reducing hepcidin, as in adult alcoholics, PAE increased hepcidin production in both maternal and fetal liver, but not in fetal brain, during both IS and ID. PAE also increased IL-1b and TNFa expression under both IS and ID in fetal liver, brain, and maternal liver. These increases were additive in fetal brain and indicated a feed-forward inflammatory loop driven by alcohol. Additionally, in alcohol's absence, maternal ID increased both IL-1b and TNFa in these fetal andmaternal tissues, as compared with maternal IS. As a whole, our data suggest that PAE during maternal ID causes a more dramatic disruption of fetal iron metabolismand inflammation compared to maternal IS, magnifying the proinflammatory state produced by PAE. A firmer understanding of the impact ofmaternal iron status on PAE's inflammatory action may inform prophylactic and therapeutic dietary interventions withmaternal iron supplementation to reduce the FASD's outcome severity in children.

N2  - Disruption of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated as an important molecular mechanism underlying alcohol (ethanol)-induced birth defects. Recently, haploinsuciency in the Hedgehog receptor Cdon was shown to synergize with prenatal alcohol exposure to produce the facial and brain abnormalities associated with severe forms of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Employing a mousemodel of FAS, the study reported herein was conducted to examine whether single allelemutations in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh; the dominant vertebrate Hh ligand) or Gli2 (the dominant transcriptional activator of the Hh pathway) alter the severity of alcohol-induced facial dysmorphology. Timed-pregnancies were established by mating wildtype C57Bl/6J female mice with Shh+/- or Gli2+/- (backcrossed to C57Bl/6J) malemice. On gestational day (GD)7, timed pregnant dams were treated with two IP doses of 2.9 g/kg ethanol (or vehicle alone), administered four hrs apart. GD17 fetuses were then removed and genotyped. Following rigorous alignment, frontal and sagittal images of each specimen were captured, fromwhich nine unique craniofacial measurements were performed. Vehicle treated wildtype and heterozygous animals were largely indistinguishable. However, relative to their wildtype alcohol-exposed littermates, Shh+/- and Gli2+/- alcohol-exposed ospring exhibited an increase in severity of FAS-associated facial features, including midfacial hypoplasia and hypotelorism.While Shh+/- and Gli2+/- mice have been described as phenotypically normal, this study illustrates a functional haploinsuciency of both genes in combination with alcohol exposure. Additionally, these results further support Hh signaling perturbation as amechanism underlying the pathogenesis of FAS while highlighting the significance of gene-environment interactions for the teratogenic endpoint.

N2  - Because the majority of children adversely aected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) do not present with the physical features characteristic of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, confirmation of maternal drinking is required both for diagnosing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and initiating interventions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to play an important role in the mechanisms underlying the deleterious eects of PAE and are appealing as novel biomarkers since they are very stable in plasma and serum and have shown great promise as biomarkers of cancer and other conditions. In this study we used Exiqon wholemiRome PCR plates to examine the levels of 766 human miRNAs in serum samples from 34 pregnant women (17 Alcohol-users [AU] and 17 abstinent controls [AC]) selected from a well-characterized cohort at UNM. Patients were recruited from a clinic that serves pregnant women with current or past history of substance abuse.Women classified as AU reported >3 drinks/week and/or binge drinking episodes during pregnancy and were positive for at least one conventional ethanol biomarker, whereas controls abstained from alcohol use during pregnancy per self-report and were negative for all ethanol biomarkers. All serum samples were collected at mid-gestation. We found that the levels of 184 of the 341 miRNAs that were detected in serum were significantly altered in the AU group vs. controls (p < 0.05). To validate these findings, a subset of the 12most promising miRNAs due their fold change dierences between the groups was selected and analyzed by individualmiRNA PCR assays. We found that twomiRNAs (miR-200a andmiR-1908) emerged as candidatemiRNAs associated with AU. Furthermore, the ratio of miR- 1908/miR-200a was significantly higher in the AU group compared to controls (p < 0.002). Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, we found that the combination of these miRNAs resulted in an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.83 (p < 0.001) indicative of high sensitivity and specificity.When a novel direct ethanol metabolite (phosphatidylethanol [PEth], measured in a dry blood spot cards of a newborn) was added to the panel, diagnostic accuracy of the test improved further (AUC = 0.95; p = 0.001). In conclusion, our results suggest that alterations in the levels of two serum miRNAs could be used to reliably detect alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to numerous adverse eects on the developing fetus. Theses teratogenic outcomes are termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which in the most severe cases lead to fetal alcohol syndrome. There is a high prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and hearing disorders in the FASD population. Thus, alcohol exposure in utero is a potential factor for the etiology and mechanisms of PAE-related seizures. Evidence indicates that PAE alters auditory brainstemresponses in rodent, and the alterations persist into adulthood. The inferior colliculus (IC), the generator of auditory brainstem response wave V, plays a critical role in the initiation of tonic-clonic seizures following alcohol withdrawal. Thus, alcohol-induced changes in IC neuronal excitability may contribute to the mechanisms of PAE-related seizures.We have previously reported that PAE enhances the current density of high threshold voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels including CaV2.3 (R-type) channels, which exhibit biophysical properties closer to that of low threshold CaV (CaV3 T-type) channels. Here, we examined the eects of PAE on T-type channel currents in dissociated IC neurons obtained from ospring (P3-P7). Pregnant rats received a single dose of 5 g/kg body weight ethanol (95%) as a 30%(v/v) solution in Isomil by gastric intubation at gestational day 18. Control animals received only Isomil. Currents were recorded in the whole cell patch clamp configuration. T-type currents weremeasured using 5 mMCa2+ as charge carrier during voltage steps to - 40 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV. Quantification shows that T-type current density was significantly elevated in IC neurons of ospring subjected to PAE. Pharmacological experiments to dissect T-type currents are in progress. These findings suggest that in addition to high threshold CaV channels, PAE also alters the low threshold CaV channels, which may play important roles in the pathophysiology of PAE-related disorders of neuronal excitability.

IUGR models show dysfunctional uteroplacental vascular adaptations.We hypothesized that chronic binge alcohol results in uteroplacental vascular dysfunction by disrupting critical endothelial gestational adaptations. Methods: Maternal uterine vascular function was assessed utilizing wire myography following chronic binge alcohol administration in rats (peak blood alcohol concentration, 248 +/- 82.3 mg/dl, gestation day (GD) 7-17 or 19). Complementary proteomic approaches (2-D DIGE gel-based, iTRAQlabel-based, and label-free) and immunoblotting were used to delineate underlying mechanistic perspectives utilizing FAC sorted ovine uterine artery endothelial cells (GD 120-130; term = 147) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Results: Alcohol-induced uterine vascular dysfunction preceded fetal growth deficits (body weight, 21%, P = 0.002; placental weight, 22%, P = 0.001). No differences in uterine artery reactivity was noted in response to vasoconstrictors phenylephrine (P = 0.4) or thromboxane (P = 0.73), and to endothelium-independent dilator SNP (P = 0.65). Alcohol selectively impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation; acetylcholine significantly decreased vessel relaxation (dose and groupmain effect, P < 0.01; logEC50, -7.02 +/- 0.14 vs. -6.53 +/- 0.35; Emax, 14%). Complementary proteomic approaches showed that proteins associated with the key vasodilator nitric oxide (NO), and redox balances were affected (eg, HSP90b, P = 0.014; calmodulin, P < 0.001; thioredoxin, P = 0.017). Further, alcohol decreased levels of total endothelial NO synthase (eNOS, rate limiting enzyme for NOproduction) and excitatory P635eNOS/total eNOS (23%, P < 0.003) compared to the Controls and the related pERK/total ERK signaling (25.7%, P < 0.001). Discussion: (1) Chronic binge alcohol impairs endothelium-dependent uterine artery relaxation that is critical for gas and nutrient delivery to the fetus; 2) Uteroplacental vascular dysfunction precedes FASD growth deficits; 3) Alcohol negatively affects the chief uteroplacental vasodilator system (NO) and related signaling; 4) Rapid and high throughput quantitative proteomic platforms may be very helpful for FASD mechanistic insights, diagnosis, and to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies for FASD; 5) These findings suggest the involvement of the uteroplacental compartment in FASD pathogenesis.

N2  - Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that several of the long-term consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are the result of changes in the development and function of corticolimbic structures, including the hippocampal formation, that regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis.We sought to assess the impact of PAE on components of corticosteroid signaling pathways in the hippocampal formation. Methods: Throughout pregnancy, dams were offered either 10% (w/v) ethanol sweetened with 0.066% (w/v) saccharin (SAC) or 0.066% (w/v) SAC alone using a limited (4-h) access, drinking-inthe- dark paradigm. At postnatal day 40-50, the hippocampal formation was isolated and cytosolic and nuclear subcellular fractions were prepared. Using immunoblotting techniques, we assessed the effects of PAE on mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels in these fractions; additionally, we determined the effects of PAE on regulators of the subcellular localization of these receptors: 11-b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11b-HSD1) and FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51; FKBP5). Finally, we determined the effect of PAE on context discrimination, a hippocampal- dependent leaning/memory task. Results: PAE was associated with reduced MR and elevated GR nuclear localization in the hippocampal formation, while cytosolic levels of both receptors were not significantly altered. FKBP51 levels were reduced and 11b-HSD1 levels were increased in PAE mouse hippocampal formation. These alterations were associated with a reduced rate of context discrimination learning. Conclusions: The data support a model in which dysregulation of corticosteroid levels and corticosteroid receptor trafficking leads to nuclear accumulation of GR, and reduction ofMR, in the hippocampal formation of PAE mice. Persistence of these effects may convert hippocampal control of the HPA axis into a feed-forward system, and may underlie many of the effects of PAE on neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Massive apoptosis of neurons resulting from exposure of the developing brain to alcohol is considered as the main cause of long-lasting structural CNS abnormalities and neuronal cell death by activation of pro-apoptotic caspase 3. We established an in vivo rat FAS model by feeding of 16-day pregnant rats with a 6.7%ethanol liquid diet until delivery.We demonstrate that the levels of proapoptotic caspase 3 and Bax were increased in the brain of pups from the ethanol group, while the early expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl2-associated athanogene-3 (Bag3) was inhibited by ethanol exposure. Bag3 plays an important role in protein quality control and the clearance of misfolded proteins in the developing brain. The level of glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b) playing an essential role in neural development was increased in relation to the decreased Bag3 in the ethanol-treated groups. During the period of Bag3 inhibition, the level of a GSK3b downstreamtarget, b-catenin, was also increased in the brain of ethanol-exposed pups, suggesting its accumulation in cells and dysregulation of b-catenin signaling that can possibly induce developmental brain defects. In vivo studies demonstrated a negative correlation between prenatal ethanol uptake and the development of the brain. Body and brain weight were significantly lower at P5 and P8 in the ethanol groups as compared to control groups, coinciding with low Bag3 expression. Behavioral observations at postnatal days P8 and P15 revealed hearing and feeding diculties and eye blink deficits in the ethanol group when compared to controls.We also found dysregulation of synaptophysin and genes that control synaptogenesis. These genes were also altered in an in vitro human FAS model, where we used primary neuronal culture and utilized a relevant concentration of ethanol (50 mM) for 24 hours. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that biphasic Bag3 expression (low in developing brain and increases with aging) is strongly inhibited by ethanol exposure. These changes were accompanied by alterations in key signaling pathways in the brain including early postnatal expression and accumulation of apoptosis-related and developmentally regulated proteins, neuronal loss and developmental delays later in life.

N2  - This study is a collaboration between Motherisk and theMaternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC), which collected meconiumsamples throughout Canada to measure environmental chemicals, but not alcohol. The focus of our study is to investigate the incidence of heavy fetal alcohol exposure bymeconium FAEE analysis in Canada, as well as correlating neonatal outcomes and fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) concentrations. FAEEs serve as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. Meconium was collected from 1537 newborns at 11 obstetric units across Canada and participatingmothers also completed questionnaires that contained a section focusing on alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. The questionnaires will serve as a maternal self-report and will be compared to meconium FAEE concentration. Any meconiumsample with a total FAEE concentration (the sum of ethyl palmitate, oleate, stearate and linoleate concentrations) greater than 2 nmol/g meconium is classified as positive for excessive alcohol consumption during the second and/or third trimesters of pregnancy. Additionally, neonatal and maternal outcomes were recorded and will be correlated with total and individual FAEE concentrations to determine any associations. MeconiumFAEE analysis of the samples by GC-MS is currently ongoing at theMotherisk Laboratory. This study is the first National study on heavy fetal alcohol exposure anywhere in the world. Because an estimated 40%of heavily alcohol-exposed fetuses exhibit FASD, this approach will yield the most accurate estimate of the incidence of FASD in Canada.

N2  - Previously we reported that acute alcohol exposure reduces the availability of glutamine (GLN) and GLN related amino acids in thematernal and fetal compartments, and moderate doses of alcohol altermaternal and fetal hemodynamics. We hypothesized that third trimester-equivalent chronic prenatal alcohol exposure alters maternal-fetal hemodynamics, uterine and placental blood flow and fetal regional brain blood flow and that GLN supplementation attenuates the eects of alcohol. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to 4 groups: saline control, GLN control, alcohol (2.5 g/kg), or alcohol+GLN. Alcohol or saline infusions were given IV over 1 hour from gestation day (GD) 99 to 121, 3 consecutive days per week tomimic a weekend binge drinking pattern. A 100 mg/kg dose of GLN was administered IV as a 4.5%w/v aqueous bolus three times a day. OnGD116, catheters were placed in the maternal and fetal vasculature and a Doppler flow probe was placed around the maternal uterine artery. The experiment was conducted on GD121 using dierent labeled microspheres tomeasure regional blood flow before and after the treatment.We observed an overall decrease in basal uterine arterial blood flow rate on GD121 in the alcohol exposed groups at time 0 (before any treatment), but uterine artery blood flow rate was significantly increased at the end of 60 minutes after acute alcohol challenge on GD121 for the alcohol group (p = 0.023) compared to its baseline. Maternal and fetal MAP and HR for the alcohol group were also significantly elevated at 60 min (p < 0.05). The alcohol+GLN group also showed an increasing trend of maternal and fetal MAP and HR, but it was not statistically significant.We observed a decrease in basal fetal cerebellar and whole brain blood flow on GD121 before the start of final treatment in alcohol and alcohol+GLN groups compared to the saline control group (p < 0.05). On GD121 after final the treatment exposure, we observed an increase in fetal cerebellar (p < 0.05) and whole-brain blood flow in the alcohol and alcohol+GLN groups and a decrease in placental blood flow (p < 0.05) at the end of 60 minutes in the alcohol group compared to their respective baselines. These findings support the conclusion that prenatal alcohol exposure alters maternal and fetal vascular function and GLN has potential to mitigate these eects.

N2  - In children, prenatal alcohol exposure has been associated with fetal growth restriction that can persist into adolescence and low birth weight which can lead to altered development and programming, with lifelong consequences. Glutamine has been shown to diminish whole body proteolysis, increase protein synthesis and is used clinically as a nutrient supplement in low birth weight infants. We hypothesized that chronic third trimester-equivalent alcohol exposure reduces the bioavailability of amino acids in the maternal and fetal compartment and hampers fetal body growth, and that concurrent maternal L-glutamine supplementation with alcohol administration may improve the bioavailability of amino acids and mitigate alcohol?s negative developmental eects on fetal growth. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to 4 groups: saline control, glutamine (GLN) control, alcohol (2.5 g/ kg) or alcohol+GLN. Alcohol or saline infusions were given intravenously (IV) over 1 hour from gestation day (GD) 109 to 132 or fromGD 99 to 121, 3 consecutive days per week to mimic a weekend binge drinking pattern. 100 mg/kg of GLN dose was administered IV as a 4.5%w/v aqueous bolus three times a day. Animals were sacrificed on GD132, amniotic and allantoic samples were collected and fetal body growth parameters were measured. Prenatal alcohol exposure reduced fetal weight, height and increased ponderal index compared to the control group (p=0.06, <0.001 and 0.007 respectively). Fetal weight, height and ponderal index was showed and improving trend in the alcohol+ GLN group compared to the alcohol group (p=0.100, 0.005 and 0.082 respectively).We observed decreases in levels of aspartate and taurine in allantoic fluid and of arginine in amniotic fluid for the alcohol group (p<0.05). On GD121, we observed a decrease in basal levels of glutamine, arginine and tyrosine in fetal plasma in the alcohol group compared to the control and alcohol+GLN group. These results signify that third trimester-equivalent chronic prenatal alcohol exposure alters the bioavailability of amino acids, hampers fetal growth and maternal L-glutamine supplementation has potential to ameliorate fetal growth restriction caused by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - C57BL/6J (B6) mouse fetuses are susceptible to morphological malformations following prenatal ethanol exposure, while DBA/2J (D2) fetuses are resistant. Using recombinant inbred mice derived from a cross between B6 and D2 (BXD RIs), we previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) mediating several measures of teratogenesis, including a QTL for digit malformations on chromosome 16. Linkage mapping in an F2 population derived fromcrossing B6 and D2 verified this QTL. The interval is from82.5 to 87.3megabases and is relatively gene-poor, containing only 20 annotated genes (www.ensembl.org). Two intriguing candidate genes in this region are Adamts1 and Adamts5, which code for ADAMTS metalloproteases. These metalloproteases play a role in interdigital web regression during development;most of our digitmalformations likely result from improper interdigital web regression. Interrogation of the WebQTL and Mouse Genome Informatics databases showed that both genes are highly polymorphic in B6 and D2, with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in introns, 5' UTR and 3' UTR. Several additional SNPs lead to non-synonymousmutations in coding regions. In order to further characterize the role of Adamts1 and Adamts5, we dosed pregnant B6 and D2 dams withmaltose or ethanol on gestational day 9 and harvested several tissues 24, 72 or 96 hours later. In autopod/digit tissue from maltose-exposed fetuses, Adamts1 showed significantly higher expression in D2 compared to B6 at the 24 and 72 hour timepoints. Compared to maltose, ethanol exposed B6 fetuses showed a significant decrease in Adamts5 expression at the 24 and 72 hour timepoints, while D2 showed no changes. We are currently examining protein levels following in utero ethanol exposure using antibodies for ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS5. Preliminary data show a decrease in ADAMTS5 in autopod tissue extracted from B6 fetuses exposed to ethanol in utero. In order to examine enzymatic dierences between B6 and D2 for these 2 metalloproteases, we are assaying an antibody for cleaved versican, a proteoglycan that is cleaved by ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS5 during interdigital web regression.We have also obtained Adamts5 knockout mice and are crossing them with B6 and D2 to conduct a quantitative complementation test. These preliminary results suggest that Adamts1 and Adamts5 may play a role in susceptibility to digit malformations following prenatal alcohol, but future studies need to verify and further characterize the role.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) is one of the most prominent causes of mental retardation in the developed world, as heavy alcohol consumption can cause gross structural and physiological abnormalities in the central nervous systemresulting in deficits in learning and memory processes. Heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome, while moremoderate consumption of ethanol causes more subtle physiological changes. Underlying many of learning and memory deficits observed in FAE are alterations in gene expression, which when properly characterized will lead to a better understanding of the neurological abnormalities occurring following exposure to alcohol during development. One important regulator of gene expression is the RNA binding protein HuD, which binds to and stabilizes transcripts containing a HuD binding site. This protein is important during development for proper axonal outgrowth and targeting, as well as during learning andmemory processes. For these experiments, pregnant Long-Evans rats were given 5% saccharin- sweetened ethanol in a voluntary exposure paradigm.Once the pups reached adulthood, the animals were sacrificed and hippocampi harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was then extracted and HuD mRNA levels analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. HuD mRNA levels in hippocampi from rats exposed to ethanol in utero were significantly lower than saccharin exposed control animals. These results suggest that FAE could be limiting HuD expression, which could have a number of downstream eecs. Lower basal expression levels of HuD in FAE could be one factor contributing to deficits in learning andmemory processes. HuD stabilizes a number of transcripts involved in long-term potentiation, so learning and memory deficits in FAE could also be a results of abnormal synaptic plasticity. Decreased HuD expression could also lead to changes in the expression of HuD RNA targets involved in hippocampal dependent memory, leading to a cascade of changes in gene expression that would have a profound impact on neural function.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce persistent adverse developmental outcomes, collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Despite the substantial research characterizing the brain injury and resultant neurodevelopmental disabilities, a significant gap still exists in providing coordinated, timely and eective care and supportive policies for children with FASD. Furthermore, relatively little research has been conducted on interventions that provide eective services for these children. The purpose of this research was to perform a needs assessment that could be used to develop a customized, internet-based intervention that provides families aected by FASD with the appropriate strategies tomanage challenging behaviours and to facilitate positive interactions. Sixty caregivers and 26 clinicians from across Canada were interviewed by telephone. The questions were open-ended and designed to gain insight into the behavioural and emotional problems associated with FASD, eective and ineective parenting strategies, as well as the skills needed to manage challenging behaviours. Caregivers reported that themost challenging behaviour categories were Externalizing Behaviours (most common subcategories: 1st temper tantrums/anger; 2nd violence/ aggression; 3rd impulsivity), Cognitive Diculties (most common subcategories: 1st memory; 2nd language problems; 3rd attention problems) and Social Diculties/Maladjustment (most common subcategories: 1st issues with playing; 2nd inability to filter; 3rd annoys/aggravates others). The most successful parenting strategies were Parental Reflection, Routine/Structure/ Consistency and Environmental Modification, while the use of Aggression, Unrealistic Expectations and Consequences and Rewards were the least eective. When caregivers were asked the best way to deliver assistance, the top response was Internet followed by Support Groups. Clinicians reported that Issues with Professional Institutes and Behavioural Diculties/Challenges were the most common concerns they heard from caregivers of children with FASD; and the major limitations in accessing services and supports were Lack of Knowledge, Awareness and Training, Services and Supports are not accessible and Services and Supports Do not Exist. These data will inform the development of the intervention program Strongest Families: FASD, which will provide a family-centered approach to training, education and support for children with FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with increased sleep problems which may aggravate the neurobehavioural problems in children with FASD. Treatment of sleep problems in these children is a challenge, at least partly due to an incomplete understanding of the specific nature of the problems. We have completed a study to develop and evaluate 2 intervention programs (a motor-skill development and a neurofeedback program) for children with FASD. One of the objectives of this study was to assess the nature and occurrence of sleep disturbances in participating children. Methods: The caregivers of 43 children with FASD filled out a questionnaire developed to survey sleep disturbances. The questionnaire assessed the prevalence and frequency of sleep disturbances, as well as specific problems with going to bed or falling asleep, and waking up during the night. Caregivers were also asked to rate the quality of life of themselves and their child (on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being highest), and to rate what the quality would be if the sleep problems were solved. Information was also collected on the use of melatonin, which is commonly used to treat problems with falling asleep. Results: Twenty-nine out of 43 children (67%) were reported to have sleep disturbances. Most (27 of 29) had problems going to bed or falling asleep, with 10 children experiencing problems every night and 12 experiencing problems 3-6 times weekly. Twenty children had problems with waking in the night, with 3 experiencing problems every night, and 4 experiencing problems 3-6 nights weekly. Of 26 respondents, 16 caregivers reported that their child's quality of life would improve if the sleep problems were solved, while 14 reported that their own quality of life would improve. Average quality of life scores were lower for the children with sleep disturbances (7.1+/- 2.0) and their caregivers (6.7+/-1.8), compared to children without sleep disturbances (8.0+/-2.0) and their caregivers (7.6+/-1.6), but these differences were not significant (p=0.166 for children, p=0.107 for caregivers). Twenty-four children had used melatonin for sleep problems, with 19 currently using melatonin. Only 13 caregivers had sought help from the medical systemfor their children's sleep issues. Conclusions: A high proportion of children with FASD experience frequent sleep disturbances, which are perceived by over half of caregivers to affect the quality of life of themselves and their children.

N2  - Background: Rodent studies have demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation that has sex-specific effects on behavior across the lifespan. However there is limited research examining this relationship in humans. Pituitary volume has been suggested as a relatively stable and state-independent index of HPA axis activity, and volumetric changes in this region have been reported to predict internalizing symptoms in adolescents. We sought to determine if prenatal alcohol exposure producesmeasureable changes in pituitary volume and if so, whether they are associated with problem behavior. Methods: Forty-six adolescents with and without prenatal alcohol exposure, aged 12-18 years (M=14.9, SD=1.4), completed 3T T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and when available, their primary care givers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). For each subject, the volume of the pituitary was estimated by manually tracing the structure. Pituitary volumes were then adjusted for whole brain volume generated using FreeSurfer v5.1.0. Group differences in pituitary volume were analyzed using ANOVA, and Pearson's product moment correlations were utilized to determine the relationship between CBCLmeasures and adjusted pituitary volume. Results: Non-exposed control (CON) adolescents displayed sex differences in pituitary volume (female>male, p < 0.01) that were not observed in adolescents with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE). Inmale subjects, scores on the CBCL aggressive behavior scale were negatively associated with pituitary volume in AE (r = -0.75, p = 0.01), but not in the CON adolescents. No relationship between pituitary volume and CBCL-measured behavior was observed in females. Conclusion: Given the lack of a sex difference in pituitary volume in the AE group, prenatal alcohol exposure may interfere with adolescent typical sexual dimorphismof the pituitary. In alcoholexposed males, pituitary volume was related to aggressive behavior as reported on the CBCL, such that greater pituitary volume was associated with less caregiver reported aggressive behavior. Future studies should examine exposure- and sex-dependent differences in pituitary volume as it relates to pubertal development.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters the structure of specific brain regions, and these alterations correspond with a highly complex pattern of impairments in neurocognition, self-regulation, and adaptive functioning. However, very little is known about how PAE alters structural white matter connectivity among regions. Diusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a MRI technique that allows for the assessment of whitematter integrity by measuring restriction of water diusion known as fractional anisotropy (FA). Evidence from rodent models demonstrates that the development of myelination: 1) is reduced by PAE; and 2) begins earlier in females compared tomales. Similarly fromhuman studies, decreased integrity of several whitematter tracts were observed among individuals with a FASD compared to Controls. However, nothing is known about how the integrity of white matter tracts may dier between boys compared to girls with a FASD. In the current study, Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were utilized for analysis of DTI images in order to investigate tract integrity in FASD vs. Control boys and girls (ages 5 to 16 years). We hypothesized reduced integrity of whitematter tracts (lower FA) in FASD compared to Control participants, and that the eects of FASD on structural integrity will be sexually dimorphic. Independent t-tests were performed between each group and sex, and significance was determined by threshold-free clustering and a voxelwise significance of p<.05. Preliminary findings showed that youth with a FASD exhibit lower values of FA in frontal gyrus white matter. Interestingly, this eect was observed in opposite hemispheres between sexes, with reduced FA values occurring in the right hemisphere of FASD girls, but in the left hemisphere of FASD boys when compared to their sex matched Control peers. Interestingly, higher values of FA were observed in FASD compared to Control youth. Specifically, FASD girls had higher FA in the cerebellum, whereas FASD boys showed higher values in the posterior thalamic radiation, when compared to sex matched Controls. These novel findings provide evidence that PAE alters white matter microstructure in a sexually dimorphicmanner. Importantly, the present results have implications for understanding structural connectivity among regions that are implicated in cognitive, behavioral and mental health problems that occur at a high prevalence among individuals with an FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol has been linked to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) which includes a wide range of developmental deficits from non-detectable to severe mental retardation. Because women who abuse alcohol often ignore proper food intake, we investigate the contribution of nutritional disparity to FASD.We have previously observed that moderate alcohol and under-nourishment can independently cause partial and reversible facial dysmorphology, but moderate alcohol combined with under-nourishment exerted severe facial dysmorphology that could not be alleviated.We have also reported that DNA methylation is a programmed event playing a role in transcriptional regulation throughout neural development and that alcohol delays this epigenetic program and may contribute to FASD etiology. Because DNAmethylation depends on the availability ofmethyl donors, we set out to investigate the role of nutritional deficiency in alcohol-induced epigenetic alteration. Using an alcohol in liquid-diet mousemodel (4%v/v, across gestational days 7-17,) total free access nutrition was calorically matched to Chow controls but with 50-75%micronutrient deficiency. An alcohol-free isocaloric pair-fed (PF) control was also used. The cortices and cerebellumof all groups were immunostained with antibodies against DNA methylation markers 5-methylcytosine (5meC) and, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at postnatal day 7 and 21.We found that nutritional deficiency during gestation is independently capable of hindering the cell-specific DNA methylation program of the cerebellum which we have previously described. Specifically, nutritional deficiency was associated with an intranuclear reorganization of 5meC and 5hmC in addition to cellular growth restriction. Though this was also observed in alcohol-treated groups, nutritional deficiency exacerbated the eects of alcohol. This is in agreement with our long time observations of dysmorphogenesis at the rank of Alcohol> PF> Chow and further posits the question of whether nutritional supplementation can alleviate the burden of fetal alcohol. Preliminary evidence has indeed shown that nutritional supplementation can increase the daily intakes of liquid-diet of pregnant females. Due to the high incidence of nutritional insuciency associated with mothers who abuse alcohol during pregnancy, it is important to investigate the relationship between alcohol andmalnutrition further, as a step toward the development of a viable therapeutic.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal exposure to alcohol may negatively affect the developing brain with long term effects on development and behaviour. South Africa has a high prevalence of alcohol abuse and associated fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. A number of neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine systems are being implicated as underlying the association between maternal alcohol, and subsequent negative behavioural outcomes in offspring. In particular, the glutamatergic system, appears to be disrupted in offspring of rodent mothers exposed to stress. There has been relatively little work, however, on the glutamatergic system during early life in humans. This study aims to assess the effects ofmaternal alcohol use on infant neuronal integrity and glutamatergic function, as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Methods: Pregnant mothers in a Cape Town community were consented and further identified using the ASSIST questionnaire. Mothers screening positive for alcohol use in preganacy were administered a more detailed assessment of their alcohol use. Infants of these mothers as well as matched controls were assessed byMRS scan at 2-4 weeks of age performed during natural sleep. The MRS findings of index children were compared to that of the controls. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics committee. Results: Twenty eight infants aged between 2-4 weeks underwent MRS scans (12 controls, 15 alcohol-exposed infants, 1 infant was co-exposed to methamphetamines). Comparisons of group data on the findings from voxels placed over Parietal white matter (PWM) of infants exposed to alcohol prenatally showed significantly decreased Glx peak (Glu + Gln, p = 0.009) and significantly increased macromolecules and lipids (MM09 + Lip09, p = 0.007) (PWM nControl = 5, PWM nAlcohol=5).Parietal grey matter (PGM) of infants exposed to alcohol prenatally showed no significant differences (PGM nControl = 7, PWM nAlcohol=10). Discussion: This research advances understanding of the relevant mechanisms resulting in the neurological effects of alcohol and stimulant exposure. This may ultimately drive therapeutic approaches. The study offers an important opportunity to contribute to the protection of child health in South Africa and to further knowledge to benefit children in developing countries exposed to alcohol in pregnancy.

N2  - With Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) occurring in 2-5%of US live births, interventions are needed that assist women in reducing prenatal alcohol use to decrease the risk of FASD. This study determined the eectiveness of a single-session motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to decrease prenatal alcohol use. It also investigated the influence of self-determination theory mechanisms of basic psychological needs satisfaction and autonomous motivation on drinking behaviors. Of 184 women attending a prenatal visit (66%African American, mean age 25.4, mean weeks gestation 24.3), 122 women screened positive for previous year alcohol use asmeasured by the AUDIT or quantity/frequency measures of alcohol use. These women then completed the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS) and Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ) before randomization to an MI or comparison group. TheMI group received the intervention at the same or next prenatal visit. Both groups completed 30 day postbaseline (n = 92) and 30 day postpartum (n = 102) followups. Poisson regression using generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique to account for the repeated nature of the data found no significant main eects of MI on drink days per week, drinks per day, and total AUDIT scores. No interaction eects were noted, except for a significant interaction eect of MI on drink days per week showing the MI group to increase drink days per week, while the comparison group changed little across time. However, due to curvilinearity, strong caution is suggested when interpreting results. Linear regression using GEE did demonstrate a significant eect of time on BPNS and Relative Autonomy Index scores of the TSRQ with both increasing over time. In this study,MI was not found eective in decreasing prenatal alcohol use or in increasing basic psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivations to decrease prenatal alcohol use. However, future studies with increased numbers of data collection points would better allow interpretation and analysis of curvilinear relationships. Likewise, larger sample sizes with increased numbers of higher level drinkers would increase statistical power, as well as allow exploration of the eects of MI with women whose children are at higher risk for FASD. Additional sessions of the intervention, or booster interventions, are recommended to determineMI's ability to decrease prenatal alcohol use in the future.

N2  - This study aims to establish the incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure in the province of Prince Edward Island (PEI) in order to inform future public health initiatives addressing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. FASD in a leading preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disability in North America. Obtaining information about prenatal alcohol use in challenging via self-report due to the stigma associated with alcohol abuse in pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol exposure was investigated via population- based collection and analysis of meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE). FAEE are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol produced in the fetus and deposited into meconium. FAEE meconium concentrations greater than 2.0 nmol/g are indicative of frequent prenatal alcohol exposure during the last two trimesters of pregnancy. Meconium samples were collected from 1307 neonates born between November 2010 and November 2011 in hospitals on PEI or born to PEI-citizens giving birth at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Samples were frozen and shipped for analysis. FAEE were extracted via liquid-liquid extraction followed by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Four FAEE were quantified using deuterated internal standards; ethyl palmitate, ethyl linolate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate. Of 1307 samples collected, 1271 samples were successfully analyzed. Results were positive in 3.1%ofmeconium samples collected within the first twenty-four hours after delivery. It is estimated that approximately 40%of alcohol-exposed neonates will have FASD. This study suggests that approximately 1.3%of neonates born in the province will have FASD. This is the first province-wide study of fetal alcohol exposure conducted in Canada.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure has been associated with difficulties in inhibition and cognitive control. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is thought to play an important role in inhibitory processes, and dysfunction of the ACC has been implicated in other developmental disorders (e.g., ADHD). This study examined whether ACC volume was related to inhibition task performance in youth affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Method: Adolescents ages 12.5-16.9 (M = 14.9) with prenatal alcohol exposure (AE; n = 18) and non-exposed controls (CON; n = 18) were matched on age, sex, race, ethnicity, and SES. Participants underwent structural MRI and neurocognitive testing. Regional gray matter volumes for the left and rightACCwere determined using FreeSurfer v5.1.0 automated cortical parcellation. Rostral and caudal ACC regions were identified in each hemisphere (i.e., 4 ACC regions). Volumes were correlated with NEPSY-II Inhibition scaled scores for completion time and errors for naming, inhibition, and switching conditions (i.e., 6 performancemeasures). Data were analyzed using ANOVA, correlations, and regressions to examine the effects of group, ACC volumes, and group x volume interactions on Inhibition scores. Results: Right rostral and caudal ACC were smaller in AE than CON, above and beyond total brain volume (p < .05). Left ACC volumes did not significantly differ between groups. Scores on NEPSY-II Inhibition for the three timed conditions were poorer for AE than CON (p < .05). Errors commission rates did not differ by group. Interaction effects were observed for right caudal ACC with naming and inhibition conditions. For CON, greater caudal ACC volume related to poorer performance while for AE, larger caudal ACC volume related to better performance (p < .05). Conclusions: Right ACC volume was disproportionately smaller in children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure.While in typically developing adolescents, smaller right ACC volume related to better inhibition performance, in alcohol-exposed youth, smaller right ACC volumes related to worse inhibition performance. These results indicate altered structure-function relations in alcohol-exposed youth and may relate to altered brain development as well as neurocognitive deficits.

N2  - Background: The adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neuropsychological functioning are well documented. However the secondary disability of academic dysfunction is not fully understood, particularly in the reading domain. The current study examined the presence and prevalence of reading dysfunction (RD) in exposed children and the appropriateness of multiple RD definitions. Methods: 237 children (8-16y) were tested with the WISC-IV, WRAT-3, and CBCL. Two groups were tested: children with prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, n = 122) and nonexposed children (CON, n = 115). Follow-up analyses were conducted with an IQ-matched (p = .107) subsample (N = 157; AE, n = 78; CON, n = 79). Group differences on RD were tested using ANOVA. Three definitions of RD were compared: 1) discrepancy models, (IQ - WRAT-3 Reading) 2) low achievement (bottom 25th percentile defined by theWRAT-3 norms, control, and total samples for whole and matched analyses) and 3) cut-point of 1.5SD below the mean of the normative sample. Chi-square and 2- tailed z-tests were used to compare prevalence of RD. Regressions determined which RD definitions predicted CBCL School Problems. Results: AE performed significantly worse (p < .001) than CON on Reading, even when matched on IQ (p = .019). The discrepancy model failed to predict reading problems in either analysis. In the whole sample analysis, all other definitions of RD found higher prevalence rates (p < .001) of AE (22.1-64.6%) compared to CON (7.0-24.3%). In the matched analyses, low achievement definitions (bottom 25th forWRAT norms, control, and total matched sample) also found significantly higher prevalence rates (p < .038) of RD in AE (32.1-43.6%) compared to CON (17.7-24.1%). Using nondiscrepancy definitions, AE had higher prevalence of RD for the whole (AE: 44.25%, CON: 14.58%; z = 5.17, p < .001) and thematched (AE: 33.67%, CON: 18.45%, z = 2.19, p = .029) analyses. For both analyses, all non-discrepancy definitions of RD significantly predicted School Problems (p < .001). Conclusion: Exposed children have significantly lower reading performance and higher rates of RD compared to controls, above and beyond the effect of IQ. These data support discontinuing the use of the discrepancy definition in this population and reinforce the use of low achievement definitions, which predict school problems. Future research should aimto understand the mechanisms of these impairments.

N2  - Purpose: Sensory processing impairments are reported frequently among children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). This pilot study aimed to validate previous clinical and behavioral findings by examining physiological reactivity to discrete, non-noxious sensory stimuli using the Sensory Challenge Protocol (SCP), a laboratory paradigm used with children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. Methods: Twenty-three children ages 5 through 11 years (11 with FASD; 12 with typical development and no prenatal alcohol exposure) participated in a two group comparison study. Sensory processing behaviors were measured by parent-report using the Short Sensory Profile (SSP; Dunn, 1999). Physiological reactivity to sensation was examined during the SCP using 1) electrodermal skin reactivity (EDR), 2) heart rate (HR), 3) heart rate variability (HRV) and 4) salivary cortisol levels taken at baseline, 15 and 30 minutes after the SCP. Results: Children with FASD showed significantly lower average EDR maximum amplitude during four of six sensory and the recovery conditions compared to controls. Significant differences in HRV change from baseline were detected in two of six sensory conditions and recovery. No significant group differences in heart rate outcomes or salivary cortisol levels at baseline or 15 and 30 minutes post SCP were found. Conclusions: Differential autonomic responses (EDR and HRV) to sensation and during recovery, but no differences in neuroendocrine responses, were found between children with FASD compared to controls without alcohol exposure. The direction and magnitude of these experimental differences require further investigation to understand the biobehavioral interplay between sensory reactivity and sensory processing behaviors among children with FASD.

N2  - Introduction: Children with FASD or PAE frequently exhibit impairment on tasks measuring inhibition. Saccades are rapid eye movements that bring new visual targets onto the fovea of the retina, andmeasurement of eyemovement control is a powerful tool for assessing sensory,motor and cognitive function. Objective: To determine if a performance-based relationship exists between psychometric tests and eye tracking tasks in children with FASD. Methods: Data will be presented from a large test battery collected on children with FASD and/or PAE as part of the national NeuroDevNet FASD demonstration project in Canada. Participants for this dataset were aged 5-18 years and included those diagnosed with an FASD (n = 71), those with PAE but no clinical FASD diagnosis (n = 26), and typically developing controls (n = 93). Participants were tested on a neurobehavioral test battery, which included the NEPSY-II subtests of Auditory Attention and Response Set (measuring attention and inhibition) and Inhibition (measuring inhibition). Each participant completed a series of saccadic eye movement tasks: in one condition (antisaccade) the child was instructed to look away froma target presented on a computer screen, and in another condition (delayed memory-guided) the child was instructed to remember the locations of two sequentially presented peripheral targets and, after the appropriate go signal, look to the remembered locations of the targets in the order presented. Results: Both the FASD and the PAE groups performed worse than controls on measures of attention and inhibition. Compared with controls, the FASD groupmademore direction errors on the antisaccade task, and more timing errors (saccades made before the go signal) on thememory guided task. Among the FASD/PAE group, inhibition and switching errors were highly correlated with direction errors on the antisaccade task but not on thememory-guided task, and there were no significant correlations in the control group. Conclusion: This data suggests that response inhibition deficits in children with FASD/PAE are associated with difficulty controlling saccadic eye movements. The results of this study demonstrate that eyemovement control tasks directly relate to outcomemeasures obtained with psychometric tests that are used during FASD diagnosis, and may therefore help with early identification of children who would benefit from a multidisciplinary diagnostic assessment.

N2  - Arithmetic has been identified as a particularly sensitive developmental endpoint for prenatal alcohol exposure. Our Detroit behavioral data suggest that fetal alcohol-related impairment in arithmetic is mediated primarily by a specific deficit in the core quantity systeminvolving the ability to mentally represent and manipulate number, a finding that we have confirmed in a Cape Town cohort. Five parietal regions are known to be critical in number processing: left and right horizontal intraparietal sulcus (IPS), left and right posterior superior parietal lobe (PSPL), and left angular gyrus (AG). IPS is activated in tasks involving relative quantities (magnitude representation), left AG during manipulation of numbers in verbal form. 59 right-handed children (age 7.9-13.4 yr) were administered fMRI tasks in Cape Town, South Africa. Prenatal alcohol exposure was assessed by maternal interview for oz absolute alcohol (AA)/day averaged across pregnancy, AA/drinking occasion, and drinking frequency. 14 children were diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS), 21 non-syndromal heavily exposed, and 24 controls whosemothers abstained or drank no more than minimally. fMRI data were acquired during exact addition (EA) (e.g.,"2 + 3 = 5 or 6?") and proximity judgment (PJ) (e.g.,"Is 5 closer to 4 or 7?"). Each of these self-paced tasks comprised 3 task (40s), 3 control (40s) and 3 rest blocks (20s), which were interleaved. Runs for which children scored <60% were excluded. fMRI regions of interest were defined as spheres, radius 6 mm. Because the tasks were simplified, the groups did not differ in accuracy on either task. However, the FAS/PFAS group completed fewer sums correctly during PJ (F(2,44)=3.40,p < 0.05). Increased AA/day and AA/occasion were associated with decreased activation in right IPS during both tasks (rs ranged from -0.36 to-0.38, ps<0.05). Although brain activation was not related to accuracy during EA, activity in left PSPL related inversely to accuracy on PJ (r = -0.55, p < 0.001). The reduced activation in right IPS is consistent with our previous behavioral findings suggesting a fetal alcohol-related specific deficit in representation and manipulation of quantity. Greater activation in left PSPL by children who perform the PJ task more poorly suggests that this regionmay be used to compensate for the reduced facility in magnitude representation in this group.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure results in executive control impairments. The current study investigated blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response differences on spatial workingmemory (SWM) and Go/No-go (GNG) paradigms in children with and without prenatal alcohol exposure.We hypothesized that in comparison to controls, alcohol-exposed children would exhibit altered neural efficiency during both tasks with greater activation in regions associated with attention during response inhibition and less activation in regions associated with spatial processing. Methods: Two demographically and behaviorally matched groups of children (ages 8 to 18 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing SWM and GNG tasks: children with prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, n = 16) and controls (CON, n = 12). Functional data were analyzed using a 2 (Group) 9 2 (Task) mixed model approach. Results: Across tasks the main effect of Group (AE>CON) was significant (p < .05, cluster > 1024 ll) for bilateral prefrontal and precentral gyri and bilateral precuneus. The main effect of Task (GNG>SWM) was significant for cuneus, middle frontal and superior temporal gyri, striatum, cerebellum, anterior cingulate, and right precentral gyrus. The main effect of Task (SWM>GNG) was significant formiddle and superior frontal gyri, left precuneus, left insula, and bilateral temporal gyri. The GroupxTask interaction was significant for bilateral inferior and right middle frontal gyri, left inferior parietal lobule, cerebellar vermis, anterior cingulate, right angular gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus. Follow-up analyses indicated, with the exception of the cerebellar vermis and anterior cingulate, significantly greater activation for SWMthan GNG in the AE group, while the opposite pattern (GNG>SWM) was observed in the CON group. Discussion: Consistent with previous literature, the AE group demonstrated greater frontal and parietal activation during executive control then controls. Greater activation in the AE group compared to the CON group on both tasks implies neural inefficiency in this population. The interaction results indicate abnormal neural activation in regions associated with spatial processing, inhibition, and attention in the AE group compared to controls, implying frontal and parietal dysfunction and greater cognitive effort in the AE group.

N2  - Background: Deficits in executive function (EF) are a hallmark feature of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. The present study evaluated how behavioral ratings of EF are related to performance- based neuropsychological (NP)measures among alcohol-exposed children, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and controls. Method: As part of a multisite study, children with prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, n = 134), children with ADHD (ADHD, n = 90), and typically developing controls (CON, n = 166) were administered multiple NP measures of EF, and caregivers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Canonical correlations were performed within each group to assess the relationship between the clinical scales of the BRIEF Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) and Metacognition Index (MI) with corresponding NP linear composites derived from NP scores. Results: For the BRI, analyses yielded a significant (a=.05) canonical correlation of .30 for the AE group, but no canonical correlations were significant for the ADHD or CON groups. Structure coefficients indicated that the BRIEF Shift scale and the NP composites of inhibition and cognitive flexibility were significantly correlated with the canonical variate with large effect sizes. For theMI scale, analyses yielded significant canonical correlations of .51 for the ADHD group and .33 for the CON group. For the CON group, all scales and NP composites were correlated with the canonical variate with medium to large effect sizes. For the ADHD group, the BRIEF Initiate and Working Memory scales and NP composites of working memory, fluency, and rule violations were correlated with the canonical variate with medium to large effect sizes. Conclusions: This study is the first to evaluate convergent validity of the BRIEF in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Parent ratings of EF were found to be significantly associated with NP performance in each group; however, the pattern of association varied depending on the BRIEF index. The BRI index is more predictive of NP performance for the AE group, whereas the MI index is more predictive of NP performance within CON and ADHD groups. These results suggest that BRI ratings may be useful in identifying EF deficits in alcohol-exposed children, and may contribute to the specificity of a neurobehavioral profile of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Attention deficits are often observed in children with prenatal alcohol exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often diagnosed in this population. This study used an objective assessment tool to examine differences between alcohol-exposed and non-exposed children, with and without an ADHD diagnosis on core symptoms of ADHD: inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Method: Subjects (6-17y, M = 11.77) comprised four groups: alcohol-exposed with ADHD (AE+, n = 33), alcohol-exposed without ADHD (AE-, n = 19), non-exposed with ADHD (ADHD, n = 41), and non-exposed controls without ADHD (CON, n = 52). Subjects were evaluated with the Quotient ADHD System, which provides objective data on ADHD core symptoms. The system uses a motiontracking system to measure activity during a continuous performance task, measuring inattention and impulsivity. Data on six motion and six attention parameters were obtained and each dependent variable examined separately. Data were analyzed with a 2 (AE) x 2 (ADHD) between-subjects ANCOVA, using age as a covariate. Results: The AE x ADHD interaction was significant only for the number of commission errors (p = .040). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the average number of commission errors was significantly higher for the ADHD group compared to the CON and AE+ groups (p < .05). A significant main effect of ADHD diagnosis was observed on measures of omission errors, variability in response time, coefficient of variance, number of headmovements, distance, and area traveled (p < .05). The main effect of AE was significant on measures of omission errors, response latency, and variability in response time (p < .05). Conclusions: There was a high degree of similarity between alcohol-exposed children, regardless of ADHD diagnosis on this objectivemeasure of activity and attention. There was also a high degree of similarity between the AE groups and the non-exposed children with ADHD. However, impulsivity as measured by commission errors, was detected among the non-exposed children with ADHD but not in either alcohol-exposed group. Future studies should investigate the utility of the Quotient ADHD System in diagnosing individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and include expanded assessment of impulsivity, as thismeasure may aid in differential diagnosis of prenatal alcohol exposure versus ADHD due to other causes.

N2  - Background: Significant relations between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and conduct disorders (e.g., Larkby et al, 2011) and teacher-reported externalizing behavior and delinquency at age 7 have been reported (Sood, et al., 2001). However, it has also been suggested that studies of adjudicated/ clinical samples may overstate the risk of delinquency after PAE (Lynch, et al., 2003). Here we examine the relationship between PAE and late teen/young adult delinquent behavior in a prospective non-clinical/non-adjudicated cohort. Identifying risk for delinquent behaviors associated with PAEmay also be improved by using our previously validated TACER3 alcohol use screen to better identify maternal fetal risk drinking. Methods: At 19 yrs, 177 participants from our longitudinal prospectively identified cohort were assessed with the National Youth Survey of Delinquency providing both past year and ever delinquent behaviors. All "ever" delinquent items were entered into a Factor Analysis and multiple factors identified (e.g., theft, violence on person, non-violent destructive/theft). At-risk PAE was obtained via the TACER3 during pregnancy at the initial prenatal visit. The relation between PAE and late teen/ young adult delinquent behavior was evaluated using multiple regression controlling for other prenatal exposures and multiple maternal/caregiver variables. Results: After covariate control, including teen exposure to prior caregiver alcohol use (at age 14 years), PAE assessed with the TACER3 significantly predictedmultiple factors of late teen delinquent behavior. PAE was related to the following "past year" factors: delinquent behaviors (beta=.22, p = .003), non-violent destructive/theft (beta=.15, p = .05), violence on a person (beta=.15, p = .05), total criminal behavior (beta=.16, p = .04), and total negative behavior (beta=.16, p = .03). PAE was also marginally related to both the "past year" (beta=.14, p = .08) and "ever" theft factors (beta=.13, p = .08). Conclusions: Controlled analyses demonstrated that PAE assessed by the TACER3 is related to delinquent behavior in our non-adjudicated late teen/young adult sample. Further analyses will examine influences of early childhood externalizing behavior on this relationship throughmore sophisticated developmental modeling. The current results suggests that PAEs influence on early childhood delinquent behavior persists through young adulthood implying that early behavioral intervention is critical for positive adult outcome.

N2  - During the brain growth spurt period neurons are especially sensitive to the damaging eects of ethanol. This prenatal alcohol exposure causes impairment throughout the developing nervous system, potentially leading to mental retardation and behavioral abnormalities. Previous work from our lab has shown neonatal ethanol exposure to cause a significant reduction in the dendritic complexity and soma size of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from the caudate putamen at P30. Recent evidence also demonstrates that neonatal mice lacking both AC1 and AC8 (DKO) have increased vulnerability to ethanol-induced neurotoxicity in the developing striatum compared to wild type (WT) controls. Studies have shown striatum-dependent behaviors, such as executive functioning and working memory in adolescent and adult animals to be negatively impacted by neonatal ethanol exposure, however the impact on early behaviors have not been examined. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to determine the behavioral eects of neonatal ethanol exposure using various developmental measures, such as the postural reflex, negative geotaxis, and wire suspension tests. In addition, the grid hang test, which is dependent on striatal dopamine, and the tail suspension test examining hind-limb clasping, which is dependent on cortico-striatal BDNF, were assessed. WT and DKO mice were treated with a single dose of 2.5 g/kg ethanol or saline at postnatal day 6 (P6). At P7, P10, P14, P21, and P30 animals were subjected to the wire suspension, negative geotaxis, and postural reflex tests. Additionally at P14, P21, and P30 mice were tested in the grid hang and tail suspension tests. In WTand DKO mice, postnatal EtOH exposure had no eect on any behavioral test performed. Genetic deletion of AC1/8 decreased immobility time in the tail suspension test at both P21 and P30 as well as increased hind-limb clasping. These data suggest that although a single exposure to ethanol during the brain growth spurt period has been shown to cause long-term deficiencies in dendritic morphology and soma size of MSNs in the caudate putamen it does not aect the maturational parameters and behavioral tests examined here.

N2  - Background Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) comprises a triad of growth impairment, central nervous system dysfunction and characteristic facial features. Diagnosis is complex and often not recognised at an early age. The three facial features: short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip, are unique to FAS. Clinical examination is inherently subjective and apart from palpebral fissure length, minimal reference data is available in neonates. Establishing a standardised method and normal range would promote an objective assessment. Earlier diagnosis would enable earlier effective interventions. Methods Standardised digital facial photographs were taken of normal term Caucasian neonates. Mothers completed anonymous questionnaires about alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Photographs were assessed using Facial Analysis Software to obtain values for palpebral fissure length (PFL) and upper lip circularity (LC). Upper lip thinness and philtrum smoothness were ranked according to 5-point Likert Scale. Results 29 infants were studied, 17 male: 12 female. Mean gestational age 40.3 weeks (range 37.1-42.3), mean weight 3556g. 23 (79%) had no prenatal alcohol exposure whilst 6 had minimal exposure (1-2units/week). PFL measurements could be obtained from 21 photographs (72%) with mean of 15.6 mm (range 13.7-18.7mm). Upper lip and philtrum values could be determined in 24 (83%). Mean LC was 57.21 (range 31.4-128.2). Mean rank scores for upper lip and philtrum were both 3. Conclusion It has been possible to gain measurements of facial features in just over 3/4 of neonates studied, showing the feasibility of this technique in this age-group. Further results are needed to establish reference ranges.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure is the leading preventable cause of birth and developmental defects in the United States. Despite a growing body of knowledge about the spectrum of disorders resulting from fetal alcohol exposure, 1 in 9 pregnant women continues to drink alcohol during pregnancy, and a small percentage of pregnant women continues to binge drink. Health care providers do not consistently screen pregnant women for alcohol use, nor do health professionals necessarily know how to counsel pregnant women effectively about the risks of fetal alcohol exposure. In this article, we review the epidemiology of fetal alcohol exposure and discuss current strategies for screening and prevention of fetal alcohol exposure. We also explore the multiple barriers that exist toward reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancies from the patient, provider, and systems perspectives. Finally, we make recommendations for improved clinical and public health strategies to eliminate fetal alcohol exposure in the United States.Target Audience: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physiciansLearning Objectives: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to describe rates of fetal alcohol exposure in the United States, describe the demographic characteristics of women at highest risk for fetal alcohol exposure, counsel patients appropriately regarding the risk of poor fetal outcomes in association with fetal alcohol exposure, and understand the barriers to effective counseling about fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: The prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were determined in this fourth study of first-grade children in a South African community. Methods: Active case ascertainment methods were employed among 747 first-grade pupils. The detailed characteristics of children within the continuum of FASD are contrasted with randomly selected, normal controls on (i) physical growth and dysmorphology; (ii) cognitive/behavioral characteristics; and (iii) maternal risk factors. Results: The rates of specific diagnoses within the FASD spectrum continue to be among the highest reported in any community in the world. The prevalence (per 1,000) is as follows: fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)-59.3 to 91.0; partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS)-45.3 to 69.6; and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)-30.5 to 46.8. The overall rate of FASD is therefore 135.1 to 207.5 per 1,000 (or 13.6 to 20.9%). Clinical profiles of the physical and cognitive/behavioral traits of children with a specific FASD diagnosis and controls are provided for understanding the full spectrum of FASD in a community. The spectral effect is evident in the characteristics of the diagnostic groups and summarized by the total (mean) dysmorphology scores of the children: FAS = 18.9; PFAS = 14.3; ARND = 12.2; and normal controls, alcohol exposed = 8.2 and unexposed = 7.1. Documented drinking during pregnancy is significantly correlated with verbal (r = -0.253) and nonverbal ability (r = -0.265), negative behaviors (r = 0.203), and total dysmorphology score (r = 0.431). Other measures of drinking during pregnancy are significantly associated with FASD, including binge drinking as low as 3 drinks per episode on 2 days of the week. Conclusions: High rates of specific diagnoses within FASD were well documented in this new cohort of children. FASD persists in this community. The data reflect an increased ability to provide accurate and discriminating diagnoses throughout the continuum of FASD. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a congenital syndrome caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and is entirely preventable by abstinence from alcohol drinking during this time. Little is known about the prevalence of FAS and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Western countries. We present the results of FAS/partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) prevalence study and maternal characteristics in a sample of schoolchildren from a rural province of Croatia. This study involved seven elementary schools with 1,110 enrolled children attending 1st to 4th grade and their mothers. We used an active case ascertainment method with passive parental consent and Clarified IOM criteria. The investigation protocol involved maternal data collection and clinical examination of children. Out of 1,110 mothers, 917 (82.6%) answered the questionnaire. Alcohol exposure during pregnancy was admitted by 11.5%, regular drinking by 4.0% and binge drinking by 1.4% of questioned mothers. Clinical examination involved 824 (74.2%) schoolchildren and disclosed 14 (1.7%) with clinical signs of FAS and 41 (5.0%) of PFAS. The observed FAS prevalence, based on 74.2% participation rate, was 16.9, PFAS 49.7 and combined prevalence was 66.7/1,000 examined schoolchildren. This is the first FAS prevalence study based on active ascertainment among schoolchildren and pregnancy alcohol drinking analysis performed in a rural community of Croatia and Europe. High prevalence of FAS/PFAS and pregnancy alcohol consumption observed in this study revealed that FAS is serious health problem in rural regions as well as a need to develop future studies and preventive measures for pregnancy alcohol drinking and FASD.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a growing concern in South Africa. In the Western Cape, prevalence rates for FAS are the highest in the world. Not surprisingly, the Western Cape also has some of the highest levels of alcohol consumption per capita. Although FAS is primarily caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the high rate of FAS in South Africa originates from a multitude of complex factors. These factors include heritage, poverty, high levels of unemployment and low-paid menial jobs, depression, low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, increased accessibility to alcohol, lack of recreation, poor education, familial pressure, denial, cultural misconceptions and the smaller physiques of some of the women in the Western Cape. Holistic and comprehensive macro- and micro-level approaches are necessary in order to change the alcohol consumption trend that has developed over the last 300 years. No single strategy will reduce or eliminate the burden of alcohol misuse in this society. However, as the presented discussion suggests, combining the spirit of motivational interviewing (MI) with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) practice, borrowed from health psychological interventions for lifestyle-related chronic health conditions, holds promise for reducing the prevalence of FAS within Western Cape communities. These individual-based approaches have yet to be employed in South Africa despite the wealth of evidence that demonstrates their potential in targeting high-risk groups and reducing per capita alcohol consumption. © SAAFP.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol has consistently been associated with adverse effects on neurodevelopment, which is collectively called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Increasing evidence suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol increases the risk of developing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like behavior in human. In this study, we investigated the behavioral effects of prenatal exposure to EtOH in offspring mice and rats focusing on hyperactivity and impulsivity. We also examined changes in dopamine transporter and MeCP2 expression, which may underlie as a key neurobiological and epigenetic determinant in FASD and hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive behaviors. Mouse or rat offspring born from dam exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (EtOH group) showed hyper locomotive activity, attention deficit and impulsivity. EtOH group also showed increased dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter level compared to control group in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Prenatal exposure to EtOH also significantly decreased the expression of MeCP2 in both prefrontal cortex and striatum. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to EtOH induces hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive behaviors in rodent offspring that might be related to global epigenetic changes as well as aberration in catecholamine neurotransmitter transporter system. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Objectives To examine alcohol-use disorders in pregnant women and the extent of under-reporting. Design Population-based cohort study. Setting Western Australia. Population Women with a birth recorded on the Western Australian Midwives Notification System (1985-2006). Methods Mothers with an International Classification of Diseases 9/10 alcohol-related diagnosis, indicating heavy alcohol consumption, recorded on population-based health datasets (non-Aboriginal n = 5839; Aboriginal n = 2583) were identified through the Western Australian data-linkage system. This 'exposed' cohort was frequency matched (on maternal age, year of birth of offspring, Aboriginal status) with comparison mothers without an alcohol-related diagnosis (non-Aboriginal n = 33 979; Aboriginal n = 8005). Main outcome measures Trends in maternal alcohol diagnoses in relation to pregnancy for non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal women. The proportion of children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) who had a mother with an alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy. Results The proportion of Aboriginal mothers in Western Australia with an alcohol diagnosis (23.1%) is ten times greater than for non-Aboriginal mothers (2.3%). There has been a six-fold increase in the percentage of non-Aboriginal births with a maternal alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy and a 100-fold increase for Aboriginal births. Around 70% of the mothers of children diagnosed with FAS did not have an alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy and 18% of the mothers had no record of an alcohol diagnosis. Conclusions Maternal alcohol exposure during pregnancy is significantly under-ascertained. Given the severe risks to the fetus from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, assessment and recording of alcohol use should be routinely undertaken in maternity and other health settings. © 2013 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology © 2013 RCOG.

N2  - Children prenatally exposed to tobacco exhibit higher rates of learning and emotional-behavioral problems related to worse working memory performance. Brain function, however, among tobacco exposed children while performing a working memory task has not previously been examined. This study compared the brain function of tobacco-exposed (n = 7) and unexposed (n = 11) 12-year-olds during a number N-back working memory task using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design. Prenatal alcohol exposure, neonatal medical problems, environmental risk, and sex were statistically controlled. Tobacco-exposed children showed greater activation in inferior parietal regions, whereas unexposed children showed greater activation in inferior frontal regions. These differences were observed in the context of correct responses, suggesting that exposed and unexposed children use different brain regions and approaches to succeed in working memory tasks. Implications for future research and intervention are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol leads to widespread cognitive deficits, including problems with attention and response inhibition. This study examined blood oxygen level-dependent response in children with and without histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during a task of response inhibition consisting of cued and noncued trials. Methods: Children and adolescents (ages 8 to 18 years) with (alcohol-exposed [AE] = 20) and without (control [CON] = 15) histories of heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a go/no-go task. Unbeknownst to subjects, a predictive cue preceded the no-go stimulus in 87% of trials. Results: Groups were matched on demographic variables and did not differ on most measures of task performance. However, following cued stimuli, the AE group demonstrated a lower hit rate to go stimuli and more conservative response bias than the CON group. AE participants demonstrated more activation during no-go trials (inhibition) relative to go trials in the left precuneus, cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate, and right medial frontal gyrus. During cue-dependent response inhibition, the AE group demonstrated less activation in the left precentral and postcentral gyrus compared to the CON group. Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies of response inhibition, the AE group demonstrated greater frontal and parietal activation when attempting to inhibit prepotent responses than the CON group, despite similar rates of commission errors. This study further demonstrated that the AE group had impaired behavioral performance on cued trials and demonstrated less activation in precentral and postcentral gyri relative to the CON group on these trials. This investigation provides evidence of impaired behavioral and neural processing of sequential information in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, which can help improve inhibition in typical populations. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objectives This study compares the behavioral profile of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) who were diagnosed using the Canadian Guidelines with children with prenatal alcohol exposure who did not meet criteria for a FASD diagnosis. Methods and Procedures To accomplish this, we used caregiver and teacher questionnaires evaluating different aspects of behavior. Investigated were 170 children, 109 who received a diagnosis of FASD (Diagnosed Group) and 61 who did not (Non-Diagnosed Group). On the caregiver report, children in the Diagnosed Group had more internalizing and externalizing problems on the CBCL, more executive function difficulties on the BRIEF and more attention problems on the Conner's Rating Scale, compared to the Non-Diagnosed Group. On teacher report, children in the Diagnosed Group had more internalizing and externalizing problems on the TRF and more attention problems on the Conner's Rating Scale, compared to the Non-Diagnosed Group. For both informants, more children in the Diagnosed group had scores in the clinically elevated range. Conclusion Overall, the present results identify key caregiver and teacher-rated profiles of children with FASD diagnoses. These profiles will aid in better understanding, diagnosing and providing focused treatment approaches for children with FASD. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Objective Children with FASD display a heterogeneous profile and may have deficits in physical, behavioural, emotional, and social functioning, as the result of prenatal alcohol exposure. The major objective of the current study was to identify if a specific pattern of neuropsychological functioning exists among children prenatally exposed to alcohol who received a diagnosis, versus exposed children who did not. We compared groups on domains of intellectual functioning, memory, attention, executive functioning, motor functioning, language/communication and achievement. Methods One hundred and seventy children who were seen in the clinic between 2005 and 2009 were included in this study. Out of the total 170 children seen, 109 received an FASD diagnosis. Results We identified a specific neuropsychological profile that typifies children diagnosed with an FASD versus those exposed prenatally to alcohol, who did not receive a diagnosis. Diagnosed children displayed a neuropsychological profile characterized by weaknesses in the areas of verbal reasoning, memory, overall language functioning, math reasoning and calculation. Groups did not differ on measures of attention or executive functioning. Conclusion The information gained from these analyses, are essential for informing best practices for diagnosis and treatment. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - According to the World Health Organization, alcohol is the third most dangerous factor following smoking of tobacco and hypertension of risks impacting health of the population. 50 % of men and 10 % of women suffer from diseases caused by alcohol drinking. Chronic consumption of alcohol damages the nervous system, causes adverse changes in the circulatory system and intestine, increases the risk of cancers. Comparing the impact of alcohol on the health of women and men, in case of women, even similar levels of consumption cause stronger action. Alcohol is the cause of endocrine diseases and among others- reduces fertility. It is the risk factor of premature deliveries, abortions, and placenta- associated pathologies. Disorders of children with prenatal exposure to alcohol are described as fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorders and alcohol related birth defects. It is recommended to impose a total ban on alcohol consumption by pregnant women. Moreover one should emphasize that the minimum safe dose of alcohol for the foetus cannot be specified. In order to resolve alcohol drinking problems a cooperation of representatives of many professions such as: doctors, psychologists, educators and employees of care facilities is necessary. It is also obligatory to obtain support and assistance from the nearest surroundings of the patient.

N2  - Background: Inconsistent data on the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and a range of pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA) raise new questions. This study aimed to assess whether the association between low-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and PTB and SGA differs according to maternal education, maternal mental distress or maternal smoking.Methods: The Amsterdam Born Children and their Development (ABCD) Study (N = 5,238) and the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) (N = 16,301) are both large studies. Women provide information on alcohol intake in early pregnancy, 3 months postpartum and up to 17 years retrospectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses and stratified regression analyses were performed to examine the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and PTB and SGA, respectively.Results: No association was found between any level of prenatal alcohol exposure (non-daily, daily, non-abstaining) and SGA. The offspring of daily drinkers and non-abstainers had a lower risk of PTB [ABCD: odds ratio (OR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13, 0.77; KiGGS: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57, 0.99]. Interactions with maternal education, maternal distress or maternal smoking were not significant.Conclusions: Although these results should be interpreted with caution, both studies showed no adverse effects of low-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on PTB and SGA, not even in the offspring of women who were disadvantaged in terms of low education, high levels of distress, or smoking during pregnancy. © 2013 Pfinder et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - Powers and faden's theory of social justice applied to the problem of foetal alcohol syndrome in South Africa
A1  - Horn L.
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - South Africa has the highest rate of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the world. The problem of alcohol abuse in pregnancy has very deep historical roots that are intertwined with the injustices of both apartheid and pre-apartheid colonialism. Much of the research that is being done in these communities is focused on identifying the epidemiological variables associated with these patterns of alcohol abuse. The underlying reasons as to why these patterns continue seem to remain largely obscured from view. In this article, I apply the theory proposed by Powers and Faden of social justice as a 'moral foundation for public health and health policy' to the problem of FAS in South Africa. The objective of this application is two-fold: first, to critically explore the additional insights and alternative perspectives to the problem of FAS that this approach may provide and second, to assess the utility of the theory when applied directly to a specific public health problem. I conclude by noting that although this approach could result in the kind of 'public health scope creep' that has been criticized by various authors, it does provide fresh insights to the problem of FAS in South Africa. © 2013 The Author.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable, biomarkers of alcohol use are sometimes necessary to accurately determine fetal risk. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG), a direct metabolite of ethanol, has been detected in the meconium of infants born to mothers who consumed excessive alcohol during pregnancy. It is still unknown whether EtG detected in meconium originated from maternal hepatic glucuronidation of ethanol followed by subsequent placental transfer. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if EtG crosses the human placenta. Methods: The transfer of EtG was measured using the ex vivo dual perfusion of an isolated human placental lobule. EtG (1 mug/mL) was added to the maternal circulation and samples were taken throughout the 1 h pre-experimental and 3 h experimental phases for measurement of EtG and markers of placental viability. Results: After 3 h, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 0.29 +/- 0.02 and net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring. Triplicate averages of EtG concentrations in perfused placental lobules ranged from 140 to 414 ng/g tissue. Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all perfusions. Discussion: The data show that EtG crosses the human placenta and primarily represents maternal exposure to alcohol. Conclusions: This information can help with the development of more thorough biomarker screens for alcohol use during pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: This study examined prevalence of psychiatric disorders and behavioral problems in children with and without prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: Primary caregivers of 344 children (8 to 16 years, M = 12.28) completed the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV (C-DISC-4.0) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Subjects comprised 4 groups: AE with ADHD (AE+, n = 85) and without ADHD (AE-, n = 52), and nonexposed with ADHD (ADHD, n = 74) and without ADHD (CON, n = 133). The frequency of specific psychiatric disorders, number of psychiatric disorders (comorbidity), and CBCL behavioral scores were examined using chi-square and analysis of covariance techniques. Results: Clinical groups had greater frequency of all psychiatric disorders, except for anxiety, where the AE- and CON groups did not differ. There was a combined effect of AE and ADHD on conduct disorder. For comorbidity, children with ADHD had increased psychiatric disorders regardless of AE, which did not have an independent effect on comorbidity. For CBCL scores, there were significant main effects of AE and ADHD on all scores and significant AE x ADHD interactions for Withdrawn/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, Attention, and all Summary scores. There was a combined effect of AE and ADHD on Externalizing, Total Problems, and Attention Problems. Conclusions: Findings indicate that ADHD diagnosis elevates children's risk of psychiatric diagnoses, regardless of AE, but suggest an exacerbated relation between AE and ADHD on conduct disorder and externalizing behavioral problems in children. Findings affirm a poorer behavioral prognosis for alcohol-exposed children with ADHD and suggest that more than 1 neurobehavioral profile may exist for individuals with AE. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) results in a broad array of neurobehavioral deficits. Recent research has focused on identification of a neurobehavioral profile or profiles that will improve the identification of children affected by AE. This study aimed to build on our preliminary neurobehavioral profile to improve classification accuracy and test the specificity of the resulting profile in an alternate clinical group. Methods: A standardized neuropsychological test battery was administered to 3 groups of children: subjects with AE (n = 209), typically developing controls (CON, n = 185), and subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n = 74). We assessed a large sample from 6 sites in the United States and South Africa, using standardized methodology. Data were analyzed using 3 latent profile analyses including (i) subjects with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and controls, (ii) subjects with AE without FAS and controls, and (iii) subjects with AE (with or without FAS) and subjects with ADHD. Results: Classification accuracy was moderate but significant across the 3 analyses. In analysis 1, overall classification accuracy was 76.1% (77.2% FAS, 75.7% CON). In the second analysis, overall classification accuracy was 71.5% (70.1% AE/non-FAS, 72.4% CON). In the third analysis, overall classification accuracy was 73.9% (59.8% AE, 75.7% ADHD). Subjects that were misclassified were examined for systematic differences from those that were correctly classified. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the neuropsychological effects of AE are clinically meaningful and can be used to accurately distinguish alcohol-affected children from both typically developing children and children with ADHD. Further, in combination with other recent studies, these data suggest that approximately 70% of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure are neurobehaviorally affected, while the remaining 30% are spared these often-devastating consequences, at least those in the domains under study. Refining the neurobehavioral profile will allow improved identification and treatment development for children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objective: Classic facial characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) are shortened palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, and thin upper vermillion. We aim to help pediatricians detect facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum, especially among nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) individuals without classic facial characteristics. Methods: Of 192 Cape Coloured children recruited, 69 were born to women who reported abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy. According to multifaceted criteria, the remainder were allocated clinically to the FAS (n = 22), partial FAS (n = 26) or nonsyndromal HE (n = 75) categories. We used dense surface modeling and signature analyses of 3-dimensional facial photographs to determine agreement between clinical categorization and classifications induced from face shape alone, to visualize facial differences, and to consider predictive links between face shape and neurobehavior. Results: Face classification achieved significant agreement with clinical categories for discrimination of nonexposed from FAS alone (face: 0.97-1.00; profile: 0.92) or with the addition of partial FAS (face: 0.90; profile: 0.92). Visualizations of face signatures delineated dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum and in half of the nonsyndromal HE category face signature graphs detected facial characteristics consistent with prenatal alcohol exposure. This subgroup performed less well on IQ and learning tests than did nonsyndromal subjects without classic facial characteristics. Conclusions: Heat maps and morphing visualizations of face signatures may help clinicians detect facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum. Face signature graphs show potential for identifying nonsyndromal heavily exposed children who lack the classic facial phenotype but have cognitive impairment.

N2  - Maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy may cause potentially severe short and long-term damage to the fetus and in the childhood .These consequences appears at an unknown alcohol concentration threshold and are reported as "fetal alcoholization syndrome (FAS) " or " alcoholic fetal effects (AFE)". The FAS includes fetal growth delay, facial dysmorphy but especially neuro-psycho-behavioral development delay. The AFE includes essentially these cognitive and psychosocial disorders. If 25 % of the pregnant women take alcohol during their pregnancy, from 1,5 to 5 % would consume at least 2 AU (alcohol's unit) a day. The FAS incidence among heavy drinkers would be from 30 to 40 %. FAS Prevalence is around 1,9 % of livebirths. Other risks of alcohol intake during pregnancy are preterm delivery, low birth weight, increased incidence of miscarriage and stillbirth. Alcohol unrelated congenital malformations could be also associated with alcohol intake. As the critical toxic thresholds for AFE is unknown, the "zero tolerance" (of alcohol consumption) should be recommended to any pregnant women. An early patients at risk screening associated with adequate information and support are the most effective actions for reducing both AFE incidence and severity. The FAS diagnosis should be offered as early as possible in the newborn and even in utero for allowing an optimal global care.

N2  - Alcohol exposed pregnancy (AEP) is a leading cause of preventable birth defects. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that multi-session motivational interviewing-based interventions reduce AEP risk, a one-session intervention could facilitate broader implementation. The purposes of this study were to: (1) test a one-session motivational AEP prevention intervention for community women and (2) compare outcomes to previous RCTs. Participants at risk for AEP (N=217) were randomized to motivational interviewing. +. assessment feedback (EARLY), informational video, or informational brochure conditions. Outcomes were drinks per drinking day (DDD), ineffective contraception rate, and AEP risk at 3 and 6. months. All interventions were associated with decreased DDD, ineffective contraception rate, and AEP risk. Participants who received EARLY had larger absolute risk reductions in ineffective contraception and AEP risk, but not DDD. Effect sizes were compared to previous RCTs. The one-session EARLY intervention had less powerful effects than multi-session AEP prevention interventions among community women, but may provide a new option in a continuum of preventive care. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Excessive alcohol use accounted for an estimated average of 23,000 deaths and 633,000 years of potential life lost (YPLL) among women and girls in the United States each year during 2001-2005. Binge drinking accounted for more than half of those deaths and YPLL. Binge drinking also is a risk factor for many health and social problems among women and girls, including unintended and alcohol-exposed pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and breast cancer. Methods: To describe the prevalence, frequency, and intensity of binge drinking (four or more drinks on an occasion in the last 30 days) among U.S. women aged >18 years, CDC analyzed data from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Data were also analyzed from the 2011 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey on the prevalence of current alcohol use (one or more drinks during the past 30 days) and binge drinking (five or more drinks in a row during the past 30 days) among U.S. high school girls in grades 9-12. Results: Among adult women, the prevalence of binge drinking was 12.5%, and among those who binge drank, the frequency of binge drinking was 3.2 episodes per month and the intensity was 5.7 drinks on occasion. Binge drinking was most prevalent among women aged 18-24 years (24.2%) and 25-34 years (19.9%), and among those from households with annual incomes of >$75,000 (16.0%). Among those who binge drank, women aged 18-24 years had the highest frequency (3.6 episodes) and intensity (6.4 drinks) of binge drinking. Among high school girls, the prevalence of current alcohol use was 37.9%, the prevalence of binge drinking was 19.8%, and the prevalence of binge drinking among girls who reported current alcohol use was 54.6%. Conclusions: Binge drinking is reported by one in eight U.S. adult women and one in five high school girls. Women who binge drink tend to do so frequently and with high intensity. Most high school girls who reported current alcohol use also reported binge drinking. Implications for Public Health Practice: More widespread implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as those recommended by the Guide to Community Preventive Services and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, would be expected to reduce the frequency and intensity, and ultimately the prevalence of binge drinking among women and girls, and the harms related to it.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure can result in diverse and extensive damage to the central nervous system, including the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. Given that these brain regions are involved in the generation and maintenance of motor force, we predicted that prenatal alcohol exposure would adversely affect this parameter of motor control. We previously reported that children with gestational alcohol exposure experience significant deficits in regulating isometric (i.e., constant) force. The purpose of this study was to determine whether these children exhibit similar deficits when producing isotonic (i.e., graded) force. Methods: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and typically developing children completed a series of isotonic force contractions by exerting force on a load cell to match a criterion target force displayed on a computer monitor. Two levels of target force (5 or 20% of maximum voluntary force) were investigated in combination with varying levels of visual feedback. Results: Compared with control children, children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure generated isotonic force signals that were less accurate, more variable, and less complex in the time domain. Specifically, interactions were found between group and visual feedback for response accuracy and signal complexity, suggesting that these children have greater difficulty altering their motor output when visual feedback is low. Conclusions: These data suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure produces deficits in regulating isotonic force, which presumably result from alcohol-related damage to developing brain regions involved in motor control. These children will most likely experience difficulty performing basic motor skills and daily functional skills that require coordination of finely graded force. Therapeutic strategies designed to increase feedback and, consequently, facilitate visual-motor integration could improve isotonic force production in these children. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Genetic factors are involved in variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which is also observed among various inbred mouse strains. The CD1 mouse strain is often used in toxicological and genetic experiments. However, there is little literature using this strain to study long-term neurologic abnormalities of FASD. In the present study, we addressed the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on neurological alterations in adult CD1 mice. The female CD1 mice received exposure to ethanol solution (10 vol%) starting from 2 weeks before mating up to pups born (postnatal day 1). At 24 weeks after the birth, the prenatal ethanol-exposed mice and control mice showed no difference in spatial learning and memory performance in a Morris water maze. Consistently, pathological changes, such as increased neuronal apoptosis, decreased synaptic protein synaptophysin expression, synaptic loss and reactive astrogliosis, were not observed in the hippocampus of mice prenatally exposed to ethanol. These results suggest that CD1 mice are highly resistant to prenatal alcohol exposure and may serve as genetic modification models of FASD. Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T1  - Alcohol use in pregnancy: Insights in screening and intervention for the clinician

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy remains a common occurrence and is associated with a multitude of adverse birth and long-term outcomes. Binge drinking in particular is shown to be particularly harmful to the developing fetus. Effects include full fetal alcohol syndrome, with characteristic facial dysmorphology, growth restriction, and developmental to delays. Exposed children may also have partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related birth defects, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. These effects are preventable, and efforts must begin with accurate identification of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. Several screening tools have been developed and validated for use in prenatal care settings, and the most recently proposed brief and easy to use T-ACER3 has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in both identifying risk drinking during pregnancy and predicting long-term neurobehavioral outcomes in exposed children. Once identified, effective interventions are available for use with pregnant women consuming alcohol. Brief interventions, which can be delivered by a health professional and involve motivational interviewing, have been demonstrated to significantly reduce alcohol consumption during pregnancy. These approaches, recommended by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG), help move patients toward increased readiness to positively change their drinking behavior. Ultimately, all prenatal care providers should routinely screen all patients for alcohol use using validated tools, and where appropriate, should offer intervention. © 2013, Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol is strongly associated with poor cognitive outcomes particularly in relation to learning and memory. It is also becoming more evident that anxiety disorders and anxiety-like behaviour can be associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This study used a rat model to determine if prenatal exposure to a relatively small amount of alcohol would result in anxiety-like behaviour and to determine if this was associated with morphological changes in the basolateral amygdala. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were fed a liquid diet containing either no alcohol (Control) or 6% (vol/vol) ethanol (EtOH) throughout gestation. Male and Female offspring underwent behavioural testing at 8 months (Adult) or 15 months (Aged) of age. Rats were perfusion fixed and brains were collected at the end of behavioural testing for morphological analysis of pyramidal neuron number and dendritic morphology within the basolateral amygdala. EtOH exposed offspring displayed anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze, holeboard and emergence tests. Although sexually dimorphic behaviour was apparent, sex did not impact anxiety-like behaviour induced by prenatal alcohol exposure. This increase in anxiety - like behaviour could not be attributed to a change in pyramidal cell number within the BLA but rather was associated with an increase in dendritic spines along the apical dendrite which is indicative of an increase in synaptic connectivity and activity within these neurons. This study is the first to link increases in anxiety like behaviour to structural changes within the basolateral amygdala in a model of prenatal ethanol exposure. In addition, this study has shown that exposure to even a relatively small amount of alcohol during development leads to long term alterations in anxiety-like behaviour. © 2013 Cullen et al.

N2  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading cause of preventable intellectual disabilities in the United States and a significant public health issue. Objectives The purpose of this study is to evaluate the knowledge and screening practices of pre-clinical medical students and clinical providers on FAS, FASD, and alcohol consumption. Methods A short survey sent to medical students and residents on the campus of a large medical school and university hospital. Results On the survey of clinical providers, 38% of respondents stated they always survey pregnant women about their alcohol consumption, 34% stated they always screen patients planning to get pregnant, and 9% screen women of childbearing age. There were a significant percentage of providers who never screen women. When questioned regarding safe amounts of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, 69% of preclinical medical students and 67% of clinical providers stated there is no safe amount of alcohol consumption. Clinical providers were much more likely to correctly select the facial features necessary for the diagnosis (p-value < 0.01). Conclusions Significant differences exist in the knowledge and screening practices of these different healthcare providers and trainees. Future interventions should seek to improve knowledge on FAS, FASD, and alcohol consumption, in order for practitioners to be more consistent with national guidelines and the Surgeon General recommendations. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - The characteristics of fetal acohol spectrum disorders (FASD) constitute a specific facial phenotype, growth failure and neurodevelopmental defects. Reported FASD prevalences vary widely from 0.08 per 1,000 up to 68.0-89.2 per 1,000. We aimed to evaluate to which extent children referred with a suspicion of FASD, indeed have FASD. We included all 27 children referred to our genetic department with a suspicion of FASD between 2005 and 2010. Nineteen children (70.3%) were of non-Dutch ancestry, and 24 (88.9%) had been adopted. We used both the 4-Digit Code and the Revised Institute of Medicine criteria. More than half of the children did not meet either criteria for the diagnosis of FASD. Of note, after evaluation 8/27 children appeared not to have confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure. Two children referred for suspicion of FASD (neither of which were exposed to alcohol or met the criteria for FASD) had a pathogenic microstructural chromosomal rearrangement (del16p11.2 of 542KB and dup1q44 of 915KB). In 22/24 children (91.7%) there were other factors that may have affected their intellectual abilities, such as familial intellectual disability and social deprivation. We recommend a critical approach towards the diagnosis FASD, and to investigate all patients suspected to have FASD for other causative factors including genetic abnormalities. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - To extend our current understanding of the teratogenic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the control of isometric force, the present study investigated the signal characteristics of power spectral density functions resulting from sustained control of isometric force by children with and without heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol. It was predicted that the functions associated with the force signals would be fundamentally different for the two groups. Twenty-five children aged between 7 and 17. years with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 21 non-alcohol exposed control children attempted to duplicate a visually represented target force by pressing on a load cell. The level of target force (5 and 20% of maximum voluntary force) and the time interval between visual feedback (20. ms, 320. ms and 740. ms) were manipulated. A multivariate spectral estimation method with sinusoidal windows was applied to individual isometric force-time signals. Analysis of the resulting power spectral density functions revealed that the alcohol-exposed children had a lower mean frequency, less spectral variability, greater peak power and a lower frequency at which peak power occurred. Furthermore, mean frequency and spectral variability produced by the alcohol-exposed group remained constant across target load and visual feedback interval, suggesting that these children were limited to making long-time scale corrections to the force signal. In contrast, the control group produced decreased mean frequency and spectral variability as target force and the interval between visual feedback increased, indicating that when feedback was frequently presented these children used the information to make short-time scale adjustments to the ongoing force signal. Knowledge of these differences could facilitate the design of motor rehabilitation exercises that specifically target isometric force control deficits in alcohol-exposed children. © 2012.

N2  - Background: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure often meet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD research has examined subtype differences in symptomatology, including sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT). This construct is defined by behavioral symptoms including hypoactivity and daydreaming and has been linked to increased internalizing behaviors. The current study examined whether similar findings are displayed in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: As part of a multisite study, caregivers of 272 children (8 to 16 years) completed the SCT Scale and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Four groups were included: alcohol-exposed children with ADHD (ALC+; n = 75), alcohol-exposed children without ADHD (ALC-; n = 35), nonexposed children with ADHD (ADHD; n = 60), and nonexposed children without ADHD (CON; n = 102). SCT and CBCL scores were analyzed using 2 (exposure) x 2 (ADHD) analyses of variance. Pearson's correlations measured the relationships between SCT, CBCL, and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ). Discriminant function analysis examined whether SCT items could accurately classify groups. Results: Analyses revealed significant main effects of exposure and ADHD on SCT and internalizing and externalizing scores and significant interaction effects on SCT and internalizing scores. SCT significantly correlated with internalizing, externalizing, and attention ratings in all groups and with FSIQ in ALC+. Discriminant function analysis indicated that specific SCT items could distinguish ALC- from CON. Conclusions: Alcohol-exposed children exhibited elevated SCT scores. Elevations were related to increased parent ratings of internalizing and externalizing behaviors and attention. These findings are observed in alcohol-exposed children regardless of ADHD symptoms and specific SCT items proved useful in distinguishing exposed children, suggesting clinical utility for this measure in further defining the neurobehavioral profile related to prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can have serious and permanent adverse effects. The developing brain is the most vulnerable organ to the insults of prenatal alcohol exposure. A behavioral phenotype of prenatal alcohol exposure including conduct disorders is also described. This study on a sample of Brazilian adolescents convicted for criminal behavior aimed to evaluate possible clinical features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). These were compared to a control group of school adolescents, as well as tested for other environmental risk factors for antisocial behavior. A sample of 262 institutionalized male adolescents due to criminal behavior and 154 male students aged between 13 and 21 years comprised the study population. Maternal use of alcohol was admitted by 48.8% of the mothers of institutionalized adolescents and by 39.9% of the school students. In this sample of adolescents we could not identify individual cases with a clear diagnosis of FAS, but signs suggestive of FASD were more common in the institutionalized adolescents. Social factors like domestic and family violence were frequent in the risk group, this also being associated to maternal drinking during pregnancy. The inference is that in our sample, criminal behavior is more related to complex interactions between environmental and social issues including prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Although it is well documented that heavy consumption of alcohol during pregnancy impairs brain development, it remains controversial whether moderate consumption causes significant damage. Using a limited access, voluntary consumption paradigm, we recently demonstrated that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (MPAE) is associated with dentate gyrus-dependent learning and memory deficits that are manifested in adulthood. Here, we identified a novel mechanism that may underlie this effect of MPAE. We found that MPAE mice exhibit deficits in NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus. Further, using semiquantitative immunoblotting techniques, we found that the levels of GluN2B subunits were decreased in the synaptic membrane, while levels of C2'-containing GluN1 and GluN3A subunits were increased, in the dentate gyrus of MPAE mice. These data suggest that MPAE alters the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs, leading to impaired NMDAR-dependent LTP in the dentate gyrus. © 2013 the authors.

N2  - Little is known about the effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure on white matter microstructure, and the impact of concomitant alcohol exposure. Diffusion tensor imaging and neurocognitive testing were performed on 21 children with prenatal methamphetamine exposure (age 9.8+/-1.8 years; 17 also exposed to alcohol), 19 children with prenatal alcohol but not methamphetamine exposure (age 10.8+/-2.3 years) and 27 typically developing children (age 10.3+/-3.3 years). Whole-brain maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistics. Relative to unexposed controls, children with prenatal methamphetamine exposure demonstrated higher FA mainly in left-sided regions, including the left anterior corona radiata (LCR) and corticospinal tract Post-hoc analyses of these FA differences showed they likely result more from lower radial diffusivity (RD) than higher axial diffusivity (AD). Relative to the methamphetamine-exposed group, children with prenatal alcohol exposure showed lower FA in frontotemporal regions-particularly, the right external capsule. We failed to find any group-performance interaction (on tests of executive functioning and visuomotor integration) in predicting FA; however, FA in the right external capsule was significantly associated with performance on a test of visuomotor integration across groups. This report demonstrates unique diffusion abnormalities in children with prenatal methamphetamine/polydrug exposure that are distinct from those associated with alcohol exposure alone, and illustrates that these abnormalities in brain microstructure are persistent into childhood and adolescence - long after the polydrug exposure in utero. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background When examining the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal effects, the timing and intensity of exposure have been ignored in epidemiological studies. The effect of using dose, pattern and timing of consumption ("composite" method) was investigated in this study, to examine the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal effects. Methods The composite method resulted in six categories of exposure (abstinent, low, moderate, binge < weekly, binge 1-2x/week and heavy). The odds of language delay and child behaviour problems were calculated for the composite method and then compared with an analysis using averaged estimates of <1 and 1 + drinks per day and with stratification by quantity ignoring dose per occasion. Data used for the analyses were from a 10% random sample of non-Indigenous women delivering a live infant in Western Australia (1995-1997). Participants from the 1995-1996 cohort were invited to participate in an 8-year longitudinal survey (78% response rate n=2224; 85% were followedup at 2 years, 73% at 5 years and 61% at 8 years). Results The effect of moderate and binge levels of exposure was only evident with the composite method; anxiety/depression following first-trimester moderate exposure (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.34), and following late pregnancy moderate (aggressive behaviour OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.09) and binge (language delay OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 9.93) exposures. Results for heavy levels of exposure were similar with each method. The estimates for late pregnancy were imprecise due to small numbers. Conclusion The composite method of classification more closely reflects real-life drinking patterns and better discriminates maternal drinking than the other methods, particularly low, moderate and binge levels.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure leads to widespread cognitive deficits, including problems with spatial working memory (SWM). Neuroimaging studies report structural and functional abnormalities in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), but interpretations may be complicated by the co-occurrence of a family history of alcoholism. Since this history is also linked to cognitive deficits and brain abnormalities, it is difficult to determine the extent to which deficits are unique to prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Age-matched subjects selected from 2 neuroimaging studies underwent functional imaging while engaging in a task assessing memory for spatial locations relative to a vigilance condition assessing attention. Pairwise comparisons were made for the following 3 groups: children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 18); those with no prenatal alcohol exposure, but a confirmed family history of alcoholism (FHP, n = 18); and nonexposed, family history negative controls (CON, n = 17). Results: Relative to CON and FHP, the ALC group showed increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left middle and superior frontal gyri for the SWM condition relative to the vigilance condition (SWM contrast). Additionally, the ALC group showed unique BOLD response increases in the left lingual gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus relative to CON, and left cuneus and precuneus relative to FHP. Both ALC and FHP showed greater activation compared to CON in the lentiform nucleus and insular region. Conclusions: These results confirm previous studies suggesting SWM deficits in FASD. Differences between the ALC group and the CON and FHP groups suggest the left middle and superior frontal region may be specifically affected in alcohol-exposed children. Conversely, differences from the CON group in the lentiform nucleus and insular region for the ALC and FHP groups may indicate this region is associated with family history of alcoholism rather than specifically with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol affects 1 in 100 births in the United States resulting in neurodevelopmental and learning abnormalities. Development of the nervous system, including myelination and differentiation, are dependent on soluble and membrane bound receptors. Alterations in these may underlie abnormal development due to in-utero alcohol exposure. Prenatal therapy with neuropeptides (NAP + SAL) prevents some of the developmental and behavioral abnormalities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of alcohol and NAP + SAL in cellular signaling pathways. STUDY DESIGN: We used the well characterized Webster mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnancy was identified by vaginal plug and treatment with alcohol (0.03mL/kg IP), alcohol+NAP+SAL (20fxg IP) or control (saline) was administered on gestational day 8. Embryos were harvested after 30 minutes, 60 minutes or 10 days. MAP kinase, SRC and STAT cell signaling pathways were studied using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Milli-pore) and normalized to total protein concentration. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with Fishers post hoc for multiple comparisons; P<.05 significant. RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol increased phosphorylation of JNK in the embryo at 30 and 60min compared with controls (both P<0.01). Pretreatment with NAP+SAL returned levels to control at 60min (Figure). Similarly alcohol increased phosphorylation ofp38 at 30min and NAP + SAL returned levels to control. These findings persisted at 10 days. No differences were found in the phosphorylation of ERK. The levels at these timepoints were undetectable for the SRC and STAT pathways. CONCLUSION: Phosphorylation of the JNK andp38 cell signaling pathways are affected by alcohol exposure in pregnancy. Targeting cell signaling pathways, such as with NAP+SAL, should have a significant impact on prevention of alcohol-induced abnormalities. (Graph Presented).

N2  - The relationship between maternal drinking during pregnancy and low birth weight and birth defects is expressed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the corresponding studies have not been conducted in Japan. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of alcohol and tobacco use by both mothers and fathers on the development of newborn babies and infants in Japan. This study was conducted in Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan, with collaboration with all municipal health centers in the city. The questionnaires were delivered to all parents present at health checkups for their four-month old infants, and replies were returned by post. The questionnaire included questions about infants at birth and at four months of age, related to development status, weight and height, and it also included questions about parents, related to age, physical condition, flushing history, medical history, smoking history, passive smoking, and drinking patterns before and after pregnancy ( drinking patterns of fathers were examined only before pregnancy ). Total number of replies was 3,689 of 30,600 subjects and 27 subjects were excluded due to multiple births. Compared with the national average, the average birth weight and height of our subjects were almost the same, and the physiques of the infants were related with the number of pregnancies and births, period of gestation and parents' height and weight. The maternal smoking rate was 18.3% (prepregnancy), 7.0% (less than 16 weeks of pregnancy) and 4.9%( more than 16 weeks of pregnancy). The corresponding rates of maternal drinking were 59.4%, 25.3% and 15.7%. Paternal drinking and smoking were not related to the development of newborn infants and babies. Maternal smoking history during pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights. Infants delivered by mothers who had drunk daily during pregnancy tended to show low birth weights, but it was not significant. However, maternal heavy drinking after 16 weeks of pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights, small heads, even after correction of parents' age and height, number of pregnancies and period of gestation, and maternal smoking history. Smoking and heavy drinking by mothers may disturb the development of infants of general population in Japan.

N2  - Background: Recent studies have shown significant white matter abnormalities in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is capable of identifying subtle microstructural abnormalities in white matter - including in the absence of gross structural anomalies. Our previous work has revealed that corpus callosum abnormalities in FASD are associated with measurable disturbances in inter-hemispheric functional connectivity. The current study extends these findings in an examination of whole-brain functional connectivity using graph-theory analysis of resting fMRI data. Methods: High resolution anatomical, 30-direction DTI, and 6-minute eyes-closed restingstate fMRI data were obtained on a Siemens Tim Trio 3T scanner from 24 children (ages 10-17) with FASD and 31 matched control subjects. All children were evaluated and diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician using the University of Washington 4-digit diagnostic system. Neurocognitive evaluations, including the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WISC-IV / WAIS-IV), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT / CVLT-C) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) were also obtained. MRI data were pre-processed with the 1000-functional-connectome protocol. fMRI data were subjected to regression against whole-brain signal, white matter, CSF, and motion. Susceptibility artifacts in the fMRI data were corrected with field maps. Anatomical data were parsed with FreeSurfer and ROIs were applied to the fMRI data. The matrix of correlations of resting fMRI signal from 60 cortical ROIs was examined with graph theory analyses. Results: Overall network efficiency was significantly lower in FASD vs. controls as evidenced by higher mean path length in FASD (p=.038) and lower global efficiency (p=.042) in FASD. There were also trend-level indications of abnormalities in localized processing including higher mean clustering coefficient (p=.066) and higher local efficiency (p=.096) in FASD. None of the four network indices was correlated with IQ, but significant correlations were observed between path length and global executive functioning on the BRIEF (r=.41, p = .048). Global efficiency and path length were also correlated to initial learning (trial 1) on the CVLT. Conclusions: The results from this study of whole-brain functional connectivity are consistent with previous studies, including our own, that suggest significant abnormities in brain networks among children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Measures of network function were found to correlate significantly with cognitive functioning including memory and executive control. Whole-brain functional connectivity measures have the potential to serve as an index of level of functional brain impairment and also to serve as measures of change - change over development and change with intervention.

N2  - Neurons containing proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptides, known to control stress axis, metabolic and immune functions, have a lower function in patients with a family history of alcoholism, raising the possibility that alcohol effects on the POMC system may transmit through generations. In this study we investigated whether prenatal ethanol alters DNA methylation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, and also whether the methylation changes in the proximal POMC promoter can be transmitted transgenerationally. The rat POMC gene contains a 5' CpG island that surrounds the POMC transcription start site. Detailed characterization of POMC DNA methylation revealed that there were fetal alcohol-induced changes in methylation that resulted in hypermethylation of proximal POMC promoter in adulthood, even though the exposure to ethanol ended at GD 21. A transgenerational study was conducted by mating male and female rats (F1) prenatally exposed to alcohol or a control diet for three generations. The proximal POMC promoter in the F1 and F2 animals was significantly hypermethylated in comparison to the control group, and the POMC gene expression level was decreased in both male and female progenies. However, in the F3 generation only male offspring of the exposed animals demonstrated a significant increase in DNA methylation level with the concomitant drop in POMC gene expression. Additionally, hypermethylated POMC gene was detected in sperm of fetal alcohol exposed F1 through F3 male germline. The germline transmission of POMC gene methylation was also correlated with altered stress axis response. Thus, our data highlight the novel possibility that epigenetic changes contribute to the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on POMC gene expression, as well as, the perpetuation of abnormal POMC neuronal functions through subsequent generations via the male, possibly through Y-chromosome. The results also shed light on the sexdependent difference in the genetic risk of alcohol dependence.

N2  - Purpose : Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders refers to a constellation of physical, psychological and emotional deficits that affect children of mothers who used alcohol during pregnancy, the most serious of which is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, or FAS. Although, Asian countries were known to have lower prevalence of alcohol drinking and alcohol dependence, currently those among women has been increasing very fast. In Korea, the rate of past month drinking among women has been increasing from 32% to 80%(1989 - 2007). This trend was prominent especially in childbearing age group. Therefore, it was expected that there might be substantial risk of development of FASD in Korea. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of FASD in Korea. Method : We used active case ascertainment approach to raise the possibility of detecting FASD case. We visited 8 institutes where the kids with mental retardation were committed and 13 general elimentary school. In primary screening process, 307 kids were screened by height and weight. 97 Kids whose height or weight are under 10 percentile were selected for facial dysmorphologic examination in institution. In addition, in general school setting, 7,785 kids were screened, and dysmorphologic examination were performed in 231 kids. Results : Among kids in instiution 13 kids(14%) were diagnosed by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, while 40(43%) kids were found to be group with deferred diagnosed by FAS. Further among kids in general school, 40 kids(0.51%) were diagnosed by FAS according to dysmorphology core criteria by CIFASD, while 14 kids(0.18%) were diagnosed by FAS according to Canaidian diagnosis guidelines. Conclusion : In conclusion, as we used active case ascertainment approach to higher risk group and general population, we could find the relatively higher rate of FAS. In order to estimate the general prevalence of FASD, the expanded epidemiologic survey on FASD in general population and alcohol exposure in perinatal clinic are needed.

N2  - Purpose of the Study: The relationship between maternal drinking during pregnancy and low birth weight and birth defects is expressed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the corresponding studies have not been conducted in Japan. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of alcohol and tobacco use by both mothers and fathers on the development of newborn babies and infants in Japan. Method: This study was conducted in Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan, with collaboration with all municipal health centers in the city. The questionnaires were delivered to all parents present at health checkups for their four-month old infants, and replies were returned by post. The questionnaire included questions about infants at birth and at four months of age, related to development status, weight and height, and it also included questions about parents, related to age, physical condition, flushing history, medical history, smoking history, passive smoking, and drinking patterns before and after pregnancy ( drinking patterns of fathers were examined only before pregnancy ). Results: Total number of replies was 3,689 of 30,600 subjects and 27 subjects were excluded due to multiple births. Compared with the national average, the average birth weight and height of our subjects were almost the same, and the physiques of the infants were related with the number of pregnancies and births, period of gestation and parents' height and weight. The maternal smoking rate was 18.3% (prepregnancy), 7.0% (less than 16 weeks of pregnancy) and 4.9%( more than 16 weeks of pregnancy). The corresponding rates of maternal drinking were 59.4%, 25.3% and 15.7%. Paternal drinking and smoking were not related to the development of newborn infants and babies. Maternal smoking history during pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights. Infants delivered by mothers who had drunk daily during pregnancy tended to show low birth weights, but it was not significant. However, maternal heavy drinking after 16 weeks of pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights, small heads, even after correction of parents' age and height, number of pregnancies and period of gestation, and maternal smoking history. Conclusion: Smoking and heavy drinking by mothers may disturb the development of infants of general population in Japan.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the most debilitating outcome of an alcoholexposed pregnancy (AEP) associated with heavy maternal drinking; alcohol consumption at lower levels can result in a range of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). No safe amount of alcohol or time during pregnancy has been identified, including early in pregnancy when a woman may not know she is pregnant. A combination of at-risk drinking with the possibility of becoming pregnant constitutes significant risk for AEP. The risk is prevalent among Russian women and developing OBGYN clinic-based brief interventions (BI) that target both risky alcohol consumption and lack of contraception is promising for preventing FASD. Methods: This study is a two-arm, site-randomized clinical trial testing a BI designed to reduce the AEP risk among childbearing age women. Women were recruited for the study at 20 district OBGYN clinics in two locations, representing a major urban population of St. Petersburg (SPB) and a more rural population of the Nizhny Novgorod Region (NNR). Clinics were randomized to intervention or control/services as usual conditions. The intervention was based on BI guidelines (Barbor & Higgins-Biddle, 1992; Whitlock et al. 2004) and evidence-based FASD prevention interventions, Healthy Moms (Fleming et al., 2008) and Project CHOICES (Floyd et al., 2007). The dual-focused brief physician intervention (DFBPI) was designed to be deliverable by OBGYN physicians at women's clinics. The intervention consisted of two face-to-face, structured, 5-minute sessions incorporated in clinic visits scheduled approximately one month apart. Follow-up assessments were at 3, 6, and 12-months. A total of 1,914 childbearing age women were screened and women at risk for AEP,( i.e., had intercourse without effective contraception and consumed four or more drinks on any occasion or eight or more than drinks per week) were recruited for the study (n=764), including 404 women at-risk in SPB and 360 in NNR. Results: Binge drinking was prevalent among women at both study locations; NNR women reported less effective contraceptive use. Physicians incorporated the intervention into clinic visits and maintained intervention skills. Preliminary findings: Both groups reduced alcohol consumption- 68% in the intervention group and 64% in control group at 3 month follow-up. Compared to the control group, larger proportions of women in the intervention condition reported reduced alcohol consumption at 6 month (71% vs 61%) and 12 month follow up (69 vs 56%). Conclusions: Results support the feasibility of the DFBPI at OBGYN clinics in Russia.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to induce fetal brain growth deficits at different embryonic stages. We focused this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects against alcohol-induced apoptosis at midgestation using activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF)-9, a peptide (SALLRSIPA) derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor, and NAP, a peptide (NAPVSIPQ) derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein. We used an established fetal alcohol exposure mouse model. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet (ALC) group with 25 % (4.49 %, v/v) ethanol-derived calories, (2) pair-fed (PF) control group, (3) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9) group, (4) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of NAP (ALC/NAP) group, (5) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of ADNF-9 (PF/ADNF-9) group, and (6) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of NAP (PF/NAP) group. On day 15 (E15), fetal brains were collected, weighed, and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. ADNF-9 or NAP was administered daily from E7 to E15 alongside PF or ALC liquid diet exposure. Our results show that NAP and ADNF-9 significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of fetal brains. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP or ADNF-9 administration alongside alcohol exposure significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium of the cingulate cortex and ganglionic eminence. These findings may pave the path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during pregnancy stages. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Objective: In humans, antenatal alcohol exposure elicits various developmental disorders, in particular in the brain. Numerous studies focus on the deleterious effects of alcohol on neural cells. Although recent studies suggest that alcohol can affect angiogenesis in adults, the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain microvasculature remains poorly understood. Methods: We used a mouse model to investigate effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the cortical microvascular network in vivo and ex vivo and the action of alcohol, glutamate, and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) on activity, plasticity, and survival of microvessels. We used quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, calcimetry, and videomicroscopy. We characterized the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the cortical microvascular network in human controls and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (pFAS) patients at different developmental stages. Results: In mice, prenatal alcohol exposure induced a reduction of cortical vascular density, loss of the radial orientation of microvessels, and altered expression of VEGF receptors. Time-lapse experiments performed on brain slices revealed that ethanol inhibited glutamate-induced calcium mobilization in endothelial cells, affected plasticity, and promoted death of microvessels. These effects were prevented by VEGF. In humans, we evidenced a stage-dependent alteration of the vascular network in the cortices of fetuses with pFAS/FAS. Whereas no modification was observed from gestational week 20 (WG20) to WG22, the radial organization of cortical microvessels was clearly altered in pFAS/FAS patients from WG30 to WG38. Interpretation: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects cortical angiogenesis both in mice and in pFAS/FAS patients, suggesting that vascular defects contribute to alcohol-induced brain abnormalities.

N2  - Studies in rat models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders have indicated that the cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to ethanol-induced Purkinje cell loss during the third trimester-equivalent, with striking regional differences in vulnerability in which early-maturing regions in the vermis show significantly more loss than the late-maturing regions. The current study tested the hypothesis that the sheep model will show similar regional differences in fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell loss when prenatal binge ethanol exposure is restricted to the prenatal period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester and also compared the pattern of loss to that produced by exposure during the first trimester-equivalent. Pregnant Suffolk sheep were assigned to four groups: first trimester-equivalent saline control group, first trimester-equivalent ethanol group (1.75. g/kg/day), third trimester-equivalent saline control group, and third trimester-equivalent ethanol group (1.75. g/kg/day). Ethanol was administered as an intravenous infusion on 3 consecutive days followed by a 4-day ethanol-free interval, to mimic a weekend binge drinking pattern. Animals from all four groups were sacrificed and fetal brains were harvested on gestation day 133. Fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell counts were performed in an early-maturing region (lobules I-X) and a late-maturing region (lobules VIc-VII) from mid-sagittal sections of the cerebellar vermis. As predicted, the third trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure caused a significant reduction in the fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell volume density and Purkinje cell number in the early-maturing region, but not in the late-maturing region. In contrast, the first trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure resulted in significant reductions in both the early and late-maturing regions. These data confirmed that the previous findings in rat models that third trimester-equivalent prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in regionally-specific Purkinje cell loss in the early-maturing region of the vermis, and further demonstrated that first trimester ethanol exposure caused more generalized fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, independent of the cerebellar vermal region. These findings support the idea that prenatal ethanol exposure in the first trimester interferes with the genesis of Purkinje cells in an unselective manner, whereas exposure during the third trimester selectively kills post-mitotic Purkinje cells in specific vermal regions during a vulnerable period of differentiation and synaptogenesis. © 2012.

N2  - Background Alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) falls under the umbrella of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), but individuals do not demonstrate the facial characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), making diagnosis difficult. While attentional problems in ARND are similar to those found in attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the underlying impairment in attention pathways may be different. Methods Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a working memory (1-back) task of 63 children, 10 to 14 years old, diagnosed with ARND and ADHD, as well as typically developing (TD) controls, was conducted at 3 T. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were also acquired. Results Activations were observed in posterior parietal and occipital regions in the TD group and in dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal regions in the ARND group, whereas the ADHD group activated only dorsolateral prefrontal regions, during the working memory component of the task (1-back minus 0-back contrast). The increases in frontal and parietal activity were significantly greater in the ARND group compared to the other groups. This increased activity was associated with reduced accuracy and increased response time variability, suggesting that ARND subjects exert greater effort to manage short-term memory load. Significantly greater intra-subject variability, demonstrated by fMRI region-of-interest analysis, in the ADHD and ARND groups compared to the TD group suggests that momentto- moment lapses in attention contributed to their poorer task performance. Differences in functional activity in ARND subjects with and without a diagnosis of ADHD resulted primarily from reduced activation by the ARND/ADHD + group during the 0-back task. In contrast, children with ADHD alone clearly showed reduced activations during the 1-back task. DTI analysis revealed that the TD group had significantly higher total tract volume and number of fibers than the ARND group. These measures were negatively correlated with errors on the 1-back task, suggesting a link between white matter integrity and task performance. Conclusions fMRI activations suggest that the similar behavior of children with ARND and ADHD on a spatial working memory task is the result of different cognitive events. The nature of ADHD in children with ARND appears to differ from that of children with ADHD alone. © 2012 Malisza et al.

N2  - Background: A derived peptide from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) has been shown to be neuroprotective in the fetal alcohol exposure model. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 against alcohol-induced apoptosis using TUNEL staining. We further characterize in this study the proteomic architecture underlying the role of ADNF-9 against ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Methods. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic days 7-13 (E7-E13) to a 25% ethanol-derived calorie [25% EDC, Alcohol (ALC)] diet, a 25% EDC diet simultaneously administered i.p. ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9), or a pair-fed (PF) liquid diet. At E13, fetal brains were collected from 5 dams from each group, weighed, and frozen for LC-MS/MS procedure. Other fetal brains were fixed for TUNEL staining. Results: Administration of ADNF-9 prevented alcohol-induced reduction in fetal brain weight and alcohol-induced increases in cell death. Moreover, individual fetal brains were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Statistical differences in the amounts of proteins between the ALC and ALC/ADNF-9 groups resulted in a distinct data-clustering. Significant upregulation of several important proteins involved in brain development were found in the ALC/ADNF-9 group as compared to the ALC group. Conclusion: These findings provide information on potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 in the fetal alcohol exposure model. © 2011 Sari et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Studies of the adverse neurobehavioral effects of maternal alcohol consumption on the fetus have been largely confined to the postnatal period, after exposure to alcohol has finished. This study explored the brain function of the fetus, at the time of exposure to alcohol, to examine its effect on information processing and stability of performance. Methods: Five groups of fetuses, defined by maternal alcohol consumption patterns, were examined: control (no alcohol); moderate (5 to 10 units/wk either drunk evenly across the week or as a binge, in 2 to 3 days); heavy (20+ units/wk drunk evenly or as a binge). Fetal habituation performance was examined on 3 occasions, separated by 7 days, beginning at 35 weeks of gestation. The number of trials required to habituate on each test session and the difference in performance across test sessions were recorded. Results: Fetuses exposed to heavy binge drinking required significantly more trials to habituate and exhibited a greater variability in performance across all test sessions than the other groups. Maternal drinking, either heavily but evenly or moderately as a binge, resulted in poorer habituation, and moderate binge drinking resulted in greater variability compared with no, or even, drinking. Conclusions: Decreased information processing, reflected by poorer habituation, and increased variability in performance may reflect the initial manifestations of structural damage caused by alcohol to the brain. These results will lead to a greater understanding of the effects of alcohol on the fetus's brain, enable the antenatal identification of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and lead to the early implementation of better management strategies. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Introduction: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has been identified as significant medical and public health problem. Many studies have reported morphologic characteristics and long-term disabilities. However neurodevelopment of early infancy has been rarely described. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Cheil General Hospital Mother Risk Program. In total 236 pregnant women participated in the research and filled out TWEAK questionnaire. After delivery and 12 months postpartum, offspring5 were examined and mothers were interviewed. Meconium was collected to measure fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) in their offspring5. 106 babies being over 10 months of age were performed the physically examined and Bayley scales of infant and Toddler Development III (BSID-III) were performed. We compared the growth (height, weight, and head circumference), morphological characteristics (palpebral fissure length and philtrum grade) and BSID-III results between maternal alcohol drinking group and non-drinking group. Results: The overall rate of alcohol drinking more than once during pregnancy was 55% (66/120). In maternal alcohol drinking group, TWEAK positive rate was 38% (25/66) and FAEE positive rate was 24% (8/33). One child was diagnosed as foetal alcohol syndrome. For the growth, children in the maternal alcohol drinking group showed less growth rate, shorter palpebral fissure length, higher philtrum grade and lower BSID-III score than in the nondrinking group however statistical difference was not significant. Conclusion: Offspring of women drinking alcohol had tendency of delayed neurodevelopment but that was not prominent in early infancy. Development test alone could not be a diagnostic tool for FASD without distinctive FAS morphology.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The indications of brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in fetal alcohol syndrome are not clearly defined, even though the condition is recognized as one of the most common causes of mental retardation. This article reports a case of a 9-year-old adopted girl with developmental delay, mildly dysmorphic facial features, and behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. Extensive investigations including genetic studies and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormalities, and a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome was considered since official diagnostic criteria were met. A brain SPECT was requested and showed severely decreased tracer activity in the thalami, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes on both sides, the overall findings being consistent with the established diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. With increasing availability of functional brain imaging, the study indications and possible ethical implications in suspected prenatal alcohol exposure or even before adoption need further consideration. In this patient, SPECT was the only test to yield positive results. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - We have previously reported that prenatal alcohol exposure(PAE) could lead to intrauterine growth retardation(IUGR), and the offspring developed dysfunction of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as well as disorder of glucose/lipid metabolism in their adulthood. However, whether PAE can predispose the IUGR offspring to fatty liver disease (FLD) during adulthood in a sex-specific manner is still unknown. Present study was to demonstrate the susceptibilities of IUGR offspring caused by PAE to adult FLD induced by a high-fat diet in a sex-specific manner, and to investigate the potential mechanisms. Pregnant Wistar rats were ingested ethanol 4 g/kg d from gestational day (GD) 11 to 20, and the control received vehicle. Litters of each group were culled to 8 according to the standard of IUGR at birth. At 3 wk, all pups were weaned onto a high-fat (HF) (45% kcal from fat) diet to induce hepatosteatosis. Animals were weighed every 2 wk and anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed by decapitation at 24 wks. Tissues were dissected, weighed, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 degreeC for the subsequent use. Serum IGF1 and glucocorticoid were measured by ELISA, serum insulin by radioimmunoassay, serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-c and HDL-c by biochemical assays. The pathological change of liver was examined by HE stain, and FLD was evaluated by klenier score. The mRNA expressions of key genes of IGF1 signal pathway and lipid metabolism were assessed by Real-time PCR. The results showed: 1 Compared with control, the birth weights of pups of PAE group were obviously decreased(P<0.01) and the gain rates of body weight were also increased, while the female showed approximate food take but increased body temperature ( p < 0.01). 2 Serum glucocorticoid and IGF1 level of female were significantly increased(p<0.01), but not males. The serum insulin levels of all offspring had decreased tendency. The serum glucose was significantly increased in female (p<0.01), resulting in the increased insulin sensibility index (p<0.05). The serum LDL-c levels of all offspring were increased(p<0.05), but not HDL-c. 3 The amount of lipid droplets of PAE group were greater than that of control, and the klneiner score showed a significant increase in PAE female group(p<0.01). 4 The liver gene expression. In PAE female group, the IGF1 pathway(IGF-1, IGF-1R, IRS2 and GLUT2) and lipogenesis genes(SREBP1c, CHREBP, ACC and FASN) were significantly up-regulated(p<0.01, p<0.05), while the genes related to TG transport and  oxidation(CPT1a, MTTP) were unchanged or even decreased. All male offspring remained unchanged. Those results demonstrated that the IUGR female offspring of PAE group develop a catch-up growth pattern and obviously FLD in adulthood, and the corresponding mechanisms may lie in a high level of serum glucocorticoid and IGF1 mediated liver glucose/lipid metabolic disorder.

N2  - Objective: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these alterations. Study Design: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after 6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P <.05 considered significant. Results: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9; range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P <.003), similar to the controls. Alcohol exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (P <.003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1beta were decreased 6 hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-, and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of the groups. Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Background: Observational studies have generated conflicting evidence on the effects of moderate maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy on offspring cognition mainly reflecting problems of confounding. Among mothers who drink during pregnancy fetal alcohol exposure is influenced not only by mother's intake but also by genetic variants carried by both the mother and the fetus. Associations between children's cognitive function and both maternal and child genotype at these loci can shed light on the effects of maternal alcohol consumption on offspring cognitive development. Methods: We used a large population based study of women recruited during pregnancy to determine whether genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes in this cohort of women and their children were related to the child's cognitive score (measured by the Weschler Intelligence Scale) at age 8. Findings: We found that four genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes in 4167 children were strongly related to lower IQ at age 8, as was a risk allele score based on these 4 variants. This effect was only seen amongst the offspring of mothers who were moderate drinkers (1-6 units alcohol per week during pregnancy (per allele effect estimates were -1.80 (95% CI = -2.63 to -0.97) p = 0.00002, with no effect among children whose mothers abstained during pregnancy (0.16 (95%CI = -1.05 to 1.36) p = 0.80), p-value for interaction = 0.009). A further genetic variant associated with alcohol metabolism in mothers was associated with their child's IQ, but again only among mothers who drank during pregnancy. © 2012 Lewis et al.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Objective: To determine to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta. Methods: Placentae (n=4) from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto were taken to the on-site perfusion laboratory. After cannulation and establishment of dual circulation, 1 mcg/mL EtG was added to the maternal reservoir and samples were taken throughout the 3h experiment. Measurements of placental viability were oxygen transfer, pH, glucose consumption, hCG production, fetal reservoir volume, and fetal arterial inflow pressure. EtG was analyzed in perfusate samples and placental tissue by GC-MS after solid phase extraction. Results: After 3h, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 0.30 +/- 0.02 and net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring. Triplicate averages of EtG concentrations in perfused placental lobules ranged from 140-414 ng/g. Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all perfusions. Conclusions: EtG appears to cross the human placenta and, hence, to represent both maternal and fetal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) are both validated biomarkers of chronic excessive alcohol consumption in hair. One of the most promising clinical applications of alcohol hair analysis is to identify infants as risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) by assessing maternal ethanol consumption; however, studies on FAEE and EtG hair analysis to determine alcohol abuse have been primarily conducted in male populations. Previous studies have indicated that the use of ethanol containing hair-care products may elevate FAEE concentrations in hair, providing a potential source of bias in the use of this biomarker in female populations. This study examines individuals undergoing hair analysis under suspicion of chronic alcohol abuse in child safety investigations. METHODS: A total of 207 hair specimens were analyzed for both FAEE and EtG, approximately 70% of all samples were from female donors. Onehundred fifty-eight samples were blindly assessed for both biomarkers; n = 49 additional samples were analyzed for EtG following positive FAEE analysis. Cut-off values of 0.50 ng/mg-FAEE and 25 pg/mg-EtG were applied to determine chronic excessive alcohol consumption. Hair samples were pre-washed to remove external contamination and analyzed for FAEE and EtG by GC-MS using deuterated internal standards. RESULTS: A higher rate of correspondence was found between FAEE and EtG levels amongst male (71%) over female (28%) subjects. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a gender bias exists making determination of chronic excessive alcohol use challenging in female subjects. The source of this bias is likely cosmetic hair treatments; with ethanol-containing hair products producing false-positive FAEE findings and hair bleaching/colouring possibly producing falsenegative EtG results contributing to a greater discordance amongst samples of female origin.

N2  - Background: The need for FASD assessment and diagnostic services is high in justice settings where rates of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) appear prevalent. However, diagnostic capacity and resources are scarce, underscoring the need for valid screening tools to identify individuals appropriate for complete assessments. Objective: To assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the Asante FASD Screening and Referral Tool (AST) in justice involved youth. Method: The AST was completed for 100 justiceinvolved youth ages 12 - 23 (M = 17.53, SD = 1.59, 81.0% male), 50 with an FASD diagnosis and 50 without PAE, by unblinded raters. Sensitivity and specificity coefficients were calculated according to the AST referral algorithm (one social factor plus > two personal factors, or, no social factors plus > three personal factors). Results: Of the 50 youth diagnosed with FASD, 46 screened positive for further assessment using the AST referral decision tree, while 15 youth without PAE screened positive. Sensitivity and specificity values for the AST were 92% (CI .80 - .97) and 70% (.55 - .82), respectively, producing a positive predictive value of .75 (CI .62 - .85), negative predictive value of .90 (CI .75 - .97), false positive rate of .25 (CI .15 - .38), and false negative rate of .10 (CI .03 - .25). Conclusions: Overall, findings suggest the AST showed strong clinical utility in identifying youth with a confirmed diagnosis of FASD. Results support the need for further efforts to validate the AST prospectively using full assessments following screening.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Although receiving services for developmental disabilities is a strong protective factor against negative outcomes in FASD, there is little research on service utilization patterns among individuals with FASD. The goal of the current study was to examine rates of service utilization among children with FASD and those with confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) without an FASD diagnosis. Service utilization patterns were compared across diagnostic group, diagnostic assessment before age six vs. after age six, and residential location (urban vs. rural). Methods: Caregivers of 46 children with FASD and 26 with PAE were interviewed using the Services for Children and Adolescents Parent Interview (SCAPI). The SCAPI collects information about child medication, individual child therapy, parent/family therapy, education services, parenting classes/groups, and parent medication. Questions about respite and early intervention were added. Results: The most frequently used services among both diagnostic groups were education services, child medication, child therapy, and parenting classes. The groups differed in access to educational support (accessed more by FASD) and parenting classes/groups (accessed more by PAE). Children assessed before age 6 had better service access than those diagnosed later in areas of early intervention, parent/family therapy, and parent medication whereas a greater proportion of those diagnosed after age 6 accessed respite. Service access did not differ between urban and rural participants. Conclusions: An FASD diagnosis instead of just confirmed PAE does not generally seem to increase overall rates of service utilization. Furthermore, geographic location has little effect on service utilization. However, being diagnosed before age six appears to be associated with better service access.

N2  - Objectives: The majority of studies investigating possible long-term effects of a prenatal exposure to alcohol define alcohol exposure solely on the basis of first trimester intake. The present study aimed 1. to investigate possible effects of using exposure information from three trimester interviews and prepregnancy intake rather than only using exposure information from early part of pregnancy; and 2. to compare possible trends in background characteristics between exposure groups with trends in estimates of multivariable linear and logistic regressions between alcohol exposure and behavioural scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) controlling for a large number of confounders. Materials & Methods: Sample: The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), comprising information on 100.000 pregnant women and their offspring. Alcohol consumption in first trimester: grouped 0, >0-2, >2-4, >4+ alcohol containing units/ week. Alcohol consumption pre-pregnancy and during entire pregnancy: grouped 0, >0-5, >5-15, >15-45, >45-90, >90+ cumulated alcohol exposure. Outcome measures: 1) Descriptive measures on background characteristics including demographic and lifestyle factors deriving from either registries or self-reports. 2) SDQ continuous scores for use in linear regression and above cut-off SDQ scores for use in logistic regressions. Results (preliminary): 1). Abstainers defined on the basis of full pregnancy information were more extreme (in either direction) compared to the abstainers defined from first trimester. Reversely, the high exposure group defined from first trimester scores more extreme on a large number of parameters compared to the high intakers defined from full pregnancy information. 2) No effects of alcohol were observed in the multivariable linear and logistic regressions with SDQ outcomes. However, the trends in estimates from the regressions for the two groups resembled the trends observed for the key variables for the two groups in the background characteristics tables. Conclusion (preliminary): The study shows the immense impact classification of alcohol groups have on the observed results. Although studies may control for relevant confounders there seem to be immense amounts of residual confounding that that is not possible to control for. This may seriously affect the results to such a degree that possible true effects of prenatal exposure to small to moderate amounts of alcohol on behavioural outcome is not detectable. The findings question whether this type of epidemiological design is at all appropriate to investigate the association between small exposures and outcomes later in life. The finding may also explain the alcohol jshape curve that has puzzled researchers for years.

N2  - Objectives: As part of population-based prevalence study of FASD in the Lazio Province of Italy, researchers conducted in-depth maternal interviews with mothers of all cohort subjects (n=976). The objective was to examine and better define the maternal risk factors of the mothers who produce children with an FASD. Materials & Methods: Lazio contains the city of Rome and the study area is characterized by small and medium sized towns and rural areas. The study consisted of two waves of dysmorphology screening, child testing, and interviews of mothers all with affected children and controls from first grade classes and their mothers. Results: Analysis of the maternal demographic and drinking characteristics of mothers of children with FASD, mothers of randomly-selected controls, and community mothers of other first grade children provided many statistically significant results including height and body mass index (BMI) differences, with mothers of the FASD children being the shortest (F = 5.95, p =.003), and having the highest BMI (F = 3.45, p = .032). Mothers of FASD children report the highest lifetime alcohol consumption (X2 = 7.85, p = .020), as well as more drinks consumed per month (F = 10.72, p = .000), and in the past week (F = 8.27, p = .000) at the time of interview. In addition, total drinks consumed per week three months before pregnancy is significantly higher for mothers of children with FASD (F = 5.03, p = .007), as is the percentage of that group who report consuming three drinks or more per occasion during pregnancy (e.g., binge drinking; X2 = 5.70, p = .058). Correlations illustrate the importance of maternal demographic (e.g., mother's occupation and monthly income) and other drinking variables (e.g., variety of alcohol types consumed, total number drinks consumed per week three months before pregnancy, binge drinking), as they correlate significantly with child physical traits that are key to FASD diagnoses, In addition, paternal and family variables are examined, including reported alcohol problems in the child's family and father's legal problems, both of which differ significantly by group (FASD, Control, and Community; X2 = 11.74, p = .003 and X2 = 8.03, p = .018, respectively), with the greatest problems in the FASD group. Conclusion: Maternal risk factors for FASD in Italy have been better defined by this study, and the results may be relevant to other European countries.

N2  - Introduction: Ethanol consumption by pregnant women can produce severe effects in the foetus and the newborn, mainly in neurological and weight-height development, and are included in the term FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder). Questionnaires are the most used screening method to detect prenatal exposure, but a previous population study questioned its reliability. The objective of this study was to compare alcohol prenatal exposure detection by questionnaire compared with biomarkers in meconium. Materials & Methods: Sixty two meconium samples from mothers who denied alcohol consumption during pregnancy by questionnaire were analysed. The objective analysis was made by determination of FAEEs (fatty acid ethyl esters) as exposure biomarkers in meconium as biological matrix. Results: In the meconium from 10 of 62 newborns from non-alcohol consuming mothers by questionnaire (16.12%) FAEE values were positive (> 2 nmol/g). Discussion: Questionnaires as a screening method during pregnancy are not a reliable tool. It is necessary to identify prenatal exposure to alcohol as soon as possible by biomarkers analysis in biological matrices from the newborn or the mother. The early detection will allow these patients to benefit from follow up and treatment to reach the best possible neurological development.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this systematic report was to review the literature regarding the attachment styles of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Materials & Methods: AMED, BNI, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, Pubmed Central, and Science Direct were systematically searched using various FASD (FASD, PAE , FAS, FAE) terminologies alongside the keyword of attachment. Papers were also checked manually against records. Results: The systematic searches yielded a mere eight articles and two dissertation abstracts dated from 1987 to 2009. Only two articles were found that addressed a specific FASD condition; which reported no effects upon the child's attachment. Five studies argued for an association between prenatal alcohol exposure and insecurity of attachment in offspring, one reported infrequent effects of alcohol on attachment, whereas the remaining two found no significant relationship; with one article contesting that any differences in attachment may be explained by low-quality care instead. All of the articles suffered from methodological issues including sample size, choice of measures and control of confounding variables; however the specific variable of intellectual functioning, which is commonly damaged within suffers of FASD, was not appropriately considered. Studies into attachment within children diagnosed with disorders that are frequently co-morbid with FASD, such as ADHD and ASD, may help to shed the light on the effects of FASD. Conclusions: With many children born to alcohol addicted mothers being taken into care or experiencing neglect the lack of research and high prevalence within this group of neurodevelopmental disorders, further research is required to understand attachment styles in children with FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Early diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is essential for the prevention of secondary problems. There are, however, strong indications that many children and adults with FASD go unrecognized and are untreated. In addition, some individuals with FASD are incorrectly diagnosed and receive the wrong treatment. This pilot study investigates to what degree FASD related behavior problems are present in children in foster care in The Netherlands. Materials & Methods: Approximately 270 Dutch foster parents will be approached to participate in our study. Data will be collected for children, aged 6 to 16, who have been in their current foster family for over 6 months. Foster parents will be asked to fill out a digital questionnaire including demographic and background variables and including two instruments that were developed to detect children with FASD. The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Questionnaire (FASQ) developed by Feldmann (Scheffner, 2011) includes 38 items presenting social, behavioral and emotional problems of children and adolescents indicative of FASD. The Neurobehavioural Screening Tool (NST; Nash, Koren, & Rovet, 2009) is based on ten questions from the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: Data collection is in progress. Parents are currently being approached and asked to complete the questionnaire. First results are expected in September 2012. Conclusion: Based on the high risk background of foster children, we expect that children in foster care show elevated levels of behavioral problems related to FASD, and that there is a significant relationship between these problems and the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy of the mother. An increased rate of such behavior problems will be a strong indication for the need for diagnosticians and foster care workers to focus more on FASD.

N2  - Objectives: The Russian Federation has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the world; however, little is known about the existing pool of research related to prenatal alcohol exposure, and particularly Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in this country. The objective of this study was to locate and review published and unpublished studies concerning any aspects related to FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure conducted in or using populations from the Russian Federation. Materials & Methods: A systematic literature search was performed simultaneously in the Russian Federation and Canada. The search was conducted in multiple (English and Russian) electronic bibliographic databases, using multiple combinations of the key words in both Russian and English. In addition, the search was conducted in several major libraries in Moscow. Results: In total, only 60 studies were identified and included in the current review: 48 studies were in Russian and 12 were in English. The examined studies can be categorized into the following four major groups: those that 1) assessed alcohol consumption during pregnancy; 2) examined Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and FASD prevalence in the general population, and/or foster homes and orphanages; 3) clinically examined children and adults and demonstrated the life-long polysystemic teratogenic effect of alcohol on the fetus; and 4) experimentally studied the teratogenic effect of alcohol on laboratory animals. The results of the studies are exceptionally alarming. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy varies from approximately 14% to 83% in various regions of the Russian Federation. Binge drinking is reported to occur in up to 21% of pregnancies. The prevalence of FAS in the general population was estimated in only one study, which reported the prevalence to be as 18-19 per 1,000 live births. This figure is approximately 20 times higher than that reported for the general population of Canada. The prevalence of FAS in orphanages for children with special needs was reported extremely high - ranging from about 427 to 680 per 1,000. Conclusion: Given the alarming prevalence rates of prenatal alcohol exposure and FASD, very little is being done in terms of research in this area within the Russian Federation. An increase in attention by the research community is urgently needed in order to improve the overall awareness of the negative consequences of consuming alcohol while pregnant, as well as the initiation of preventive measures in this country.

N2  - Objectives: Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a public health priority. FASD prevention programs can be broadly categorized into universal, selective and indicated based upon the breadth of the target population, the risk of having children with FASD, and the cost-benefit ratio of committing resources. Establishing and strengthening policies and plans for FASD prevention require an informed consideration of what is known to be effective. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the scientific literature on the effectiveness of FASD prevention on prenatal alcohol use- and FASD-related outcomes. Materials & Methods: Searches in biomedical electronic databases and the grey literature were conducted for the period from 1970 to February 2012 to identify studies (i.e., randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), observational analytical cohort studies, and uncontrolled trials) assessing universal, selective, and indicated prevention interventions targeting the broad community, pregnant women, women of childbearing age, women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) or of having a child with FASD. Results: From 3,455 references retrieved, 59 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review (Universal = 19, Selective = 30; Indicated = 10). The best scientific evidence on the effectiveness of universal FASD prevention is derived from two studies of moderate-to-weak methodological quality that evaluated a multimedia education program targeting youth in the community. Multimedia and macro-level education programs produced a statistically significant improvement in the level of knowledge regarding FASD and the effects of alcohol drinking during pregnancy. Studies assessing universal interventions such as alcohol-related warning messages, health educational activities and alcohol bans were of poor quality; and, overall, did not show that these interventions lead to significant modifications in knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of risks associated with drinking during pregnancy. Compared to universal preventive interventions, the following selective preventive interventions have a better scientific evidence base (overall strong and moderate quality) for their effectiveness: motivational interviewing, counselling activities and health education programs for women of childbearing age who consume alcohol, pregnant women, and women at risk of AEP. The scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of indicated approaches is weak and inconclusive. Conclusion: The scientific base to support the effectiveness of universal and indicated approaches for prevention of FASD is limited. Moderate evidence for selective prevention activities such as counselling, motivational interviewing and health education for pregnant women and women at risk of AEP is encouraging.

N2  - Objective: For children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) preterm birth (PTB) is frequently reported. Preterm birth may cause a variety of motor and cognitive deficits in the premature infant. The effect of preterm birth on the motor cognitive outcome in patients with FAS is unknown. Matierals & Methods: We assessed the mental and motor development of 48 children with PTB and 30 children with FAS using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II). Groups were matched for age (PTB: M = 25 months, SD = 3 months; FAS: M = 27 months, SD = 6 months). Of the children with PTB, 31 had bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or intracranial hemorrhage, 17 had no birth complications. Of the FAS children, 12 had PTB (all without birth complications). Results: In the BSID-II, PTB children without birth complications had a mean mental (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) that were close to normal (MDI = 98, PDI = 92). PTB children with birth complications had a mean MDI of 85 and a mean PDI of 81. Children with FAS had a mean MDI of 79 and a mean PDI of 80. MDI was higher in FAS children with PTB compared to FAS children without PTB (81 vs. 77). Conclusions: PTB, although frequently in FAS, seems not to contribute to the mental or motor development deficits in children with FAS. Deficits are caused predominantly by the prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Moreover, in children with FAS, PTB without complications seems to moderate the effects of PAE.

N2  - Background: Alcoholism during pregnancy is one of the most common factors in western societies causing persisting congenital and multiple physical as well as neurological impairments. Finding the diagnosis at first sight puts medical professionals into a demanding situation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect patients' developmental characteristics with the main focus on the necessity of the diagnosis itself. Patients: 125 young patients, whose diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made at the Muenster University Hospital, were followed up. Materials & Methods: Biographic details such as living conditions, health, developmental problems and educational career were gathered using a structured interview. The diagnosis itself and the impact of this on the patients were also explored. Results: Patients displayed characteristics of a less mature trait of character. The majority were looked after by foster parents. High rates of social and developmental problems could be found. The diagnosis was identified as a protective factor, with significantly better outcomes for patients being diagnosed in early childhood. A diagnosis established later in life was particularly helpful for the families and caregivers. Feelings of failure and self-blame could be diminished. Conclusions: The early detection of affected children has to be improved as receiving the correct diagnosis, despite the persistent impairments, is of major benefit for both patients and their families.

N2  - Objectives: According to a study at the Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca of Murcia, only 29% of women don't drink any alcohol in the preconception period (the most critical to the fetus). The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has announced that a low level consumption of alcohol (1 or 2 units once or twice a week) has not yet been found to be harmful to women or their babies (http://www.rcog.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1996). However, the Spanish Society of Obstetrics and Ginecology (SEGO), in cooperation with the Association of Brewers of Spain, has launched, since 2009, the educational campaign "A pregnancy without", which aims to raise awareness among pregnant women about the incompatibility of alcohol consumption during the pregnancy period, with the slogan "Because he drinks what you drink". The campaign is proposed to beer drinkers; who are pregnant; plan to become pregnant or breastfeeding, choose non-alcoholic variety. Materials & Methods: During the campaign messages are disseminated through information materials, supervised by the Spanish Ministry of Health, gynecologists across the country providing useful information about alcohol-free beer as an alternative to the traditional one and how could integrated into the habits of the pregnant woman. Additionally, the campaign also includes the dissemination of information brochure that is aimed at pregnant women that has collected various recommendations to help them follow a complete and balanced diet. In order to increase the dispread of messages among pregnant women, and society in general, there was a wide broadcasting of campaign messages in the media. Results: All members of SEGO (with 6,300 national partners) have received some information and materials on the properties of non-alcoholic beer as an alternative to traditional beer during pregnancy, emphasizing the dangers of drinking in this period. Also were distributed over 500,000 information brochure among pregnant women and women who want to be. Conclusion: This campaign is an example of good practice in prevention and public health and scientific collaboration between an association whose objective is to ensure the health and individual sectors committed to preventing cases of inadequate intake of beer. Thanks to it has been possible to achieve satisfactory results in relation to the spread, helped by the information campaign in the media where the SEGO warned of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Objectives: The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical, mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The measurement of ethylglucuronide (EtG) in alternative biological matrices, including neonatal and maternal hair, neonatal meconium, and maternal nails is receiving increasing interest for the accurate evaluation of the utero exposure to alcohol. Aims: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between EtG in maternal hair and nails with EtG in neonatal meconium to further explore the suitability of these biomarkers in disclosing prenatal exposure to ethanol. Materials & Methods: A total of 151 maternal hair strands (0-6 cm), nail clips (2-6 mm) and corresponding neonatal meconium and nails samples were obtained from neonatal wards of 4 Mediterranean public hospitals: Rome, Florence and Belluno in Italy and Barcelona in Spain. Hair, nails and meconium were analyzed for the presence of EtG by validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay. Meconium was also analyzed for the presence of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) as a complementary biomarker of in utero exposure to alcohol. Results: On the basis of the accepted cut-off for EtG and FAEEs in neonatal meconium, 18 newborns resulted in utero exposed to maternal alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, none of these cases were confirmed by the presence of EtG in maternal hair and nails, which resulted all negative to this biomarker. Conversely, one high positive result in nails (24 pg EtG/mg nail) was obtained in Pakistan woman, whose hair resulted negative to EtG likewise the meconium of her newborn. Low maternal education level was associated with biomarker scores over the cutoff. There was also a significant correlation between the highest percentage of prenatal exposure in the capital and certain maternal sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusion: Obtained results confirm that EtG and FAEEs in meconium are the best biomarker to assess in utero exposure to maternal alcohol. The 18 newborns exposed to maternal ethanol came from mothers who declared alcohol consumption through the entire pregnancy, but not on daily basis and with no more than 1 drink per day.This fact led us to suppose that firstly EtG in hair and nails is not a good biomarker to disclose an alcohol consumption lower than on daily basis and lower than one alcoholic unit per day. Secondly that both in case of hair and in that of nails, the amount of collected sample is crucial to obtain a positive result, since available methods are yet not enough sensitive for less than 20 mg keratin matrices.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as a probable etiological factor for neuropsychological deficits and late behavior problems in the offspring of alcohol abuse mothers. Materials & Methods: A systematic review was performed by searching scientific articles through the bibliographic databases Pubmed, Lilacs, Web of Knowledge and Science Direct using the following search terms: "Prenatal Alcohol Exposure AND Cortisol". Thirty-two papers were selected. Results: Thirty two studies were identified, alls wrote in English; most of them published in the United States of America (11) and Canada (15). Other studies were published in United Kingdom (2), Norway (1), Germany (1), China (1) and Netherlands (1). The oldest paper was written in 1994 and a total number of twenty four was produced in the last decade. This research found that HPA axis is highly susceptible to programming during fetal and neonatal development and that prenatal alcohol exposure programs the fetal HPA axis such that HPA tone is increased throughout life. This work also detected that maternal alcohol consumption increases HPA activity in both mother and the offspring. Therefore, this increment, by exposing the fetus to endogenous glucocorticoids along the lifespan, can alter the behavioral and physiologic sensibility increasing vulnerability to sickness and disorders later in life. Furthermore, we find possible differential effects of subjacent mechanisms of alcohol on male and female offspring, with special emphasis on effects at different levels of the HPA axis, and on modulatory influences of the hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal hormones and serotonin. Conclusion: Considering the amount of scientific evidence it seems very plausible to admit the influence of prenatally alcohol exposure to developmental changes in the maturation of the hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal axis leading to its late dysfunction in life and, therefore,.

N2  - Objectives: Awareness, education, and prevention are key to eliminating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which is a 100% preventable lifelong disability. The aim of this presentation is to share resources and ways that the community is being engaged in Edmonton, Canada. The main goals are to raise awareness, provide new resources, and to get conversations started so that we can put forth a clear message that no alcohol is best during pregnancy. A music video and cell phone ringtone have just been created and released in order to target youth and young adults. This video is a unique resource that is being used in various settings and has received extensive positive feedback. Prevention initiatives and a public health message will be at the forefront of this interactive presentation. Materials & Methods: A power point presentation will be used. Also, print materials will be handed out, the music video 'You Can Choose' will be shown that has been created in partnership with the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum of Services (FASS) and the Edmonton Fetal Alcohol Network (EFAN), and information will be provided on how to access the free ringtone. Results: The presentation shared resources and provided information on what new and unique tactics are being used in the Edmonton community to raise awareness about this invisible, preventable disability. Conclusion: As a community it is our responsibility to work together to raise awareness and to educate on FASD. By providing information and having an open discussion we can help to start these much needed conversations and begin to break down the stereotypes, misconceptions, and stigma associated with alcohol, pregnancy, and FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Early detection of maternal alcohol consumption in pregnancy is the crucial point in prevention and/or early diagnosis of FAS and FASD. The tools currently in use for patient interrogation are the same tools used for detection of alcohol use disorders in non-pregnant subjects. Questionnaires like the CAGE, T-ACE, AUDIT and TWEAK are well established to detect a high and/or regular consumption of alcohol, whereas they can cause denial in subjects with low alcohol consumption leading to false negative screening results. Our aim was to develop a new questionnaire with reduced risk for false negative results. Materials & Methods: We developed a questionnaire that includes an evaluation system for immediate risk stratification. In retrospective testing using patient files as well as a prospective study applicability of the "Berliner EvAS"-questionnaire has been tested. Results: "Berliner EvAS"-questionnaire is an easy to use, non-stigmatizing tool to detect alcohol consumption in pregnancy. In our retrospective analysis, risk stratification by "Berliner EvAS" shows good consistency with data from biochemical screening results for alcohol. Conclusion: Early detection of FAS and FASD relies on diagnosis of maternal alcohol consumption. With the risk stratification of "Berliner EvAS", pregnancy counseling can focus on patients at risk for alcohol related birth defects. At the second European Conference on FASD, we present an English translation of our tool.

N2  - Objectives: The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) was established by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol (NIAAA) in 2003 with the overall goal of improving the diagnoses of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). It is a multidisciplinary, multisite, international project combining both clinical and basic science projects. To date, CIFASD it has involved projects in seven different countries, including four in Europe. The major objective is to provide an overview and update on CIFASD, highlighting major accomplishments to date Materials & Methods: CIFASD utilizes a comprehensive approach to many of the critical questions in FASD research including improved diagnosis and enhanced understanding of the dysmorphology, neurobehavioral phenotypes, and neuropathology associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. One goal of CIFASD is to integrate information from three modalities (brain, face, and behavior) at a variety of ages, to guide early recognition of FASD with greater sensitivity. Our research projects utilize state-of-the-art techniques in brain imaging, craniofacial image analysis, behavioral phenotyping, and genetics. Results: Our brain imaging project is examining data longitudinally, as preliminary data suggest a difference in the trajectory of brain developmental between alcohol-exposed and control children. Our behavioral projects are refining the profiles of cognitive deficits following prenatal alcohol exposure, and showing similarities and differences between behaviors of children with an FASD compared to those with ADHD. Our work on facial imaging may better identify not only individuals with FAS, but also those with subclinical features. We are examining potential biomarkers of alcohol exposure, and how genetic and nutritional variables modify FASD to better identify individuals with, or at risk for FASD. Conclusion: Our efforts are accelerating progress in identifying children with prenatal alcohol exposure, which we envision will lead to earlier and improved interventions. This work should inform promising practices in the identification and treatment of individuals exposed to alcohol prenatally.

N2  - Objectives: Alcohol consumption by pregnant women is related to fetal damage resulting in a large spectrum of physical and behavioral problems in the offspring. This study aimed to assess fetal exposure to alcohol in pregnant women through questionnaires, interviews and postpartum data in a Brazilian sample of pregnant women. Materials & Methods: Data were collected longitudinally from 66 pregnant women since the first trimester of pregnancy as well from their newborns. All participants are living in the region of Ribeirao Preto, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The questionnaires T-ACE (Tolerance, Annoyed, Cut down, Eye-Opener) and AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) were employed as screening instruments for alcohol use. Postpartum information was collected such as: birth weight and length, childbirth delivery type and newborn gender. Results: T-ACE positive pregnant women scored 2.69 +/- 0.79 and 9.2 +/- 4.1 in the questionnaires T-ACE and AUDIT (N = 36), respectively. The average number of drinks in the first, second and third trimester was 50.4, 12.6 and 15.7, respectively for the T-ACE positive group. Two thirds (66.67%) of the sample of pregnant women were found as AUDIT positive (cut-off > 7.0). A statistically significant inverse Spearman correlation was found only for newborns of female sex for birth length and AUDIT total score (N = 16, rho = - 0.556, p = 0.025). No newborn was found as a clinical FAS case, and all other birth parameters were found in the normal range. Conclusion: No statistical differences were observed in relation to anthropometric variables except for birth length in the female newborn. Meconium samples have been collected and will help to complement this study, allowing comparison of these values with the information provided by pregnant women and providing an objective measure in order to validate the findings.

N2  - Objectives: The adverse effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy have been widely reported, and represent a leading preventable cause of physical and cognitive birth defects in the United States (Bertrand, 2009; Hoyme et al., 2005; Wilton and Plane, 2006). Brief, effective interventions are needed to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy in sexually active women who drink and do not use effective contraception. Materials & Methods: The Healthy Choices study compared the efficacy of a brief intervention delivered either over the telephone or in-person. In addition to indicators of alcohol use, contraception methods and compliance were examined, along with measures of mood and domestic violence. Women between the ages of 18 and 44 who were drinking above recommended levels and not using effective contraception were randomly assigned to either a telephone intervention group (n=68) or in-person intervention group (n=63). Results: Overall, participants showed significant reductions in alcohol use, and increases in effective use of contraception (thus reducing their risk of an alcoholexposed pregnancy). There was no significant difference in success of the intervention between the two conditions (telephone vs. in-person). Conclusion: Telephone-based brief intervention can be successful and cost-effective in reducing the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy and the incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Objective: It is estimated that 35 to 50% of the Dutch pregnant women continue to consume alcohol in pregnancy despite the accumulating evidence that even low levels of prenatal alcohol exposure can cause adverse neurobehavioral effects in children. We used an RCT to test the effectiveness of a health counselling method by midwives (HC) and an Internet-based computer tailored method (CT) in reducing prenatal alcohol use. Materials & Methods: Sixty midwife practices recruited 400 pregnant women who had consumed alcohol since they knew they were pregnant. Nineteen practices (138 respondents) were assigned to the HC condition and provided brief health counseling and self-help materials to stop drinking alcohol. Twentyone practices (118 respondents) were assigned to the CT condition. Pregnant women of these practices received personalized tailored feedback via the Internet. Twenty practices (144 respondents) were assigned to the control group (CG); respondents of these practices received routine alcohol advice. The main outcome measures were alcohol abstinence and alcohol use three months after baseline. Multilevel multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate whether HC and CT in addition to potential confounding and moderating variables had an effect on the outcome variables. Results: Multilevel logistic analyses with alcohol abstinence at T1 as outcome variable showed significant differences between CT and CG. CT significantly decreased alcohol use at T1 (odds ratio 0.379, 95% confidence interval 0.145 - 0.990) compared to CG. Differences between HC and CG with regard to alcohol abstinence at T1 were not significant. Multilevel linear analyses with average alcohol consumption at T1 showed a significant interaction effect between condition and alcohol use before pregnancy. HC was more effective for respondents with a lower alcohol use before pregnancy compared to respondents with a higher alcohol use before pregnancy (regression coefficient B 0.027, 95% confidence interval 0.014 - 0.041). Conclusions: More research is needed to understand why HC interacts with alcohol use before pregnancy. This significant interaction may imply that midwives provide different educational messages on alcohol in pregnancy to different clients. Another explanation may be that the effectiveness of HC for pregnant women who used a small amount of alcohol before pregnancy is due to the content of the intervention. Nevertheless, this research has shown that CT is an effective intervention to increase alcohol abstinence of pregnant women. A nationwide launching of this relatively inexpensive method has high potential to decrease the number of Dutch pregnant women using alcohol.

N2  - Objectives: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are preventable birth defects directly linked to consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, resulting in a significant public health cost burden. Current estimates suggest that 1% or 5 million people are living with fetal alcohol brain injury in Europe. Many medical and allied health professionals are key to (1) primary prevention of FASDs through working with women of childbearing age and (2) secondary prevention through working with affected individuals whose lives can be greatly improved with knowledge based interventions. The aim of this work was to demonstrate the pressing and urgent need for European health and allied health service providers to upskill their employees with the knowledge and ability to deal and manage FASD affected children & adults. Materials & Methods: Participants were drawn from Social Work, Psychology and Foster & Adoptive Parents who participated in FASD training in three different European sites (Ireland, United Kingdom, and Poland) during 2011. Training was delivered using core material from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder(s) Competency - using Curriculum Development Guide for Medical and Allied Health Education and Practice (CDC) alongside relevant local data of prevalence rates of FASD and drinking rates in pregnancy as applicable to the site of the training. Data was collated using structured evaluation questionnaires along with themed group work within the training events. Results: Evaluations from these multi-site training events suggest that Training, Education and Policy development concerning FASD is sought by allied health professionals, Foster & Adoptive Parents in order to properly respond to the needs of individuals living with FASD. The data suggests that there is an increased need for awareness of the life long disability of FASD and the complex problems faced by professionals to respond in a professionally competent manner. Conclusion: The evaluation of three European training events suggest that competence, especially when viewed separately in terms of knowledge versus capacity for application of information, in the area of FASDs is lacking in both the provider and caring professionals. Addressing this may be best achieved through the undertaking of a structured 'Training Needs Analysis' in multiple sites throughout the EU.

N2  - Objectives: Children with FASD are at risk for behavioral and mental health problems. Research in the last decade describes associations between prenatal alcohol exposure and psychiatric symptoms in childhood. As far as we know, there was no study about this subject for Brazilian children. Therefore, our main goal was to investigate in a Brazilian community sample the relationship between maternal alcohol consumption in pregnancy and psychopathology in the school-age offspring. Materials & Methods: The study design was of a longitudinal study, which, started at the third trimester of pregnancy with the assessment of alcohol consumption in 449 pregnant women and that continues till to the present with the follow-up of the children. This sample had 22.1% of women identified as risky alcohol drinkers by means of screening using the short questionnaire T-ACE. From the original sample we have evaluated 59 children of the cohort. Child mental health problems were assessed with the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and through semi-structured psychiatric interview (KSADS- PL). Results: We found a statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference for the average total CBCL score when comparing children of mothers who did not consume alcohol in pregnancy (M = 41 +/- 24.3) compared to children of mothers with at least once per week consumption of alcohol (M = 60.7 +/- 36.0), as well a statistically significant difference for the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses (K-SADS-PL) among groups (34.8% x 77.8%; p= 0.017). Conclusion: These results suggest an association between regular consumption of alcohol in at least once per week pattern during pregnancy with psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses in the school age offspring. This study is most probably the first for a Brazilian sample. The research project will continue forward aiming to expand the assessment of this Brazilian sample with the inclusion of biochemical, neuroimaging and neuropsychological methods.

N2  - Background: FASD is the term used to describe different categories of consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. Abnormal growth and characteristic physical features can be present in FASD, and then the diagnostic term is the fetal alcohol syndrome with complete or partial features. Materials & Methods: All systems used to establish diagnostic criteria for FASD (Institute of Medicine, Canadian guidelines, 4 digit coding system), assess the presence or absence of the 3 major physical features (short palpebral features, smooth philtrum and upper lip) growth deficits (height and weight <10%) and physical evidence of central nervous system involvement (microcephaly) to identify the different diagnostic categories. In order to identify the physical features associated with FAS, several important facts should be taken into account: 1). Expert physical diagnosis can be necessary. FAS is a dysmorphic syndrome with similar features to several genetic or other teratogenic syndromes with intellectual disability and behavioral problems. A differential diagnosis with other conditions should always be made, especially when the full pattern of malformation characteristic of FAS is not present. Genetic tests may be needed to rule out other causes. 2). Several studies have proven that additional facial features such as abnormal ears (railroad track ears), ptosis of the eyelids, midface hypoplasia and a long philtrum, are all characteristic features or FAS. Other characteristic non-facial features include contractures of one or multiple joints (camptodactyly and others), limitation of pronation and supination of the elbow, clinodatyly of the 5th finger of the hands, and most importantly, abnormal hand creases (hockey stick crease and others) are also very specific to FASD and should be taken into account for this diagnosis. 3) It has been proven that all these physical features together in a pattern are very specific to FAS, and their presence should be a firm indicator that the etiology of learning or behavioral problems is in fact prenatal exposure to alcohol. In the absence of physical findings, firm recognition of exposure or the presence of a very characteristic neurobehavioral profile are necessary in order to make a diagnosis of FASD. 4) Many of these features are predictors of more severe neurobehavioral involvement, and lower IQs are seen in patients with the most prominent physical features. They can be predictors of outcome, according to the number (dysmorphology scores) and severity of the growth deficits and the dysmorphic features. Conclusions: We believe the identification of these physical features should be part of the knowledge of any pediatrician of other professional dealing with children at risk for FASD, but only expert physical diagnosis can assess some difficult cases and make sure no other condition is present, especially in the absence of known prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - Background: The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical, mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objectives: Assessment of exposure to ethanol at both prenatal and postnatal stages is essential for early prevention and intervention. Since pregnant women tend to underreport alcohol drinking by questionnaires, a number of biological markers have been proposed and evaluated for their capability to highlight gestational drinking behaviour. Materials & Methods: These biomarkers include classical biomarkers (albeit indirect) of alcoholinduced pathology (mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) acetaldehyde-derived conjugates, and finally derivatives of nonoxidative ethanol metabolism (fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG), ethyl sulphate (EtS) and phosphaditylethanol (PEth)). Since ethanol itself and acetaldehyde are only measured few hours after ethanol intake in conventional matrices such as blood, urine and sweat, they are only useful to detect recent ethanol exposure. In the past few years, the non-oxidative ethanol metabolites have received increasing attention because of their specificity and in some case wide time-window of detection in non-conventional matrices from the pregnant mother (oral fluid and hair) and fetusnewborn (neonatal hair, meconium, placenta and umbilical cord). Conclusions: This presentation reviews the markers of ethanol consumption during pregnancy and related prenatal exposure. In addition, clinical toxicological applications of these procedures are presented and discussed.

N2  - Objectives: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is a leading preventable cause of the birth defects, which can include physical, mental, behavioral and or learning disabilities with possible lifelong complications. Unfortunately many of Polish women are not aware of that and according to data from 2009, 14% of all young women and 29% of those who have been drinking in the past 12 months, have been drinking alcohol during pregnancy. The goal of PARPA is to increase social awareness in the issue of FASD. Materials & Methods: The ways of sharing the information of FASD by social events, campaigns, educational programs or publications, and also by giving the assistance of experts to all the groups involved in the topic. PARPA is expanding the knowledge by conducting and participating in the international projects. Results: Research on FASD issue will increase the knowledge, the social awareness and will lead to better prevention. During the current year, the Training and Diagnosing Center will start its work in The Child St. Louis Hospital in Cracow. Conclusion: What PARPA is planning to obtain is the information about the prevalence of FASD in Poland among children (7-9 years old) and gain the most productive tool for diagnosing children with FASD. Moreover, we are planning to conduct second edition of nationwide education campaign "Pregnancy With No Alcohol".

N2  - Objectives: This investigation's aim is to study features of maternal consumption of alcohol and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia, Russia). Materials & Methods: Quality and rate of Maternal Alcohol Consumption observation in 11 regions (uluses) by means of the interviews, physical assessment and study of case histories according to CDC recommendations (2004). Incidence and clinical features of FAS study in 13 uluses, orphanages and National Medical Center. 26 caucasian, 18 sakha and 12 native (evens, evenks) with FAS aged from 40 postmenstrual weeks to 7 years detailed observation by means of 4-digit Diagnostic Code, routine and agedependent developmental neurological assessment, brain ultrasonography, MRI, Denver test and Zhurba Scale. Results: Analysis of maternal alcohol consumption shows that from 0.7 to 6.1% of pregnant women in different uluses used alcohol, and from 0.2 to 4.5% drank heavily. There are no significant differences in maternal alcohol consumption in different ethnical groups. Incidence of FAS varies from 0.06 to 0.9% in child population of different uluses. We haven't found significant correlation between maternal alcohol consumption level and incidence of FAS in the uluses (r = 0.559; p = 0.093).Incidence of FAS varies from 0.3% in National Medical Center to 11.3-34.0% in orphanages. Our investigation demonstrates that native babies with FAS were born pre-term much oftener than sakha infants (chi2 = 4.54; p = 0.033). Sakha children with FAS have smaller birth weight and height than caucasian ones (chi2 = 4.35-5.90; p = 0.037-0.015). Clinical assessment and neurovisualization show that caucasian patients have ptosis and ventriculodilatation significantly more frequently than sakha babies (chi2 = 5.11-5.97; p = 0.024-0.015); sakha infants have much more frequently muscle tone deviations, inborn heart defects, visual nerve atrophy and subarachnoid space dilatation than other ones (chi2 = 11.55-4.10; p = 0.0007-0.043). Native children demonstrate better quality of social adaptation than caucasian babies (chi2 = 10.26-4.10; p = 0.0014). Conclusion: Our investigation shows the necessity of taking into account ethnical and regional features of maternal alcohol consumption and FAS manifestation in epidemiological and clinical study.

N2  - Objectives: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a very common and completely avoidable disease. FAS has severe consequences not only for the individual and its direct environment but also for the health and social system in Germany. Aims: The first aim of the development of the German guideline was the determination of evidence-based and in practice easily applicable diagnostic criteria for the identification of FAS in children and adolescents in Germany. With help of the defined diagnostic criteria FAS should be diagnosed and treated earlier, so secondary complications can be reduced. The second aim was to create awareness in the German society of the severe complications of intrauterine alcohol exposition in order to decrease the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and diminish the incidence of FAS. Materials & Methods: A steering group in Munich and a consensus group consisting of representatives of the German Federal Ministry of Health, the German Professional Societies of Pediatrics, Neuropediatrics, Social Pediatrics, Gynecology, Neonatology, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Addiction Research and Therapy, Addiction Medicine, Addiction Psychology, Midwife Sciences, Midwives, Doctors of the Public Health Service, of the Patient Support Group FASworld Germany and additional FAS experts have been established in 2011. The AWMF (Association of the scientific medical societies) was responsible for the methodological guidance. Systematic literature retrieval and determination of levels of evidence were conducted by the AZQ (Medical Center for Quality in Medicine). Results: The methodological quality of the international and especially the German publications about the diagnostic criteria are rather poor. Most of the existing international guidelines for the diagnosis of FAS are consensus- but not strictly evidence-based. Evidence-and consensus-based criteria for the diagnosis of FAS were evaluated and established for Germany. The methodological process is described. The implication of the guideline is performed by algorithms for pediatricians and general practitioners for the referral of children with suspected FAS. Another algorithm including the defined diagnostic criteria of FAS has been developed for experts Conclusion: There is great need for a standardized, multidisciplinary, quality assured and implementable prevention of FAS in Germany. The first step was the development of an evidence- and consensus-based diagnostic guideline for children with FAS in Germany.

N2  - Objectives: Diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is complex, with numerous competing diagnostic systems. All recent diagnostic systems require the presence of growth restriction, mental retardation and 3 characteristic facial features. Software developed at the University of Washington has been created to objectively analyse digital photographs, measuring for the unique triad of FAS facial features: small palprebral fissure length (PFL), thin upper lip and smooth philtrum. This software has been validated in older children, but has not been used in neonates. We are unable to find neonatal normal reference ranges for measures except PFL. Early diagnosis in children has been associated with better outcomes. This study aims to determine the feasibility of using the facial analysis software to identify features associated with fetal alcohol exposure in normal neonates and if successful to develop normal reference ranges for Caucasian neonates. Materials & Methods: Ethics approval and informed consent was obtained. Healthy Caucasian neonates were photographed according to a standardised protocol. Mothers were asked to fill out an anonymous lifestyle questionnaire including questions on alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Standard physical measurements of the baby were taken. PFL and upper lip circularity (LC) were measured using the software. Philtrum smoothness and LC was assessed on a 5 point likert scale using reference photos. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Results: 33 neonates were recruited. PFL was measurable in 24 photographs (72.7%). Mean PFL was 15.5mm (95% C.I 13.1 - 17.9mm).LC was measurable in 33 photographs (100%). Mean LC was 59.4 (95% C.I. 18.1 - 100.5). Median LC and philtrum smoothness Likert ranks were both 3. 4 neonates were assessed as having FAS type features according to Likert ranking including 2 with abstinent mothers. 7 mothers (21.2%) reported drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Conclusion: It was possible to measure a full data set on just over 3/4 of neonates, demonstrating the feasibility of this method at this age. Mean PFL from this pilot study was significantly below previous published reference ranges. Current Likert scale reference photos may not be appropriate for neonates. Further data collection is required for development of robust reference ranges using this method.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of comprehensive community-based interventions to reduce fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in two populations from the Northern Cape Province in South Africa. Materials & Methods: Changes in the prevalence of FASD, and in maternal knowledge and drinking behaviour, were assessed in De Aar and Upington, Northern Cape Province, before and after an intensive community-level intervention. Eight community workers implemented educational activities to raise awareness of the risks of maternal drinking and to alter community norms about alcohol use in pregnancy. All children were examined by two dysmorphologists at 9 months of age and those with evidence of FASD were reassessed at 18 months. Neuropsychometrists evaluated infant neurodevelopment. Structured maternal interviews with FASD cases and matched controls determined patterns of alcohol use and knowledge about FASD. Results: At baseline, 809 children were evaluated, 751 after intervention. FASD prevalence pre-intervention was 8.9% (72/809) and 5.7% post intervention (43/751; P=0.02). In multivariate logistic regression, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity, FASD prevalence was 0.73 fold lower post-intervention than pre-intervention (95%CI=0.58-0.90; P=0.004). Dysmorphology scores reduced from 4 at baseline (IQR=2-7) to 3 (IQR=1-6; P=0.002). After intervention, a large proportion of women reported having received educational messages, levels of knowledge about alcohol increased and some changes were detected in attitudes to drinking. Conclusion: Comprehensive community-level interventions might reduce the burden of FASD in heavily-affected areas of South Africa, by about 30%. This, the first study ever to document the effectiveness of FASD prevention using clinical outcomes, suggests that comprehensive community-level services should be implemented in similar settings to reduce this very common, oft neglected, disorder.

N2  - Background: Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, has recently been detected in cord blood of infants born to alcohol-abusing mothers. Formic acid detoxification requires folic acid. However, in a rodent model, placental folate-receptors have decreased expression after alcohol exposure. We hypothesize that folate transport to the fetus will be decreased after chronic alcohol exposure and that these decreased levels will limit the ability to detoxify formic acid. These factors may, in part, contribute to deficits in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Objectives: To determine if alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in lower folate transport to the fetus and whether lower folate levels decrease the ability to detoxify formic acid. Methods: Serum folate was measured in maternal and cord blood at delivery from alcohol-abusing mothers and controls. As an in vitro model, a choriocarcinoma cell line (BeWo) was characterized after culturing in folate-free conditions. Results: The fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was <1.0 in half of the alcohol-exposed pairs (n=12), whereas all of the controls were >1.0 (n=8). Mean folate in cord samples was lower in alcohol-exposed cord than in the controls (25.83 +/- 13.58 vs. 44.04 +/- 10.86, p<0.01). BeWo cells were found to proliferate and maintain normal morphology when introduced into folate-free DMEM. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that folic acid transport to the human fetus is compromised in pregnancies affected by alcohol-abuse. BeWo cells can proliferate under folate-free conditions and will be utilized to investigate formate kinetics and toxicity.

N2  - Background: Many children with heavy exposure to alcohol in utero display characteristic alterations in brain size and structure. However, the long-term effects of low-to-moderate alcohol exposure on these outcomes are unknown. Methods: Using voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest analyses, we examined the influence of lower doses of alcohol on gray and white matter composition in a prospectively recruited, homogeneous, well-characterized cohort of alcohol-exposed (n = 11, age 19.5 +/- 0.3 years) and control (n = 9, age 19.6 +/- 0.5 years) young adults. A large proportion of the exposed individuals were born to mothers whose alcohol consumption during pregnancy was in the low-to-moderate range. Results: There were no differences in total brain volume or total gray or white matter volume between the exposed and control groups. However, gray matter volume was reduced in alcohol-exposed individuals in several areas previously reported to be affected by high levels of exposure, including the left cingulate gyrus, bilateral middle frontal gyri, right middle temporal gyrus, and right caudate nucleus. Notably, this gray matter loss was dose dependent, with higher exposure producing more substantial losses. Conclusions: These results indicate that even at low doses, alcohol exposure during pregnancy impacts brain development and that these effects persist into young adulthood. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders result from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and are characterized, in some cases, by central nervous system anomalies and cognitive impairment. Regional patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities suggest that alcohol exerts selective damage on the developing fetal brain. This study assessed brain-behavior relationships in a sample of youth with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. The aim was to characterize how structural brain alterations observed in our previous studies relate to cognitive deficits commonly reported in individuals with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Twenty-one youth (mean age 13 years) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 7 nonexposed healthy comparison subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and neurobehavioral testing. Regional brain volumes within the alcohol-exposed group were correlated with neuropsychological measures of cognitive control and verbal learning/recall, as these aspects of cognition have previously been shown to be vulnerable to alcohol teratogenesis. Results: Between-group effect sizes revealed moderate to large cognitive performance and brain volume decrements in alcohol-exposed subjects, compared with typically developing peers. Within the alcohol-exposed group, volume of the caudate nuclei was the most consistent predictor of neuropsychological performance, after controlling for potentially confounding variables including total brain volume, IQ, and age. Conclusions: These data are consistent with previous research associating gestational alcohol exposure with structural and functional changes of the caudate nucleus. Our findings extend this previous work by demonstrating that volume reductions of the caudate have behavioral relevance for this population, in relation to cognitive control and verbal learning and recall abilities. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Exposure to alcohol in utero can cause birth defects, including face and brain abnormalities, and is the most common preventable cause of intellectual disabilities. Here we use structural magnetic resonance imaging to measure cortical volume change longitudinally in a cohort of human children and youth with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a group of unexposed control subjects, demonstrating that the normal processes of brain maturation are disrupted in individuals whose mothers drank heavily during pregnancy. Trajectories of cortical volume change within children and youth with PAE differed from those of unexposed control subjects in posterior brain regions, particularly in the parietal cortex. In these areas, control children appear to show a particularly plastic cortex with a prolonged pattern of cortical volume increases followed by equally vigorous volume loss during adolescence, while the alcohol-exposed participants showed primarily volume loss, demonstrating decreased plasticity. Furthermore, smaller volume changes between scans were associated with lower intelligence and worse facial morphology in both groups, and were related to the amount of PAE during each trimester of pregnancy in the exposed group. This demonstrates that measures of IQ and facial dysmorphology predict, to some degree, the structural brain development that occurs in subsequent years. These results are encouraging in that interventions aimed at altering "experience" over time may improve brain trajectories in individuals with heavy PAE and possibly other neurodevelopmental disorders. ©2012 the authors.

N2  - The maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy causes birth defects and lifelong disabilities in the affected children. Due to the wide range of symptoms related to prenatal alcohol exposition, the umbrella term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is used. FASD covers full Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (pFAS). Children with FAS are smaller in length and weight than healthy children of their age. Head circumference s smaller as well. Typical signs of FAS are facial characteristics such small eyes, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip. Many affected children only show distinct behavioural problems (pFAS). Children with FAS or pFAS do not recognize dangerous situations, they would go with anyone, and are easily influenced. They are forgetful, do not learn from consequences. The diagnosis of FAS goes by small size and weight of the children, and the typical facial alterations. pFAS, however, is diagnosed if behavioural, social and emotional problems are present, and prenatal alcohol exposition is assured by anamnesis. Medical treatment is supplemented by occupational and behavioural therapy. The affected children need instruction, orientation, apportionment concerning time (and space), and a firm daily routine. At legal age, most patients with FASD are not able to live autonomously. They are naive and easily talked into things, therefore they require long-lasting care.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Aims: To examine the effect of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy on infant behavioral outcomes and birth weight, and to investigate the differential susceptibility of infant behavioral outcomes and birth weight to prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Data on children born to women taking part in the United States National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) (n = 1618) were analyzed using the sibling fixed-effects model, which helps adjust for maternal, genetic and social confounders when examining effects of pre-natal exposure to possible toxins such as alcohol. Mothers were classified as non-drinkers, light-to-moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers according to their frequency of alcohol use during pregnancy. Infants' behavioral outcomes were assessed using the modified Rothbart Infant Behavior Questionnaire in the NLSY, which measures three dimensions of behavioral outcomes: positive mood, fearfulness and difficultness. Results: Estimates from the model indicated that drinking during pregnancy was positively associated with infant difficultness, but not with positive mood or fearfulness. Further analysis by frequency of alcohol use suggested that both light-to-moderate and heavy drinking were associated with an increase in infant difficultness. Additionally, while low-to-moderate drinking during pregnancy was associated with infant difficultness, drinking at this level was not associated with low birth weight. Conclusion: The findings suggest that maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is a risk factor for infant behavioral outcomes, after taking into account many confounding factors. Infant behavioral outcomes appear to be more vulnerable to light-to-moderate levels of alcohol use during pregnancy than birth weight is. © The Author 2012.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading non-genetic cause of neurodevelopmental disability in children. Although alcohol is clearly teratogenic, environmental factors such as gravidity and socioeconomic status significantly modify individual FASD risk despite equivalent alcohol intake. An explanation for this variability could inform FASD prevention. Here we show that the most common nutritional deficiency of pregnancy, iron deficiency without anemia (ID), is a potent and synergistic modifier of FASD risk. Using an established rat model of third trimester-equivalent binge drinking, we show that ID significantly interacts with alcohol to impair postnatal somatic growth, associative learning, and white matter formation, as compared with either insult separately. For the associative learning and myelination deficits, the ID-alcohol interaction was synergistic and the deficits persisted even after the offsprings' iron status had normalized. Importantly, the observed deficits in the ID-alcohol animals comprise key diagnostic criteria of FASD. Other neurobehaviors were normal, showing the ID-alcohol interaction was selective and did not reflect a generalized malnutrition. Importantly ID worsened FASD outcome even though the mothers lacked overt anemia; thus diagnostics that emphasize hematological markers will not identify pregnancies at-risk. This is the first direct demonstration that, as suggested by clinical studies, maternal iron status has a unique influence upon FASD outcome. While alcohol is unquestionably teratogenic, this ID-alcohol interaction likely represents a significant portion of FASD diagnoses because ID is more common in alcohol-abusing pregnancies than generally appreciated. Iron status may also underlie the associations between FASD and parity or socioeconomic status. We propose that increased attention to normalizing maternal iron status will substantially improve FASD outcome, even if maternal alcohol abuse continues. These findings offer novel insights into how alcohol damages the developing brain. © 2012 Rufer et al.

N2  - Ethanol is a legal and widely available substance. There are health and social consequences associated with its abuse. One of the most important problems is related to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In fact, prenatal ethanol exposure can be associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), a term used to describe a wide range of potentially lifelong effects that include physical, mental, behavioral, and learning disabilities. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), which are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol, are currently used as biomarkers of direct ethanol consumption in different matrices, including hair, blood, skin surface, and meconium. Analysis of these compounds in meconium reveals exposure to alcohol during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. An important finding for evaluation of gestational ethanol exposure is the fact that FAEEs do not cross the placenta. Because they accumulate in the fetal gut from approximately the 20th week of gestation until birth, this provides a wide window of detection of chronic exposure to alcohol. The sum of the concentrations of all the FAEEs, with a cutoff of 2 nmol g -1 or 600 ng g-1 meconium, has been recommended as evidence of maternal alcohol use. We introduce a novel technique to quantify ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl stearate, and their deuterated analogues (as internal standards, IS) in meconium using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Limits of detection and quantification were 50 and 100 ng g-1 for all analytes except ethyl stearate (LOD 100 ng g-1 and LOQ 500 ng g-1). Calibration curves were linear from the LOQ to 5000 ng g-1. The validated method was applied to the analysis of 81 meconium samples. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy may result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which is an umbrella term used to describe a range of conditions that are associated with significant neurodevelopmental impairments. Communicating an FASD diagnosis to a child is a complex and difficult task that requires a great deal of care, particularly due to the sensitive nature of the etiology of these disorders. To the best of our knowledge, there are no formal guidelines or published materials that outline the ethical considerations specifically associated with disclosing an FASD diagnosis to a child. This paper discusses a number of ethical principles and situational factors that should be considered when communicating an FASD diagnosis, as well as some of the potential risks and benefits associated with disclosure. We also provide recommendations to assist clinicians in communicating the diagnosis in a manner that increases understanding and minimizes harm to the child. Future recommendations include the development of formalized guidelines in order to aid clinicians in carrying out this sensitive task. © 2012 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Background: Most children who are exposed to large quantities of alcohol in utero do not develop fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Population-based prospective data on the risk of developing components of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), however, are limited. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of 9,628 women screened during their first prenatal appointment in Chile, which identified 101 who consumed at least 4 drinks/d (exposed) matched with 101 women with no reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy (unexposed). Detailed alcohol consumption data were collected during the pregnancy. Children were evaluated up to 8.5 years of age by clinicians masked to exposure status. Results: One or more functional central nervous system abnormalities were present in 44.0% (22/50) of the exposed children compared to 13.6% (6/44) of the unexposed (p = 0.002). Growth restriction was present in 27.2% (25/92) of the exposed and 12.5% (12/96) of the unexposed (p = 0.02). Abnormal facial features were present in 17.3% (14/81) of the exposed children compared to 1.1% (1/89) of the unexposed children (p = 0.0002) by direct examination. Of the 59 exposed children with data available to detect at least 1 abnormality, 12 (20.3%) had no abnormalities. Binge drinking from conception to recognition of pregnancy (OR = 1.48 per day, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.91, p = 0.002) and after recognition of pregnancy (OR= 1.41 per day, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.95, p = 0.04) and total number of drinks consumed per week from conception to recognition of pregnancy (OR = 1.02 per drink, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.04, p = 0.0009) were significantly associated with abnormal child outcome. Conclusions: After exposure to heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy, 80% of children had 1 or more abnormalities associated with alcohol exposure. Patterns of alcohol use that posed the greatest risk of adverse outcomes were binge drinking and high total weekly intake. Functional neurologic impairment occurred most frequently and may be the only sign to alert physicians to prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Both sensory and cognitive deficits have been associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol; however, very few studies have focused on sensory deficits in preschool-aged children. As sensory skills develop early, characterization of sensory deficits using novel imaging methods may reveal important neural markers of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Participants in this study were 10 children with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and 15 healthy control (HC) children aged 3 to 6 years. All participants had normal hearing as determined by clinical screens. We measured their neurophysiological responses to auditory stimuli (1,000 Hz, 72 dB tone) using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We used a multidipole spatio-temporal modeling technique to identify the location and timecourse of cortical activity in response to the auditory tones. The timing and amplitude of the left and right superior temporal gyrus sources associated with activation of left and right primary/secondary auditory cortices were compared across groups. Results: There was a significant delay in M100 and M200 latencies for the FASD children relative to the HC children (p = 0.01), when including age as a covariate. The within-subjects effect of hemisphere was not significant. A comparable delay in M100 and M200 latencies was observed in children across the FASD subtypes. Conclusions: Auditory delay revealed by MEG in children with FASDs may prove to be a useful neural marker of information processing difficulties in young children with prenatal alcohol exposure. The fact that delayed auditory responses were observed across the FASD spectrum suggests that it may be a sensitive measure of alcohol-induced brain damage. Therefore, this measure in conjunction with other clinical tools may prove useful for early identification of alcohol affected children, particularly those without dysmorphia. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Pathological changes in skeletal remains are difficult to diagnose, but may provide some clues as to the personal history and identification of an individual. In 2011, a skeletonized forensic case of a juvenile individual was received from the Northern Cape. The remains were suspected to have belonged to a girl who went missing in 2003. The aim of this study is to report on the findings from this case. Anthropological assessment indicated that the remains possibly belonged to a female individual of 12-15 years. Several pathological changes and skeletal abnormalities were observed which included an abnormally shaped head with bulging forehead, slight microcephaly, facial asymmetry, enamel hypoplasia, cribra orbitalia, spina bifida occulta of L1, and growth retardation. A tentative diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made, and it was later confirmed by SAPS that the suspected parents of this individual have a history of alcohol abuse. FAS occurs in children born to women who consume large quantities of alcohol during pregnancy. This condition presents various degrees of severity, and this case probably represents an extreme version of FAS. Differential diagnosis would include malnutrition, chronic infectious disease, or mental retardation of other causes. Although not conclusive, the combination of abnormalities seen in this individual is strongly suggestive of FAS, and to our knowledge this is the first skeletal case with this condition to be reported.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Hyperactivity and inattention are major effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Although predominantly women from the high social class consume alcohol during pregnancy, children from the low social class are particularly affected by the adverse effects of PAE. This study aimed to test the hypothesis of a social gradient in hyperactivity/inattention in children with PAE. Methods: Children with PAE (N=996) enrolled in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) were studied. KiGGS was designed and conducted by Robert Koch Institute (RKI) as a nationwide representative survey on the health of German children and adolescents aged 0-17 years. The data include information given by parents and adolescents on the physical and mental health, sociodemographic features, life circumstances and conditions. Results: PAE children with a middle and low parental socioeconomic status (SES) are on a higher risk of developing hyperactivity/inattention compared to those with high parental SES. Cultural-behavioral factors had the strongest effect in the explanation of social inequalities in hyperactivity/inattention among children with PAE. Conclusions: Cultural-behavioral factors, particularly health-related behaviors, need a significant improvement in children from the low and middle social class. To reduce social inequalities in hyperactivity in children with PAE, interventions have to focus on the dietary and television habits of the child by reaching parents from the low and middle social class.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Not all women who consume alcohol during pregnancy have children with FASD and studies have shown that genetic factors can play a role in ethanol teratogenesis. We examined gene expression in embryos and placentae from C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice following prenatal alcohol exposure. B6 fetuses are susceptible to morphological malformations following prenatal alcohol exposure while D2 are relatively resistant. Methods: Male and female B6 and D2 mice were mated for 2 hours in the morning, producing 4 embryonic genotypes: true-bred B6B6 and D2D2, and reciprocal B6D2 and D2B6. On gestational day 9, dams were intubated with 5.8 g/kg ethanol, an isocaloric amount of maltose dextrin, or nothing. Four hours later, dams were sacrificed and embryos and placentae were harvested. RNA was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 v2 microarray chips. Data were normalized, subjected to analysis of variance and tested for enrichment of gene ontology molecular function and biological process using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Results: Several gene classes were differentially expressed in B6 and D2 regardless of treatment, including genes involved in polysaccharide binding and mitosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure altered expression of a subset of genes, including genes involved in methylation, chromatin remodeling, protein synthesis, and mRNA splicing. Very few genes were differentially expressed between maltose-exposed tissues and tissues that received nothing, so we combined these groups for comparisons with ethanol. While we observed many expression changes specific to B6 following prenatal alcohol exposure, none were specific for D2. Gene classes up- or down-regulated in B6 following prenatal alcohol exposure included genes involved in mRNA splicing, transcription, and translation. Conclusions: Our study identified several classes of genes with altered expression following prenatal alcohol exposure, including many specific for B6, a strain susceptible to ethanol teratogenesis. Lack of strain specific effects in D2 suggests there are few gene expression changes that confer resistance. Future studies will begin to analyze functional significance of the expression changes. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: The identification of individuals exposed prenatally to alcohol can be challenging, with only those having the characteristic pattern of facial features, central nervous system abnormality, and growth retardation receiving a clinical diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Methods: Seventeen anthropometric measurements were obtained at 5 and 9 years from 125 Cape Town, South African children, studied since birth. The children were divided into 3 groups: FAS or partial FAS (PFAS), heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE), and non-alcohol-exposed controls (C). Anthropometric measurements were evaluated for mean group differences. Logistic regression models were used to identify the subset of anthropometric measures that best predicted group membership. Anthropometric measurements were examined at the 2 ages in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure obtained prospectively from the mothers during pregnancy. Correlation of these facial measurements with key neurobehavioral outcomes including Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-IV IQ and eyeblink conditioning was used to assess their utility as indicators of alcohol-related central nervous system impairment. Results: Significant group differences were found for the majority of the anthropometric measures, with means of these measures smaller in the FAS/PFAS compared with HE or C. Upper facial widths, ear length, lower facial depth, and eye widths were consistent predictors distinguishing those exposed to alcohol from those who were not. Using longitudinal data, unique measures were identified that predicted facial anomalies at one age but not the other, suggesting the face changes as the individual matures. And 41% of the FAS/PFAS group met criteria for microtia at both ages. Three of the predictive anthropometric measures were negatively related to measures of prenatal alcohol consumption, and all were positively related to at least 1 neurobehavioral outcome. Conclusions: The analysis of longitudinal data identified a common set of predictors, as well as some that are unique at each age. Prenatal alcohol exposure appears to have its primary effect on brain growth, reflected by smaller forehead widths, and may suppress neural crest migration to the branchial arches, reflected by deficits in ear length and mandibular dimensions. These results may improve diagnostic resolution and enhance our understanding of the relation between the face and the neuropsychological deficits that occur. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a common cause of intellectual impairment and birth defects. More recently, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been found to be a risk factor for fetal mortality, stillbirth and infant and child mortality. This has led to increased concern about detection and management of PAE. One to 2 h after maternal ingestion, fetal blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) reach levels nearly equivalent to maternal levels. Ethanol elimination by the fetus is impaired because of reduced metabolic capacity. Fetal exposure time is prolonged owing to the reuptake of amniotic-fluid containing ethanol by the fetus. Alcohol elimination from the fetus relies on the mother's metabolic capacity. Metabolic capacity among pregnant women varies eightfold (from 0.0025 to 0.02 g dl-1 h-1), which may help explain how similar amounts of ethanol consumption during pregnancy results in widely varying phenotypic presentations of FASD. At birth physiological changes alter the neonate's metabolic capacity and it rapidly rises to a mean value of 83.5% of the mother's capacity. FASDs are highly recurrent and younger siblings have increased risk. Detection of prenatal alcohol use offers an important opportunity for office-based interventions to decrease exposure for the remainder of pregnancy and identification of women who need substance abuse treatment. Mothers of children with FAS have been found to drink faster, get drunk quicker and to have higher BACs. A modest increase in the prevalence of a polymorphism of alcohol dehydrogenase, which increases susceptibility to adverse outcomes from PAE has been reported. Lastly, detection of alcohol use and appropriate management would decrease risk from PAE for subsequent pregnancies. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading cause of intellectual disability in the Western world. Due to the organic brain damage caused by alcohol, and the resulting cognitive, functional, and behavioural deficits, people with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) are at high risk for becoming involved in the legal system, either as offenders or as victims, if appropriate diagnosis, interventions and support services are not initiated early in life and maintained throughout the life-course. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of incarceration for youths (12-18 years) with FASD, compared to youths without FASD, in Canada. Using the epidemiological data available on the prevalence of incarceration in youths with FASD and data on the prevalence of incarceration in youths without FASD in the general population of Canada, it was estimated that youths with FASD are nineteen times more likely to be imprisoned than youths without FASD, on any given day in a specific year. These alarming study findings emphasize the need to incorporate screening for FASD as early as possible in the criminal justice process. It is crucial to better understand the mental disabilities of offenders prenatally exposed to alcohol and make appropriate referrals for mental health and other services.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the leading preventable cause of developmental disabilities in the United States and likely throughout the world. FASDs can be prevented by avoiding alcohol use during pregnancy; however, efforts to prevent risky alcohol consumption in women of childbearing potential have not been universally successful. Objectives: Data suggest that successful interventions may require tailoring methods to meet the needs of specific populations and cultures. Key findings of interventions previously tested among American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) women who are or may become pregnant, data gaps, and promising ongoing interventions are reviewed. Methods: A systematic review of the current literature on empirically based interventions among AI/AN women was conducted. Selected alternative approaches currently being tested in AI/AN settings are also described. Results: Similar to findings among other populations of women in the United States, a number of interventions have been implemented; however, only a small number have measured results. Approaches have included standard interventions involving hospitalization, inpatient, or outpatient care; wellness education; traditional approaches; and case management for high-risk women. An ongoing Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocol comparing the effectiveness of a web-based culturally adapted tool, or a peer health educator model to standard clinical practice is described. Conclusion: Translation of successful interventions from other settings to AI/AN populations holds promise. Scientific Significance: FASDs represent a significant health issue with high personal and societal costs. Improvement of interventions to prevent prenatal alcohol consumption in specific populations, including AI/AN women, is a critical public health need. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - While it is known that suboptimal maternal vitamin D status can be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, the frequency of low vitamin D status in many populations is a subject of debate. Our ongoing study investigates the nutrient status of alcohol-exposed Ukrainian pregnant women and whether micronutrient supplementation can reduce the risk of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Blood samples and alcohol consumption data are collected at the time of enrollment (mean gestational age, 20.4 +/-7.0 wk). Here we present data on the baseline vitamin D status of these women. Mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [25(OH)D] of alcohol-exposed (n=180) and unexposed (n=180) women were 20.6 ng/mL and 21.8 ng/mL, respectively. Across both groups, 50.6% and 32.9% were classified as vitamin D deficient [25(OH)D <20ng/mL] or insufficient [25(OH)D >20 ng/mL and <30 ng/mL], respectively. When adjusted for solar radiation by month, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestation age at blood draw, smoking status, and age, regression analyses showed that each additional oz. of alcohol consumed per drinking day, in the 2 weeks prior to the time of enrollment, was associated with a 2.4 ng/mL decrease in 25(OH)D concentrations (P=0.03). These data suggest a very high prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D status in pregnant Ukrainian women and an adverse effect of alcohol consumption on vitamin D status.

The effects of low to moderate prenatal alcohol exposure in early pregnancy on IQ in 5-year-old children. BJOG 2012;119:1191-1200. Objective To examine the effects of low to moderate maternal alcohol consumption during early pregnancy on children's intelligence (IQ) at age 5 years. Design Prospective follow-up study. Setting Neuropsychological testing in four Danish cities 2003-2008. Population A cohort of 1628 women and their children sampled from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Methods Participants were sampled based on maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. At 5 years of age, children were tested with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R). Parental education, maternal IQ, maternal smoking in pregnancy, the child's age at testing, gender, and tester were considered core confounding factors, whereas the full model also controlled for maternal binge drinking, age, BMI, parity, home environment, postnatal smoking in the home, health status, and indicators for hearing and vision impairments. Main outcome measures The WPPSI-R. Results No differences in test performance were observed between children whose mothers reported consuming between one and four or between five and eight drinks per week at some point during pregnancy, compared with children of mothers who abstained. For women who reported consuming nine or more drinks per week no differences were observed for mean differences; however, the risks of low full-scale IQ (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.2-18.2) and low verbal IQ (OR 5.9; 95% CI 1.4-24.9) scores, but not low performance IQ score, were increased. Conclusions Maternal consumption of low to moderate quantities of alcohol during pregnancy was not associated with the mean IQ score of preschool children. Despite these findings, acceptable levels of alcohol use during pregnancy have not yet been established, and conservative advice for women continues to be to avoid alcohol use during pregnancy. © 2012 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology © 2012 RCOG.

N2  - The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical, mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objective assessment of exposure to ethanol at both prenatal and postnatal stages is essential for early prevention and intervention. Since pregnant women tend to underreport alcohol drinking by questionnaires, a number of biological markers have been proposed and evaluated for their capability to highlight gestational drinking behaviour. These biomarkers include classical biomarkers (albeit indirect) of alcohol-induced pathology (mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) acetaldehyde-derived conjugates, and finally derivatives of non-oxidative ethanol metabolism (fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG), ethyl sulphate (EtS) and phosphaditylethanol (PEth)). Since ethanol itself and acetaldehyde are only measured few hours after ethanol intake in conventional matrices such as blood, urine and sweat, they are only useful to detect recent ethanol exposure. In the past few years, the non-oxidative ethanol metabolites have received increasing attention because of their specificity and in some case wide time-window of detection in non-conventional matrices from the pregnant mother (oral fluid and hair) and fetus-newborn (neonatal hair, meconium, placenta and umbilical cord). This article reviews bioanalytical procedures for the determination of these markers of ethanol consumption during pregnancy and related prenatal exposure. In addition, clinical toxicological applications of these procedures are presented and discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a group of disorders caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. From this group, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the only disorder coded in the International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10). This coding was used to gain an understanding on the health care utilization and the mortality rate for individuals diagnosed with FAS, as well as to estimate the associated health care costs in Canada for the most recent available fiscal year (2008-2009). Methods: Health care utilization data associated with a diagnosis of FAS were directly obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). Mortality data associated with a diagnosis of FAS were obtained from Statistics Canada. Results: The total direct health care cost of acute care, psychiatric care, day surgery, and emergency department services associated with FAS in Canada in 2008-2009, based on the official CIHI data, was about $6.7 million. The vast majority of the most responsible diagnoses, which account for the majority of a patient's length of stay in hospital, fall within the ICD-10 category Mental and Behavioural Disorders (F00-F99). It was evident that the burden and cost of acute care hospitalizations due to FAS is increasing -1.6 times greater in 2008-2009, compared to 2002-2003. The mortality data due to FAS, obtained from Statistics Canada (2000-2008), may be underreported, and are likely invalid. Discussion: The official data on the utilization of health care services by individuals diagnosed with FAS are likely to be underreported and therefore, the reported cost figures are most likely underestimated. The quantification of the health care costs associated with FAS is crucial for policy developers and decision makers alike, of the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure, with the ultimate goal of initiating preventive interventions to address FASD. © 2012 Popova et al.

N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to alcohol often results in disruption to discrete cognitive and behavioral domains, including executive function (EF) and adaptive functioning. In the current study, the relation between these 2 domains was examined in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, nonexposed children with a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and typically developing controls. Methods: As part of a multisite study, 3 groups of children (8 to 18 years, M = 12.10) were tested: children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 142), nonexposed children with ADHD (ADHD, n = 82), and typically developing controls (CON, n = 133) who did not have ADHD or a history of prenatal alcohol exposure. Children completed subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS), and their primary caregivers completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II. Data were analyzed using regression analyses. Results: Analyses showed that EF measures were predictive of adaptive abilities, and significant interactions between D-KEFS measures and group were present. For the ADHD group, the relation between adaptive abilities and EF was more general, with 3 of the 4 EF measures showing a significant relation with adaptive score. In contrast, for the ALC group, this relation was specific to the nonverbal EF measures. In the CON group, performance on EF tasks did not predict adaptive scores over the influence of age. Conclusions: These results support prior research in ADHD, suggesting that EF deficits are predictive of poorer adaptive behavior and extend this finding to include children with heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol. However, the relation between EF and adaptive ability differed by group, suggesting unique patterns of abilities in these children. These results provide enhanced understanding of adaptive deficits in these populations, as well as demonstrate the ecological validity of laboratory measures of EF. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Acute and Long-Term Purkinje Cell Loss Following a Single Ethanol Binge During the Early Third Trimester Equivalent in the Rat
A1  - Idrus N.M.
A1  - Napper R.M.A.
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: In the rat, binge-like ethanol (EtOH) exposure during the early neonatal period (a developmental period equivalent to the human third trimester) can result in a permanent deficit of cerebellar Purkinje cells (Pcells). However, the consequences of a moderate binge alcohol exposure on a single day during this postnatal period have not been established. This is an issue of importance as many pregnant women binge drink periodically at social drinking levels. This study aimed to identify both the acute and long-term effects of exposure to a single alcohol binge that achieved a mean peak blood EtOH concentration of approximately 250 mg/dl during early postnatal life using a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Methods: Acute apoptotic Pcell death 10 hours after a moderate dose binge EtOH exposure from postnatal days (PDs) 0 to 10 was assessed using active caspase-3 immunolabeling. Acute Pcell apoptosis was quantified in cerebellar vermal lobules I-X using the physical disector method. Long-term effects were assessed at PD 60 using stereological methods to determine total Pcell numbers in the vermis, lobule III, and lobule IX, following a moderate dose binge EtOH exposure at PDs 0, 2, or 4. Results: Acute apoptosis was induced by EtOH on PDs 1 to 8 in a time and lobular-dependent manner. For EtOH exposure on PD 2, significant long-term Pcell loss occurred in lobule III. EtOH exposure on PD 4 resulted in significant long-term Pcell loss throughout the entire vermis. Conclusions: These results indicate that a single, early EtOH episode of moderate dose can create significant and permanent Pcell loss in the developing cerebellum. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability. The mechanisms underlying FASD are incompletely understood, and biomarkers to identify those at risk are lacking. Here, we perform metabolomic analysis of embryoid bodies and neural lineages derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells to identify the neural secretome produced in response to ethanol (EtOH) exposure. Methods: WA01 and WA09 hES cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies, neural progenitors, or neurons. Cells along this progression were cultured for 4 days with 0, 0.1, or 0.3% EtOH. Supernatants were subjected to C18 chromatography followed by ESI-QTOF-MS. Features were annotated using public databases, and the identities of 4 putative biomarkers were confirmed with purified standards and comparative MS/MS. Results: EtOH treatment induced statistically significant changes to metabolite abundance in human embryoid bodies (180 features), neural progenitors (76 features), and neurons (42 features). There were no shared significant features between different cell types. Fifteen features showed a dose-response to EtOH. Four chemical identities were confirmed: l-thyroxine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, and the tryptophan metabolites, l-kynurenine and indoleacetaldehyde. One feature with a putative annotation of succinyladenosine was significantly increased in both EtOH treatments. Additional features were selective to EtOH treatment but were not annotated in public databases. Conclusions: EtOH exposure induces statistically significant changes to the metabolome profile of human embryoid bodies, neural progenitors, and neurons. Several of these metabolites are normally present in human serum, suggesting their usefulness as potential serum FASD biomarkers. These findings suggest the biochemical pathways that are affected by EtOH in the developing nervous system and delineate mechanisms of alcohol injury during human development. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) is associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as increased motor activity and elevated anxiety, that may last a lifetime. Persistent sleep disruption may underlie these problems. Using a rat model, we investigated long-term alterations of sleep-wake behavior following AE during a critical early developmental period. Male rats received 2.6. g/kg of alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group), or were sham-intubated (S group). On PD52-80, they were instrumented for tethered electroencephalogram and nuchal electromyogram recording and habituated to the recording procedures. Sleep-wake behavior was then recorded during one 24. h-long session. Wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were scored in 10. s epochs during 6. h of the lights-on (rest) and 6. h of the lights-off (active) periods. During the active period, REMS percentage was significantly lower (4.7. +/-. 0.9 (SE) . vs. 8.2. +/-. 0.9; . p<. 0.02) and the percentage of SWS tended to be lower (p=0.07) in AE than S rats (N=6/group). During the rest period, sleep and wake amounts did not differ between the groups, but AE rats had longer latency to both SWS and REMS onset (. p=. 0.02 and 0.003, respectively). Our data demonstrate that, in a rat model of prenatal AE, impaired sleep-wake behavior persists into the adulthood. Disordered sleep may exacerbate cognitive and behavioral disorders seen in human victims of prenatal AE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol may exert a significant detrimental effect on the functioning of the individual's brain, however few studies have examined this before birth. This longitudinal study examined the effect of maternal alcohol consumption on the elicited startle response of the fetus. Two groups of fetuses were examined: one whose mothers drank alcohol (approximately 10 units per week); the other whose mothers did not drink alcohol. Fetuses were examined at 29, 32 and 35. weeks gestation and their startle response observed using ultrasound in response to 2 presentations of a pink noise (70-250. Hz) at 90. dB(A) separated by 30. s. Fetuses exposed to alcohol exhibited a weaker startle response at 29. weeks gestation than did fetuses not exposed to alcohol. There was no difference in the response at 32 and 35. weeks gestation. To ensure that the effects were not due to a more general effect of alcohol on fetal movement, a second experiment compared the spontaneous movements (observed on ultrasound for 45. min) of fetuses whose mothers drank alcohol and fetuses of mothers who didn't drink alcohol. There were no differences in movements exhibited by the fetuses. The results suggest that exposure to alcohol delays the emergence of the elicited startle response at 29. weeks gestation but this delay has disappeared by 32. weeks gestation. The possible role of altered neural development, acute exposure to alcohol and disruptions to the fetus's behavioural repertoire, in mediating these effects are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Aims: Our aim is to investigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the development of retinal bipolar and horizontal cells. Methods: The alterations of the retinal bipolar and horizontal cells in P7, P14 and P30 mice were observed after PAE, with immunofluorescent labeling and DiI diolistic assay. Results: The retinal development of filial pups was affected by PAE in a dose-dependent and long-term manner. The number of bipolar cells of alcohol groups was significantly lower than that of the control, and the dendritic receptive field of horizontal cells was also significantly smaller than those of the control groups (P < 0.01). Conclusion: PAE was able to cause retarded development of pup retinal neural cells. © The Author 2012. Medical Council on Alcohol and Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and particularly, the most severe manifestation, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), are more common in disadvantaged populations. Developmental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) may be potentiated by environmental factors like suboptimal nutrition, found in emerging countries. To evaluate potential benefits of micronutrients, including choline, in the teratogenesis of PAE in an at risk population, we carried out a clinical trial at two Omni-Net sites in Western Ukraine, Khmelnitsky and Rivne. Methods. Alcohol-using and nondrinking women were recruited midpregnancy and randomized to one of three groups: multivitamin/multimineral supplement (MVM); MVM+choline; nonsupplemented group. Children (N=192) were followed-up at six months gestational age with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd ED) yielding standard scores for Mental Development Index (MDI), Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) and measures of orientation, emotional reactivity, motor performance and total behavioral functioning. Results. Generalized Linear Modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between amount of alcohol used (ounces of absolute alcohol per day preconception and during the two weeks prior to enrollment) with developmental outcomes. We collapsed the two supplement groups (Suppl group) and controlled effects of social class (SES), smoking, gender, vitamin and folic acid use prior to recruitment. At six months, MDI was significantly impacted by alcohol dose during the first trimester (beta=-14.66, X2(1)=9.3, p<.002) with those exposed to more alcohol having lower cognitive scores. Moreover, there was also an effect of Suppl with those who did not receive supplements performing more poorly (beta=-3.69, X2(1)=8.03, p<.005). The PDI scores did not differ by intervention group but showed a significant effect of 1st trimester alcohol dose (beta=-26.99, X2(1)=8.28, p<.004) on motor function. Orientation behavior also differed as a function of Suppl Group ((beta=-5.45, X2(1)=4.51, p<.03) and as a result of alcohol dose at conception (beta=-4.52, X2(1)=5.75, p<.02); Motor Optimality was affected by alcohol dose at conception and during the 1st trimester and there were no effects of factors measured on Emotional reactivity at this age. These results suggest that multimicronutrient supplementation can reduce the negative impact of alcohol use during pregnancy on specific developmental outcomes.

N2  - To assess neurodevelopmental outcome associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), encoding (learning) and memory of infants, ages 12-18 months, were assessed using cardiac orienting responses (ORs) during habituation/ dishabituation information processing (IP) paradigm. Methods. In an on-going clinical trial in Rivne, Ukraine, alcohol-using and nondrinking women were recruited midpregnancy and randomized to one of two multivitamin/mineral supplement groups or to NONE. This study included only the NONE group (N=47). Habituation stimuli, reflecting encoding and sustained attention, were presented for 10 trials and dishabituation stimuli, reflecting use of memory skills, were presented for five trials, with three first three trials of each analyzed. Heart rate (HR) was collected at a rate of 1000 samples per second and aggregated by second. Results. In a repeated measures analysis of covariance, the between subjects factors were PAE (yes/no) and the within subjects factors were stimulus (auditory/visual), condition (habituation/dishabituation), trial (1-3), and second (1-9). Covariates entered first into the model included child's age at assessment and baseline HR. A significant PAE by second interaction was found (F (8,232) = 2.21, p < .027). Post hoc comparisons indicated significantly less heart rate deceleration among those with a positive history of PAE compared to those without PAE on seconds 1-5 and 9. This effect varied by stimulus type (Stimulus*PAE*Second Interaction: F (8,232)= 2.09, p <.037) with PAE having greater deficits in response to the visual vs. auditory stimuli and by learning condition (Condition*Stimulus*PAE*Second Interaction: F (8, 232)=3.82, p < .000) with the effect stronger for habituation vs. dishabituation trials. Conclusion. PAE adversely impacts neurophysiological encoding and memory of environmental events. The rate of deceleration, as indicated by the differences in HR changes over time, was adversely affected by PAE. This pattern of responses reflects a delay in encoding environmental events and occurred regardless of the nature of the stimulus and the learning condition (habituation or dishabituation) but orienting responses were more negatively impacted by PAE using visual stimuli and during habituation.

N2  - The role of micronutrients in ameliorating the negative impact of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on learning and memory was explored in a randomized clinical trial conducted in Rivne, Ukraine. To assess neurodevelopmental outcome, cardiac orienting responses (ORs) during an information processing (IP) paradigm were obtained from 12-18 month old infants. Methods. Alcohol-drinking women and controls were recruited midpregnancy and randomized to supplement (Suppl) groups: None, Multivitamin/Minerals (MVM), and MVM plus Choline (MVM + Choline). Using cardiac responses, habituation and dishabituation during the IP paradigm were recorded, with habituation reflecting encoding and dishabituation, memory skills. Heart rate (HR) was collected at a rate of 1000 samples per sec and aggregated by sec. Baseline HR was collected for 30 sec prior to stimulus onset and then nine sec poststimulus onset from which difference values were computed for analysis for the first three trials of each condition. Results. A repeated measures analysis of covariance was used. The between subjects factors were PAE (yes/no) and intervention (None, MVM, MVM+Choline). The within subjects factors included stimulus (auditory/visual), condition (habituation/dishabituation), trial (1-3), and second (1-9). Covariates were child's age and baseline HR. Between subjects effects included a significant intervention (F (2, 54) =4.693, p<.013) and a trend for an interaction between intervention and PAE (F (2, 54) =3.03, p < .057). Post hoc comparisons indicated that those in the MVM+ Choline group had greater (p <.001) HR deceleration (HRD=6.8) as compared to the None group (HRD=1.6). A trend (p < .087) was found for the MVM (HRD=3.1) being lower than the MVM+ Choline group but this group did not differ from the None group. Relative to the interaction, among those without PAE, those in the MVM+ Choline performed better than those in both other groups. Among those with PAE, both intervention groups performed better than the no intervention group but did not differ from each other. Conclusion. Preliminary analysis suggested that choline supplementation during pregnancy may positively impact offspring's encoding and memory functioning regardless of PAE while multivitamin supplementation alone may provide a beneficial impact to infants with PAE.

T1  - The potential benefit of a multimicronutrient supplement in pregnant women who consume alcohol

N2  - Introduction: Novel interventions to prevent or ameliorate the effects of human teratogens have rarely been identified. Although the optimum prevention for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is to avoid pregnancy exposure entirely, efforts to change maternal behaviors with respect to alcohol have been less than universally successful. The possibility of a low-cost, acceptable, and effective intervention that would attenuate some of the prenatal effects of alcohol has important implications worldwide. Methods: In the context of the NIH-NIAAA Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, a multimicronutrient supplement intervention study has been ongoing in two regions of Ukraine. A total of 300 moderately to heavily alcohol-exposed pregnant women and 300 low or unexposed comparison women were recruited on average in the second trimester. Maternal nutritional status was assessed in blood at the time of enrollment, and women were randomly assigned within alcohol exposure group to one of three groups: multimicronutrient supplement, multimicronutrient supplement with an additional supplement containing 700mg. of choline, or standard of care. Outcomes measured included a standard dysmorphology examination for physical features of FASD in the newborn period and again at six and 12 months of age, and neurobehavioral assessments using two different paradigms at six and 12 months of age. Results: Baseline maternal nutritional status on selected micronutrients is associated with risk for selected alcohol-related facial features among those in the alcohol-exposed group, suggesting that maternal nutritional status early in development may be a protective or permissive factor for initiation of some structural effects in infants born to drinking mothers. Furthermore, among 6-month olds tested with the Bay ley, the effect of dose of alcohol was attenuated by multimicronutrient supplementation. Conclusion: The role of maternal nutritional status in moderating the effects of prenatal alcohol consumption is evolving as a potentially important factor. Moreover, the concept that a simple, low-cost intervention with vitamin-mineral supplements, initiated after recognition of pregnancy, can potentially rescue infants from some degree of deficit has important implications for prevention and intervention in multiple economic and cultural settings.

N2  - Alcohol consumption of mothers during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome associated with massive neuronal apoptosis. Acute exposure of developing rodents to alcohol causes likewise extensive apoptotic neurodegeneration throughout the brain. In our research we used 7 day-old mice as a model of fetal alcohol syndrom in humans. Using activated caspase-3 and TUNEL staining as markers of the apoptotic process we demonstrated that taurine at a dose of 2 g/kg saves in 7 day-old mice about 50% of dying neurons in the external and internal layers of the cerebellum from ethanol-induced apoptosis. In an attempt to rescue more neurons we increased the taurine dose two- and threefold. Ethanol (20% w/v solution) was administered subcutaneously at a total dose of 5 g/kg (2.5 g/kg at 1 h and 2.5 g/kg at 3 h). Taurine (7% solution) was injected in two half-doses (first at 0 h and second at 4 h). Opposite to our expectations the increased taurine doses administered to ethanol-injected mice induced death. The dose of 4 g/kg co-administered with ethanol killed 50% of mice and the dose of 6 g/kg killed them all. All mice treated with ethanol or taurine alone survived. We repeated the same regime in adult (5-6 months) and old (12-13 months) mice with different doses of ethanol and taurine injected intraperitoneally. The co-administration of taurine at a total dose of 10 g/kg with ethanol (8 g/kg) killed 100% of adult mice. In the old mice the lethal dose was 6 g/kg of taurine coadministered with 6 g/kg of ethanol. All adult and old mice treated with taurine or ethanol alone survived. The adult and old mice treated with ethanol and taurine showed a marked fall in the blood glucose level before their deaths. No changes occurred in the blood glucose level in mice which received only taurine or ethanol. We assume that the drop in blood glucose after the taurine and ethanol co-administration can be one reason of lethality. Comparison of the lethal doses of taurine and ethanol co-administration in 7 day-old, adult and old mice allows us to conclude that the adverse effects of taurine and ethanol combined toxicity is age-dependent. Our present findings are an important warning sign of the interactions of taurine and ethanol and their combined toxic effects, particularly for young people mixing taurine-containing energy drinks with alcohol.

T1  - The effects of perinatal choline supplementation on hippocampal cholinergic development in rats exposed to alcohol during the brain growth spurt

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure leads to long-lasting cognitive and attention deficits, as well as hyperactivity. Using a rat model, we have previously shown that perinatal supplementation with the essential nutrient, choline, can reduce the severity of some fetal alcohol effects, including hyperactivity and deficits in learning and memory. In fact, choline can mitigate alcohol-related learning deficits even when administered after developmental alcohol exposure, during the postnatal period. However, it is not yet known how choline is able to mitigate alcohol-related behavioral alterations. Choline may act by altering cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus. This study examined the effects of developmental alcohol exposure and perinatal choline supplementation on hippocampal M1 and M2/4 muscarinic receptors. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were orally intubated with ethanol (5.25 mg/kg/day) from postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to the human third trimester; control subjects received sham intubations. From PD 4-30, subjects were injected s.c. with choline chloride (100 mg/kg/day) or saline vehicle. Open field activity was assessed from PD 30 through 33, and brain tissue was collected on PD 35 for autoradiographic analysis. Ethanol-exposed subjects were more active compared to controls during the first 2 days of testing, an effect attenuated with choline supplementation. Developmental alcohol exposure significantly decreased the density of muscarinic M1 receptors in the dorsal hippocampus, an effect that was not altered by choline supplementation. In contrast, developmental alcohol exposure significantly increased M2/4 receptor density, an effect mitigated by choline supplementation. In fact, M2/4 receptor density of subjects exposed to alcohol and treated with choline did not differ significantly from that of controls. These data suggest that developmental alcohol exposure can cause long-lasting changes in the hippocampal cholinergic system and that perinatal choline supplementation may attenuate alcohol-related behavioral changes by influencing cholinergic systems. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Objectives: Folic acid (FOL) is concentrated in the fetal circulation by the placenta so that cord levels are higher than maternal levels. FOL is also required for detoxification of formic acid (FA), the toxic metabolite of methanol that has recently been observed in cord blood of infants born to alcohol-using mothers. The objectives of this study were to determine if FOL transport to the fetus is decreased after heavy alcohol exposure and therefore the ability to detoxify FA is compromised. These factors may contribute to deficits observed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Folate was measured in maternal and cord blood from alcohol-abusing mothers and controls. Results: The fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was <1.0 in half of the alcohol-exposed pairs (n=12), whereas all of the controls were >1.0 (n=8). Mean folate in cord samples was lower in alcoholexposed than in the controls (25.83+/-13.58 vs 44.04+/-10.86, p<0.01). There was a significant correlation between the control maternal and cord folate levels (p<0.05) whereas the alcohol group correlation was not significant. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that FOL transport to the fetus is compromised in pregnancies affected by alcohol-abuse. This supports our hypothesis that FA may indeed be a significant contributor in the etiology of FASD, and, that FOL as part of treatment to mitigate its effects needs to be investigated.

N2  - Objective To investigate the association between heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and stillbirth. Design Data linkage cohort study. Setting Western Australia (WA). Population The exposed cohort included mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, ninth/tenth revisions) recorded in health data sets and all their offspring born in WA (1983-2007). Mothers without an alcohol-related diagnosis and their offspring comprised the comparison cohort. Methods Exposed and comparison mothers were identified through the WA Data Linkage System. Odds ratios for stillbirth at 20 + weeks of gestation were estimated by logistic regression, stratified by Aboriginal status. Main outcome measures The proportion of stillbirths at 20 + weeks of gestation is presented per 1000 births, as well as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and population-attributable fractions. Results Increased odds of stillbirth were observed for mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis at any stage of their life for both non-Aboriginal (aOR 1.36; 95% CI 1.05-1.76) and Aboriginal (aOR 1.33; 95% CI 1.08-1.64) births. When an alcohol diagnosis was recorded during pregnancy, increased odds were observed for non-Aboriginal births (aOR 2.24; 95% CI 1.09-4.60), with the highest odds of Aboriginal stillbirth occurring when an alcohol diagnosis was recorded within 1 year postpregnancy (aOR 2.88; 95% CI 1.75-4.73). The population-attributable fractions indicate that 0.8% of non-Aboriginal and 7.9% of Aboriginal stillbirths are the result of heavy alcohol consumption. Conclusions Prevention of heavy maternal alcohol use has the potential to reduce stillbirths. The lack of an association between exposure during pregnancy and Aboriginal stillbirth in this study needs further investigation. © 2012 RCOG.

N2  - An adverse environment in fetal life, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), maternal alcohol consumption or stress predispose to preterm birth and increases the risk of adverse outcomes in the brain and cardiovascular system in later life. We investigated the effects of IUGR and alcohol on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity and baro-receptor sensitivity in fetal and neonatal sheep. Many of these adverse conditions are associated with an increase in oxidative stress. Melatonin (MT) protects against oxidative damage and we investigated its potential to protect the vascular system against IUGR. We studied the vascular system after birth when the lambs were 9 weeks old. IUGR resulted in an increase in coronary stiffness and a decrease in NO and EDHF effectiveness. MT improved NO bioavailability in controls and completely protected IUGR coronaries and abrogated stiffness. However, it reduced EDHF effectiveness in both control and IUGR coronaries. Alcohol exposure altered pulse wave velocity, markedly blunted baro-receptor sensitivity, and increased stiffness in coronary, renal, mesenteric and femoral arteries. Endothelial impairment, NO and EDHF, was evident in coronary, mesenteric and renal arteries, and renal arteries had a markedly reduced capacity to respond to NO in lambs exposed to alcohol before birth. An adverse intrauterine environment can result in significant vascular dysfunction that persists after birth. We show here that agents with a potential to rescue some aspects of this dysfunction may not have universal utility and hence must be thoroughly investigated in experimental models.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which encompass a range of physical, behavioral, learning, emotional and social disturbances. In spite of widespread educational efforts about the dangers of drinking during pregnancy, the incidence of FASD has not diminished and alcohol is now identified as the leading human teratogen. The failure of education to reduce the incidence of FASD makes it important to obtain understanding of the mechanism by which alcohol exposure causes neurodevelopmental damage in order to develop preventative and ameliorative strategies. In addition, successful implementation of a preventative or ameliorative strategy requires early identification of affected individuals. Currently, there is no effective means of identifying affected children during the prenatal period. The now well established sheep model offers some unique advantages in addressing these questions. Current projects investigating possible mechanisms for the alcohol induced neurodevelopment damage seen as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure and the evaluation of potential nutritional intervention strategies will be presented, as well as the use of MRI and ultrasound to develop a set of measurements that can be used as a screening tool to identify affected children.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) refers to specific diagnoses that describe individuals who have physical, mental, behavioral, and learning disabilities as a result of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Chudley et al., 2005). Many children may be affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but may not meet all of the diagnostic criteria for FASD. Individuals with FASD display high rates of secondary disabilities including mental health issues and problems with inappropriate sexual behaviors, school, the law, and substance use (Streissguth et al. 1996). The goal of the current project was to examine secondary disabilities and detailed information on mental health problems among Canadian children with PAE and FASD and how risk and protective factors and different types of services affect these outcomes. We also compared patterns of performance between undiagnosed children with PAE and those diagnosed with FASD. Participants included 72 alcohol-exposed children (aged 6 to 17) and their caregivers: 46 were diagnosed with FASD and 26 did not have an FASD diagnosis but had PAE. Caregivers completed a questionnaire measuring secondary disabilities and risk and protective factors (e.g., exposure to violence/abuse, quality and stability of home, having basic needs met for most of life, diagnosed before age 6) adapted from Streissguth et al. (1996). Caregivers also completed the Services for Children and Adolescents-Parent Interview (SCAPI) which measures service use across ten domains, and the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2) which measures behavioral, emotional, and mental health. Both the FASD and PAE group displayed high rates of many secondary disabilities and at-risk scores on the BASC-2. An older age of assessment was associated with more mental health, behavioral, and adaptive problems on the BASC, and more school problems and inappropriate sexual behaviors. Parenting classes were associated with fewer problems with the law and school. Some other services (medication use, school services, child therapy and respite) were actually associated with worse outcomes, which likely occurred because children with more problems were receiving these services. Finally, there were no differences between children with PAE and FASD in most analyses, indicating that outcomes are quite similar among those with PAE with and without a clinical diagnosis.

N2  - DNA methylation, a key epigenetic process, is known to regulate embryonic stem cells' development and is likely to mediate cell and tissue specification. To date, how DNA methylation mediates the neural specification and differentiation is unknown, and how alcohol, which is known to affect the methyl donor, might affect the process is unclear. We have previously demonstrated that de novo 5-methylcytosine (5mC) marks the neural stem cell differentiation temporally along the A-P axis and D-V patterning in the neural tube, which we referred to as a 5mC methylation program; alcohol retarded the 5mC program and subsequently the delayed neural maturation in early neural tube development (Zhou et al., 2011). Here, we demonstrated for the first time that the DNA methylation, including 5- hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC), is an intricate brain-region and neuronal cell-type specific program temporally progresses with regional brain maturation. Antibody-specific 5mC and 5hmC mosaicked in the nuclei at undifferentiated / neural stem cells, markedly polarized into chromatin compartments shown by DAPI-staining at the birth of post-mitotic neurons and over the path of neuronal migration. The 5mC and 5hmC were noticeably adopted a second mosaic distribution after arrival at the final destination and into the stage of wiring in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortices. The Tet1/2 enzyme-mediated 5hmC conversion occurred in all the neurons throughout the developing brain, but the further dramatic demethylation of 5mC and 5hmC is found brain region-specific. The DNA methylation binding protein MBD1 and MeCP2, which recruit suppressive factors, arrived in distinctly different patterns during neuronal migration and both increased progressively over neuronal maturation. We advocate that the intricate and long DNA methylation program leaves wide entries for environmental inputs. Alcohol exposure through maternal drinking at 100-200mg/dL BAC over 1st and 2nd gestations altered the methylation program described above. Alcohol exposed pups demonstrated an abnormal program of 5mC and 5hmC and differentially altered MBD1 and MeCP2. Since MBD1 and MeCP2 are heterogeneous in their targets, the effect of alcohol on gene transcription through altering various epigenetic marks is likely to be multiple. The alcohol's alteration of the intricate DNA methylation program is gaining supporting evidence as a key mechanism of neurodevelopment deficit in FASD.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has marked adverse effects on neurobiological and physiological systems. Our research has focused on the investigation of mechanisms mediating the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal (HPA) or stress axis and the immune system. These systems share ligands and receptors and are regulated by extensive bidirectional communication. Ethanol is administered to pregnant dams throughout gestation in a liquid diet fed ad libitum (36% ethanol-derived calories). A pair-fed group receives a liquid control diet, maltose-dextrin isocalorically substituted for ethanol, g/kg body wt/day of gestation. An ad-libitum-fed control group receives either control liquid diet or lab chow. Our data demonstrate that PAE programs the fetal HPA axis such that HPA tone and the response to stressors are increased throughout life, Long-term deficits in immune function are also observed, mediated either by direct effects of alcohol on the developing immune system and/or indirect effects via HPA dysregulation in the maternal female and/or the offspring. Consistent with the stress-diathesis hypothesis, we are testing the hypothesis that fetal programming sensitizes central neuroadaptive mechanisms, increasing the organism's response to subsequent, even mild, stressful events, and thereby increasing vulnerability to stress- and immune-related disorders. Several findings provide support for this hypothesis. PAE results in HPA dysregulation and changes in responsiveness that parallel, in many respects, alterations observed in depression. Moreover, in parallel with clinical findings, PAE animals exhibit sex-dependent increases in depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. In addition, PAE alters development of the immune system and adversely affects autoimmune function, resulting in an increased course and severity of inflammation in adjuvant-induced arthritis. Importantly, exposure to chronic mild stress in adolescence or adulthood exacerbates the adverse effects of PAE on both HPA and immune function. Fetal programming of the HPA axis may provide a final common pathway through which early life insults can alter vulnerability to diseases or disorders later in life. Changes in gene expression and possible epigenetic mechanisms may mediate fetal programming effects in our model.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), including Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE) resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure has been welldocumented in the Western world. With protective genetics (e.g., ADH2*2) in place, how FASD prevails in Eastern world has not been clear. We aim to report a prevalence study of FASD in East Taiwan. Methods: This study was performed in-school in Hualien County in East Taiwan which includes Taiwanese with ancestor of Chinese Han and aborigines with ancestor of Malaysia descent. From 1996 through 1998, data from 3817 students in 87 schools including 847 students from special schools, between 3 to 15 years old were enrolled. A three-stage evaluation process was used, including stage one: background history collection including birth weight & height, and maternal alcohol- or substance-use history during pregnancy; stage two: pediatric physical and neurological assessment including physical dysmorphism. A total of 3817 students complete the first two stages. Children with positive maternal alcohol consumption history and pre- or post-natal growth delay or facial/body dysmorphic characteristics, received stage three:-developmental or cognitive assessment. All the subjects were reviewed by pediatric geneticists, neurologists and psychologists on the same day. Results: Among participants with reported alcohol exposure during pregnancy, we confirmed seven children (1.83 per 1000 live births, 4 boys and 3 girls) with severe form described in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and fifteen (3.93 per 1000 live births, 9 boys and 6 girls) with alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficit without all facial dysmorphic features. With 300-character space, do you plan to add the numbers in special schools? Children with FAS had smaller head circumstance, lower body weight and lower body height than those with FAE. Also, children with FAS scored lower on intelligence tests than did children with non-FAS FASD. Conclusion: Using active case ascertainment in general schools and special schools, this study reported estimates of the prevalence of FASD in East Taiwan. Although with protective gene in Asian population, a comparable prevalence of FASD in East Taiwan is observed comparable to that of the Western world.

N2  - Children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure show reduced control of isometric (IM) and isotonic (IT) force as well as brain structural abnormalities in regions known to be involved in motor control, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. However, the relationship between regulation of motor force and neuroanatomical impairments has not been explored in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Prior studies have evaluated deficits in force regulation in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, and this study extended those studies by examining regional brain volumes associated with IM and IT force regulation in the same cohort of participants. Children with (ALC=9) and without (CON=7) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, who previously received assessment of force regulation, underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Measures of force regulation previously reported to differ between groups-response accuracy, response variability, and signal complexity-were correlated with regional brain volume after correcting for total intracranial volume; significant correlations were followed-up with multiple regression to control for age. In the ALC group, greater IM signal complexity was associated with smaller volume of the inferior parietal (IP) region, and greater IT response variability was correlated with larger volume of the anterior midbody of the corpus callosum. In the CON group, greater IT response variability and signal complexity was related to larger volumes in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, respectively. Findings provide a link between brain structure and force regulation and suggest altered influences of brain development on force production in alcohol-exposed children. Reductions in brain volume as a result of prenatal exposure to alcohol likely contribute to deficits in regulation of motor force in this clinical population. Force regulation is an important control parameter involved in complex movement, and the continued use of neuroimaging methods will help elucidate the relationships between brain and motor development in children with FASD.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a major, preventable cause of neurobehavioural and cognitive deficits in children. The developing brain is the principal target organ for gestational alcohol exposure. The full spectrum includes several diagnostic subgroups, and is collectively referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). There is a clear need to develop new tools for assessing brain function in the FASD population. Measurement of eye movement control is a powerful tool for assessing cognitive, sensory and motor function. Objective: To utilize standardized psychometric tests and measures of saccadic eye movement control to identify brain dysfunction in children with FASD. Methods: In this multi-centre study, each child completed a battery of psychometric tests and a set of structured saccadic eye movement tasks. The psychometric battery measured executive function, working memory, short-term memory, visuospatial skills, language and math ability. Depending on age, each child completed structured eye movement tasks that assessed sensory motor integration, response inhibition, cognitive flexibility and spatial working memory. Results: Preliminary analysis of both sets of tasks revealed significant differences between children with FASD and typically developing children. In both the pro- and antisaccade tasks, the children with FASD display significantly more hypometric initial saccades, which required a greater number of additional saccades per trial to arrive at the target. Also in the prosaccade task, the accuracy of the saccades were significantly poorer in children with FASD compared to controls. The children with FASD made significantly more direction errors in the antisaccade task. In the memory guided task, the children with FASD made significantly more timing errors, and also exhibited decreased accuracy in the task. Analysis of the data from the psychometric battery has revealed that the children with FASD scored significantly lower on every subtest administered except the NEPSY-II arrows task, a test of visuospatial processing. This result suggests that the deficits in eye movement control cannot be attributed to a general deficit in visuospatial processing capability. Conclusions: This study will provide greater insight into the motor and cognitive domains that are assessed using eye movement tasks, and will generate new knowledge that better defines the relationship between brain injury and behaviour in children with FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis, and this may underlie some of the behavioural and adaptive problems in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol show increased basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond infancy. We have completed a 3-year study on the effects of a strength-based, motor skill development program for children with FASD. Our hypothesis is that improvements in the motor domain will extend to other domains, and affect behaviour and adaptive functioning, possibly through effects on the HPA system. Our objectives were to determine the effect of the program on the HPA system (as indicated by salivary cortisol levels), and to compare cortisol levels of children with FASD to that of control children. Methods: Twenty-seven children (age 6-14 y) participated in an 8-week motor skill development program consisting of 2 x 1.5 hour sessions/week. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 24 children (FASD group) and compared at 4 time points: before, immediately after, 2 months, and 1 year after program completion. Cortisol levels were also compared to 32 control children (C group, no FASD) to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: wake-up, after school, and just before bedtime. Results: Salivary cortisol levels showed significant (p's<0.05) diurnal variation in all children, being higher at wake-up, compared with after school and bedtime, and higher after school compared to bedtime. Cortisol levels did not vary significantly over the 4 time points in the C or FASD groups, indicating that there was no effect of the motor skill program on cortisol levels. When the time points were combined, cortisol levels were significantly higher in the afternoon (p=0.033) and at bedtime (p=0.026), but not at wake-up, in children with FASD, compared with controls. Conclusions: These results indicate that cortisol levels are elevated throughout the day in children with FASD, possible due to increased basal levels and/or an increased response to daily stressors. Importantly, these results indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure has longterm effects on the HPA system in humans, which could increase vulnerability to mental health issues and chronic disease.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) may produce a range of physical, cognitive, neurological, and behavioral deficits. Those affected may also develop secondary disabilities later in life, which include a high incidence of depression and anxiety disorders. One potential mechanism that may mediate the connection between PAE and depressive/anxiety disorders is fetal programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), or stress, axis, by PAE. Previous work has shown that PAE reprograms the fetal HPA axis, resulting in increased HPA tone and hyper-reactivity (e.g. elevated corticosterone [CORT] and/or adrenocorticotropin [ACTH] levels) to subsequent stressors throughout life. Moreover, work from our lab found that exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS) produces, in a sexually dimorphic manner, greater depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in PAE than control rats. We hypothesized that the increased propensity to depressive/anxiety disorders in individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol may be related to the fact that stressors experienced over the life course act on a sensitized or hyperresponsive HPA axis. As such, it is proposed that normalizing HPA activity would attenuate some of the adverse effects of chronic stress on behavior and emotionality in PAE rats. Using our rat model of PAE, adult male and female offspring from prenatal alcohol (36% ethanol-derived calories), pairfed (nutritional control), and ad libitum-fed control groups underwent sham surgery or adrenalectomy (ADX) with replacement of CORT at low basal levels (25 ug/ml in males; 75 ug/ml in females) in drinking water (0.2% ethanol; 0.9% saline) at postnatal 55-65 days of age. Following recovery, animals were either exposed to CMS or left undisturbed (non-CMS). Animals were weighed on days 1 and 5 of CMS, and 1 day post- CMS, as a non-invasive measure of stress responsivity. Depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors were then assessed on the open field, elevated plus maze, and Porsolt forced swim tests. Plasma CORT levels prior to ADX, pre- and post-CMS exposure, and 30-min post-FST were measured. Preliminary findings indicate a sexually dimorphic effect of prenatal treatment and/or CMS on weight gain and a modulation of PAE- and/or stress-induced anxiety-like behavior following normalization of CORT levels. These findings suggest a role for HPA activity in mediating the effects of PAE and CMS on behavior.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is characterized by a range of deficits across the lifespan, including cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, such as impaired executive function and social behavior that may be exacerbated by postnatal stress. Our previous data suggest that social status in early life may impact cognitive performance in adulthood, with submissive PAE animals showing more errors on the radial arm maze (RAM) than controls. Moreover, poststress basal corticosterone (CORT) levels were shown to be positively correlated with mean total errors in a T-Maze task in PAE but not control or pair-fed, males and females. Although intact executive function may be a requirement for normal social behavior, the interplay between higher cognitive function and social behavior is complex, and more research investigating this relationship is needed. To investigate further the effects of social interaction on cognitive function, we evaluated the effects of adolescent stressful experience and adult social interactions in modulating cognitive function in PAE and control animals. Pregnant rat dams were assigned to: 1) PAE - liquid ethanol diet ad libitum; 2) Pair-fed (PF) - liquid control diet paired to PAE consumption; or 3) Control - lab chow ad libitum. To emulate postnatal exposure to stress, we utilized a chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm. In adulthood, rats were assessed on the Win-Shift task using an 8-arm RAM to evaluate executive function. Animals were first evaluated using a 20 min delay between training and testing. The next day, animals repeated the task with the introduction of an unfamiliar rat (social distractor) into the holding cage during the 20 min delay. Preliminary analysis indicates that errors were increased in PAE and PF females on the Win- Shift task. Moreover, the introduction of a social distracter during the 20 min delay increased the number of errors in animals from all groups. In males, however, no differences there were no effects of either prenatal group or presence of a social distractor on number of errors in the RAM. These data suggest sexually dimorphic effects of prenatal group and social test condition on executive function. Further analysis is needed to determine the role of changes in key brain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, in mediating the outcome observed.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with an increased incidence of psychopathology in children and adults. The aim of this study was to determine whether early indicators of affect disturbance are seen in infants exposed prenatally to alcohol. We hypothesized that (1) prenatal alcohol exposure is related to greater infant withdrawal and to alterations in infant temperament; (2) the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on withdrawal and temperament are independent of each other and independent of maternal depression and postnatal maternal alcohol use, and (3) the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on cognitive function at 5 years will be mediated, in part, by affective disturbance in infancy as assessed by withdrawal and temperament. The Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort consists of 159 mothers and infants from the Cape Coloured (mixed race) community in Cape Town, South Africa, a large proportion of whom were exposed to alcohol during gestation. Mothers were interviewed about their alcohol consumption using a timeline follow-back approach to determine frequency and amount of drinking on a day-by-day basis. The Alarm Distress Baby Scale (ADBB) of Guerdeney and Fermanian (2001), which assesses sustained affective withdrawal behaviour, was administered at 6.5 months postpartum, and the mothers were interviewed on the Buss and Plomin (1984) EAS Temperament scale at 13 months. At the 5-year follow-up, the Junior South African Intelligence Scales (IQ) assessment was administered, and the EAS interview was repeated. ADBB withdrawal was associated with reduced activity on the EAS (r = -.29, p < .01) but was not related to emotionality, shyness, or sociability. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with greater ADBB affective withdrawal (r = .30, p < .01) and lower EAS activity (r = -.23, p < .01). These effects were independent of each other, and both remained significant after controlling for postnatal maternal alcohol use and depression. Mediation of the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on 5-year IQ by the ADBB fell just short of statistical significance (Sobel z = -1.34, p = .085), suggesting that affective withdrawal that is already evident in infancy contributes to poorer cognitive function at school entry.

N2  - A key component of this NIAAA-funded study to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in the Western Cape Province of South Africa is to contact women on their first visit to the antenatal clinics for an assessment of drinking levels during their current pregnancy and therefore, the risk for producing a child with an FASD. Antenatal clinics are usually held over four days of each week in different locations in our prevention and comparison communities. Since late 2008 through June 2011, 2,550 women have been contacted and enrolled. Seventy-nine percent of the women were "Coloured" (a proper South African term meaning of mixed racial ancestry), 18% were Black, and 3% were White. Generally, these women were extremely positive and open to the brief intervention about the risks of drinking during their pregnancy. In fact, the women who attend these clinics are used to long periods of waiting, and very little time is actually spent with health care workers. The fact that our staff spent time with these women made the women feel special, and the individual attention given to everyone contributed to the success of these efforts. Two instruments are used to assess the use or abuse of alcohol, the Alcohol Use Questionnaire (AUDIT), and the Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ). After completing the assessment tools, any risky drinking behavior was discussed with the women in a non-judgmental manner, and every woman was motivated by receiving factual, prevention information and informed that stopping drinking at any time during the pregnancy would benefit their baby. In the prevention community, if a woman was consuming alcohol in a risky manner, our staff member invited the women to become involved in the case management component of our study. Women in the comparison communities are referred to Provincial health officials or non-governmental organizations. Data analysis continues.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are caused by the deleterious effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. FASD's are the most common environmentally induced form of mental retardation in the world, potentially affecting 1% of all children born in the United States. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most clinically recognizable form of FASD and is characterized by a pattern of minor facial anomalies, prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, and functional or structural central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. However, the effects of alcohol on the developing fetus represent a continuum, with full-blown FAS merely the "tip of the iceberg." The highest documented prevalence of FAS in the world has been documented to be 80 per 1,000 in the mixed race population of the Western Cape Province in South Africa. The consequences of FASD are life long, and the behavioral and learning difficulties are often greater than the degree of neurocognitive impairment. Thus, early diagnosis and referral for early intervention services is imperative. However, while application of diagnostic guidelines for FASD in older children and adolescents can be difficult, diagnosis in the infant is rarely attempted because of the lack of documented specificity of the phenotype in the newborn. Yet, identification and referral within the first few months of life may represent the most crucial time in the affected child's lifespan for initiation of early intervention services. Between October 2008 and May 2011 NIAAA-funded researchers investigated predictors of FASD and developmental outcome in early infancy in a cohort of 965 alcohol-exposed and unexposed infants prospectively ascertained during pregnancy. We utilized three methodologies to approach this issue: growth and standardized dysmorphology assessment of subjects and controls at birth, 6 weeks, 9 months and 18 month intervals, respectively; standardized developmental assessments (using age appropriate assessment tools) at the same intervals; and digital photography at each interval.

N2  - Purpose: The Hawai'i Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Task Force was initiated less than a decade ago as a primary entity to help plan, guide, facilitate, and oversee statewide initiatives in the education and awareness, screening, identification, prevention, interventions, and services related to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. An historical assessment of the Task Force activities was conducted to map the challenges and progress made in the goal of building a comprehensive statewide system for FASD. Method: Archived documents from the Task Force and the Hawai'i Department of Health were examined, (e.g., PRAMS and Birth Defects Reports), and informal face-to-face or phone interviews were conducted (e.g., State FASD Coordinator, other agency collaborators). These sources provided quantitative and qualitative information about the Task Force's planned or prioritized, and implemented activities, as well as the major outcomes, challenges, and successes. Results: Though an iterative process, the Task Force has conducted needs assessments, strategic planning, and prioritized inter-agency and multi-sectoral collaborative activities, reflecting incremental gains in expanding initiatives in prevention, screening, public awareness, and education and training over time. The creation of a State FASD Coordinator position within the past several years was significant in catalyzing increased and sustained support for FASD initiatives and extending collaborative networks with national experts/teams, community-based organizations, and other local agencies to leverage resources in a time of economic strain. Needs assessments by the state and other community data indicate that prenatal alcohol use is significant, and that health, educational, and social services seek education and training opportunities to address the issues of FASDs in practice. Recent efforts have looked to develop or enhance foundations in a systematic and collaborative approach for currently challenging areas such as data and surveillance, research, and education and training to help improve screening, identification and prevention systems. Conclusion: A strategic and informed approach to building a statewide comprehensive system can become an iterative and resource-dependent process. Key leadership, stakeholder commitment and support, and prioritization by the state is essential in order to continue to make progress and drive policy directions to reduce and prevent FASDs in Hawai'i.

N2  - South Africa has the highest recorded prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in the world. Caused by maternal drinking, FAS is preventable and characterized by unique facial features, growth retardation, and developmental delays. Case management (CM) can help women access resources needed to reduce drinking or increase abstention from alcohol during pregnancy. In this study, CM is designed to determine whether the rate of FASD can be reduced over time, focusing on indicated prevention to provide support to women who are known to drink heavily during pregnancy. CM was implemented by trained project officers using Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) techniques to encourage positive changes in drinking habits. MI is a person-centred therapy that elicits and strengthens motivation for change. CRA is an evidence-based behavioral approach for treating substance abuse problems to assist clients in maintaining a sober lifestyle. Data for the initial participants (n = 30; 97% Coloured, 3% Black) indicated risk factors commonly associated with maternal drinking and FASD, including young age at time of pregnancy (= 24.3 years), low education (= < 8th grade), low religiousity (> 33% report never attending church), and unemployment (>75% do not work for money). The majority (69%) of the sample report that half or more of their current friends drink alcohol. Ninety percent believed they were pregnant at the time of intake. Nearly half (48%) report their lives to be very or extremely stressful, and at intake, nearly half (42% a very high percentage in this South African population) believed they currently had a drinking problem. Mean AUDIT scores show significant improvement from baseline to 6 month follow-up (20.3 down to 9.7). Measures for total drinks consumed on weekends, total drinks over the past seven days, and total number of drinking days in the past week, were also reduced. Results show the efficacy of CM, while also showing the difficulty of making enduring change in an environment where weekend drinking for recreation and sociability remains popular. CM for prevention is useful to help women abstain or reduce their alcohol intake during pregnancy. Data gathering and analysis continues.

N2  - In general, females in Asian countries consume less alcohol than those from Western countries although alcohol consumption among females in Korea have been increasing. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a serious consequence of drinking during pregnancy and little information is available on the rates of FAS in Asian countries. This study estimated the prevalence of FAS in South Korea using an active case ascertainment approach in two different settings, general schools (N=12) and institutions for children with intellectual disability (N=8). Within the general schools 7,785 children were screened on height and weight and those falling under the 10th percentile were selected for subsequent physical examination (n=224), including a dysmorphology assessment. Intellectual function and attention capabilities were examined by utilizing a standardized neurocognitive test, WISC-III(Wechsler Inteligence Scale for Children, 3th ed.)and computerized continuous performance test. Parental interviews were conducted to obtain information about maternal drinking history. In the institutional settings, physical exams, including the dysmorphology assessment were performed on all children. In the general schools the prevalence of FAS was 0.28%, whereas in the institutions for intellectual disability the prevalence was 14.9%. These rates are not dissimilar to those reported in western countries. These data extend extremely limited studies on the prevalence of FAS in S. Korea and demonstrate the need for increased screening and diagnoses of FAS in various community and clinical settings.

N2  - Purpose: As alcohol is the most preventable cause of intellectual disability in the USA, dissemination of effective interventions to prevent AEP is critical. CHOICES, a motivational interviewing (MI) based intervention with women at risk of an AEP, was proven efficacious in randomized, controlled trials in a variety of settings. CDC has sponsored demonstration projects to determine if and how this research can be translated into practice in populations with high rates of alcohol use and pregnancy. CHOICES was part of the completed FASPACE Stepped Care project in Colorado, and is the basis of STD-CHOICES, currently underway in Denver and Baltimore STD clinics. Methods: The CHOICES intervention comprises 2 face to face counseling sessions and 1 booster call after each session, with follow-up obtained 3 and 6 months after session 1. Eligible participants are reproductive age, heterosexually active women drinking at high-risk levels (4 or more drinks on 1 occasion or 8 or more drinks weekly), and not using effective contraception. Using MI techniques, including a decisional balance exercise and importance/ readiness/confidence rulers, the Interventionist helps the woman set goals for alcohol and/or contraceptive use that would lower AEP risk. Reduced risk for AEP is defined as reducing drinking below high-risk levels, using effective contraception, or both. FAS-PACE used Public Health nurses, social workers, and substance abuse counselors (CAC) who went to a variety of settings including food banks, probation offices, WIC offices, domestic violence shelters, and colleges in four counties. STD-CHOICES in Baltimore uses a social worker in the Druid Clinic. Denver uses a CAC and Medical Assistants, in the Denver Metro Health Clinic. The social worker and a patient navigator screen in Baltimore, clinicians screen in Denver. MI experts trained all Interventionists. Results: FAS-PACE obtained follow-up on 85/244 women, with 86% at reduced risk of AEP at both 3 and 6 months. For the STD-CHOICES sites, follow-ups and % at reduced risk at 3 and 6 months are: Baltimore 59/113, 64% and 74%; Denver 40/81, 81% and 83%. Conclusions: Preliminary results from these CDC demonstration projects indicate the CHOICES intervention can be implemented successfully using different models of venue, screening and personnel delivering the intervention, suggesting that agencies working with women to reduce risk of AEP will be able to choose a model to fit their resources.

N2  - The role that micronutrients play in ameloriating the negative impact of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) was explored in a randomized clinical trial conducted in Rivne, Ukraine. To assess neurodevelopmental outcome, cardiac orienting responses (ORs) during an information processing paradigm were obtained from 12-18 mo old infants. Methods: Women who differed in prenatal alcohol use were recruited during pregnancy and randomized to group: None, Multivitamin/Minerals (M/M), and Multivitamin/Minerals plus Choline (M/M + Choline). The habituation stimuli were presented for 10 trials and the dishabituation stimulus were presented for 5 trials. The responses to the habituation stimuli reflect encoding and responses to the dishabituation stimulus reflect the additional use of memory skills. Heart rate (HR) was collected at a rate of 1000 samples per sec and then aggregated by sec. Baseline HR was collected for 30 sec prior to stimulus onset and then 9 sec post-stimulus onset from which difference values were computed for analysis for the first 3 trials of each condition. Results: A repeated measures analysis of covariance was used. The between subjects factors were PAE (yes or no) and intervention group (None, M/M, or M/M+Choline). The within subjects factors included stimulus (auditory or visual), condition (habituation or dishabituation), trial (1-3), and second (1-9). Covariates were child's age and baseline HR. Between subjects effects included a significant intervention effect (F (2,54)=4.693, p < .013) and a trend for an interaction effect between intervention and history of PAE (F (2, 54)=3.03, p < .057). Post hoc comparisons indicated that those in the M/M+ Choline group had greater (p < .001) HR deceleration (HRD=6.8) as compared to the None group (HRD=1.6). A trend (p < .087) was found for the M/M (HRD=3.1) being lower than the M/M+ Choline group but this group did not differ from the None group. Relative to the interaction, among those without PAE, those in the M/M+ Choline performed better than those in both other groups. Among those with PAE, both intervention groups performed better than the no intervention group but did not differ from each other. Conclusion: Preliminary analysis suggested that choline supplementation during pregnancy may provide beneficial impact to offspring's encoding and memory functioning regardless of PAE and multivitamin supplementation alone may provide a beneficial impact to infants with PAE.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can significantly damage the developing brain. Because the exact nature of the damage can depend upon the amount consumed, and the time it is consumed during the pregnancy, the damage can manifest in wide array of disorders that are grouped under the term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). One problem consistently observed in FASD is an impairment in learning and memory processes, particularly those that involve the functioning of the hippocampal formation. Experimentally we can study deficits caused by FASD by looking at long-term potentiation (LTP), a biological model of learning and memory that is easily observed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In this study we have observed deficits in LTP in anaesthetized adult males that have been exposed to alcohol prenatally. Biochemical analyses of the brains of these animals revealed that these deficits in LTP were also accompanied by reductions in neuronal antioxidants; in particular glutathione. To try and ameliorate the deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, we gave animals' access to a diet supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for membrane fluidity and participate in many signaling cascades in the brain. They are also associated with preventing neurocognitive decline, decreasing inflammation, and reducing indications of depression. In the present study we show that Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in FASD newborns completely rescues deficits in LTP and increases glutathione levels into adulthood. Furthermore, glutathione depletion itself can mimic the effects of FASD for LTP, indicating that a reduction in glutathione alone can significantly impair the functional capacity of synapses. These results indicate that omega-3 fatty acids may be an important addition to the diet of children suffering from FASD and may be able to "rescue" the deficits in learning and memory common with this disorder.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol has been linked to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) which encompasses various developmental deficits, including cardinal brain retardation. Although many mechanisms (e. g. oxidative stress, apoptosis) have been studied, how alcohol leads to neurodevelopmental disorders remains elusive. We have recently proposed that alcohol, acting as a methyl donor suppressor, interferes with DNA methylation, which we have further demonstrated to play a permissive role during neural tube differentiation. This study aims to examine the role of the DNA methylation in cerebellar development and the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure. Using a mouse model of prenatal alcohol exposure (liquid, 4% v/v, administered across gestational period E7-17, pups reared by surrogate foster mothers) as well as isocaloric pair-fed and control animals, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of the DNA methylation marker 5-methylcytosine (5meC) and a recently identified derivative, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) across critical periods of postnatal cerebellar development (P7, P21, P28). We observed that the methylation of two major classes of cells, Purkinje and granule, are unique and transition through methylation and de-methylation states across development. Additionally, subpopulations of granule cells exhibit distinct DNA Methylation Programs, or DMPs, relative to their mitotic and migrational status (P7). Alcohol has been previously shown to delay migration of granule cells from the external layer to their internal layer position. The results of our alcohol treatment further show that granule cell DMP is concordantly hindered. Taken together our study concludes that the DMP of the cerebellum is timely and cell-specific and can be altered by moderate fetal alcohol exposure. Further, this study suggests a novel mechanism for the inhibited migration of granule cells of the cerebellum upon fetal alcohol exposure and provides support for the idea that alcohol can exploit epigenetic machinery to alter transcriptional regulation during neurodevelopment-a focus of our forthcoming work.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) both have effects on adaptive behavior in children. Although several studies have compared children with AE or ADHD, no study has examined the interaction between these two factors on adaptive functioning. The current study examined this interaction by including children with and without AE and ADHD. Methods: As part of a multisite study, primary caregivers of 318 children (8-16y, M=12.36) completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II). Four subject groups were included: with AE and ADHD (AE+, n = 78), with AE but without ADHD (AE-, n = 37), nonexposed with ADHD (ADHD, n = 71), and nonexposed without ADHD (CON, n = 132). VABS-II domain scores (Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization) were analyzed using three, 2 (AE) X 2 (ADHD diagnosis) between-subjects ANCOVAs, with Age included as a model covariate. Results: There were significant main effects of AE (p < .001) and ADHD (p < .001) on Communication, Daily Living Skills, and Socialization domains. For all domain scores, children with AE had lower scores than those without AE and children with ADHD had lower domain scores than those without ADHD. Age was a significant covariate (p < .01) in all analyses. There was a significant AE X ADHD interaction [F (1, 310) = 7.76, p = .006] effect for Communication scores, but not Daily Living Skills or Socialization domains (p > .40). The AE+ group had lower Communication scores than the AE- (p < .001) and ADHD (p < .001) groups, which did not differ from each other. All three clinical groups had lower Communication scores than the CON group (p < .001). Conclusion: Consistent with previous studies, both AE and ADHD elevate the risk of adaptive dysfunction. However, AE exacerbates the effect of ADHD on communication abilities in children, whereby children with both AE and ADHD have significantly poorer outcomes than those with either condition alone. These results further demonstrate the unique effects of AE on this functional domain and support the use of specialized clinical services in this population.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) results in facial memory impairments. The present study examined whether deficits are (1) attributed to encoding or retrieval and (2) are accounted for by spatial abilities. Methods: Subjects were children (5-16y, M=10.90) with AE (n = 48) and typically developing controls (CON, n = 48). Facial memory was tested using NEPSY-II Immediate and Delayed Memory for Faces (MF) and visuospatial processing (VP) was tested using NEPSY-II Design Copy (DC) and Geometric Puzzles (GP). Group differences on MF were examined using a 2 (Group) X 2 (MF Condition) repeated measures ANOVA. To evaluate the contribution of visuospatial abilities, 2 hierarchical regressions were analyzed with Group and VP subtest entered as step 1 predictors, and the Group x VP subtest interaction entered as a step 2 predictor. Results: The AE group was significantly (p<.05) worse than CON on both MF conditions, but there was no significant Group X Condition interaction. Given no differences between memory conditions, only immediate MF was pursued. For DC, regression analyses revealed that step 1 (VP and Group) accounted for a significant (p=.012) amount of variance in MF performance. Specifically, DC significantly predicted MF across all groups (p=.030). However, step 2 (interactions) did not result in a significant increase in explained variance. For GP, regression analyses revealed that step 1 accounted for a marginally significant (p=.061) amount of variance in MF performance but neither group nor GP was a significant predictor of MF. Step 2 resulted in a marginally significant increase in explained variance (DR2=.075). Specifically, the Group X GP interaction was marginally significant (p=.075). Conclusion: The results support previous findings of deficits on measures of facial memory in children with AE but suggested that these deficits require additional study. Specifically, the finding that there were no differences between immediate and delayed conditions indicates that deficits in facial memory may be due to encoding rather than retention deficits. Additionally, these results suggest that deficits are not specifically due to impairments in facial memory per se in children with AE, but are better accounted for by factors such as learning and visuospatial processing.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are characterized by attention deficits. The current study examined the nature and specificity of these deficits by comparing performance of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) to non-exposed controls using a measure based on a strong theoretical model of attention functioning (e.g., Posner et al., 2006). Methods: Subjects (8-12y, M=10.99) comprised two groups: children with AE (N=27) and typically developing controls (CON, N=26). Groups were matched on age, sex, handedness, race/ethnicity, and SES. Subjects were administered the attention network test, a computerized task that examines three independent but interrelated networks of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Data were analyzed using a 2 (group) x 3 (network) repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Results indicate that children with AE were impaired on alerting and executive control aspects of attention. Omnibus tests revealed significant main effects of network (F (2,102) = 12.89, p < .001) and a network X group interaction (F (2,102)= 3.89, p = .024). The main effect of group was not significant (F (1,51) = 0.28, p = .560). Pairwise comparisons indicated that the AE group was significantly worse on alerting (p = .035) and marginally worse on executive control (p = .052) networks than the CON group. There were no group differences on orienting attention in this sample (p = .821). In addition, as a preliminary investigation, a small group of subjects with ADHD were tested and compared to children with AE. These limited data suggest that the two clinical groups can be differentiated on executive control of attention (p = .050) but were similar on the orienting and alerting networks. Conclusion: Findings suggest that children with AE are impaired in distinct aspects of attention function. Specifically, children with AE show impairment in alerting and executive control attention networks. Evaluation of underlying mechanisms of attention allows for greater understanding of brain regions affected by AE and suggests that areas in the frontal and parietal cortical sites (alerting) and areas in the cingulate gyrus and some lateral prefrontal areas (executive control) might be especially affected in these children.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are characterized by attention deficits. The current study examined the nature and specificity of these deficits by comparing neural activation of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) to non-exposed controls during a measure based on a strong theoretical model of attention functioning (e.g., Posner et al., 2006). Method: Subjects (13-16y, M=15.10) comprised two groups: children with AE (N=24) and typically developing controls (CON, N=9). Groups were matched on age, sex, handedness, race/ethnicity, and SES. During fMRI, subjects were administered the attention network test, a computerized task that examines three independent but interrelated networks of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Data were analyzed using independent sample ttests. Results: Groups did not differ on task accuracy; however, the CON had overall faster reaction times compared to the AE group (p < .05). Statistically significant group differences in BOLD response were observed in all three attention networks (cluster size > 1,000 microl; p < .05). In the alerting network, the CON group showed greater BOLD response than the AE group in the bilateral superior/middle and inferior temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and left postcentral gyrus, whereas, the AE group showed greater BOLD response in regions of the medial frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and right paracentral lobule. In the orienting network, the AE group had greater activation mainly in areas of the inferior and middle frontal gyri and the middle temporal gyrus. During the executive network condition the CON group had greater activation in parietal regions, while children in the AE group showed greater activation in the cuneus, posterior cingulate, superior and middle temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Conclusions: Results support prior findings suggesting that attention may be particularly sensitive to the teratogenic effects of AE and further indicate that distinct neural mechanisms underlie the attention network in children with AE compared to nonexposed typically developing peers. In the majority of the clusters, children in AE group showed greater activation, which may result from atypical neuroadaptive processes or brain alterations.

N2  - Background: The current study examined whether a measure of cognitive activity, based on pupillary response during a cognitive measure of attention, could be used to accurately identify children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) from non-exposed controls. Methods: Subjects (8-12y, M=10.99) comprised two groups: children with AE (N=27) and typically developing controls (CON, N=26). Groups were matched on age, sex, handedness, race/ethnicity, and SES. Subjects were administered the attention network test, a computerized task that examines three independent but interrelated networks of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive control. During this testing, all subjects were eyetracked and a pupil-based measure of cognitive effort, the Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA), was obtained. Results: ICA and reaction time (RT) data for the three network contrasts were calculated and data were analyzed using discriminant function analysis (DFA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). DFA results revealed that the combination of 3 ICA scores and 3 RT scores could be used to accurately classify subjects (p < .05). Overall classification accuracy was 77% (78% AE, 77% CON). The results of the MANOVA revealed a significant effect of group, F (6,46) = 2.29, p = .05, supporting the DFA. In addition, as a preliminary investigation, a small group of subjects with ADHD were tested and compared to children with AE. These limited data suggest that the two clinical groups can be accurately classified (p < .05). Overall classification accuracy was 73% (78% AE, 68% ADHD). Conclusion: Findings suggest that ICA differs in children with AE and controls and can be used to distinguish these groups. Thus, this measure may have clinical utility in the diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals. Additional examination of ICA over time (rather than network) may provide additional information. Preliminary findings also indicate that additional studies comparing ICA data for subjects with AE and ADHD may help further distinguish these groups.

N2  - Background: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) have deficits in theory of mind (ToM); the ability to attribute mental states to others. Multiple abilities impact ToM performance including visuospatial processing (VP) and affect recognition (AR). Studies have also reported the influence of VP on AR, suggesting a relation between AR and ToM that is influenced by VP. The purpose of this study was to determine if a relation between AR and ToM existed in alcohol-exposed children, to assess if VP mediated this association, and understand potential differences between clinical groups. Methods: Children (7-16 years old) completed the NEPSY-II. Subjects consisted of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, n=46), non-exposed children with ADHD (ADHD, n=24), and typically developing children (CON, n=40). The Baron and Kenny method of mediation measured the mediating effect of VP on the relation between AR and ToM within groups. Thus, linear regression was used to test if: AR predicted VP (path A), AR predicted ToM (path B), VP predicted ToM (path C), VP decreased or eliminated significance between AR and ToM when included as a mediator (path C'). Results: With age and sex as covariates, the omnibus mediation test revealed that paths A-C were significant and that VP served as a partial mediator between AR and ToM (path C'). Further, within-group analyses with covariates indicated that paths A-C were significant for the AE and CON groups. Moreover, VP served as a total mediator for the relation between AR and ToM (path C') solely in the AE group, with a partial mediating effect present for the CON group. Path B was not significant in the ADHD group, suggesting no VP mediating effect for ADHD children as the predictor and outcome variables were not associated. Conclusions: The current study showed differences in the relations between AR, VP and ToM between groups. As with previous studies, AR and ToM were associated in all groups, but VP proved to have significant (and total) mediating effect only for the AE group suggesting a unique relation between these factors in alcohol-exposed children. In addition, these results were significant beyond the influence of age and sex, which have been shown to influence ToM. Thus, these results may reflect differential effects of development across the groups, which may help discriminate clinical profiles.

N2  - To assess neurodevelopmental outcome associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), cardiac orienting responses (ORs) were assessed during habituation/dishabituation information processing paradigms with 12-18 mo old infants. Methods: The subset of participants who were assigned to no intervention from an on-going randomized clinical trial study, carried out in Rivne, Ukraine, on the impact of micronutrient supplements were used. Auditory and visual stimuli were presented in 10 habituation and 5 dishabituation trials. The responses to the habituation stimuli reflect encoding and responses to the dishabituation stimulus reflect the additional use of memory skills. Heart rate (HR) was aggregated by sec. Baseline HR was collected for 30 sec prior to stimulus onset and then 9 sec post-stimulus from which difference values were computed over the first 3 trials of each condition. Results: Using a repeated measures analysis of covariance, the between subjects factor was PAE (yes or no) and the within subjects factors were stimulus (auditory or visual), condition (habituation or dishabituation), trial (1-3), and second (1-9). Covariates were child's age and baseline HR. A significant PAE by sec interaction effect was found (F (8,232) = 2.21, p < .027). HR decelerations were significantly less among those with a positive history of PAE as compared to those without PAE on sec 1-5 and 9 but did not differ on sec 6-8. This effect was modified by the nature of the stimulus (Stimulus*PAE*Second Interaction: F (8,232)= 2.09, p <.037) with PAE having greater deficits in their response to the visual stimuli than the auditory and by the learning condition (Condition*Stimulus*PAE*Second Interaction: F (8, 232)=3.82, p < .000) with the effect being stronger in the habituation rather than the dishabituation trials. Conclusion. PAE adversely impacts neurophysiological encoding and memory of environmental events. The rate of deceleration, as indicated by the differences in HR changes over time, was adversely affected by a history of PAE despite the groups not differing during the peak trough interval, where maximum HR decelerations typically occur. This pattern of responses reflects a delay in encoding the environmental events and occurred regardless of the nature of the stimulus and the learning condition (habituation or dishabituation) but ORs were more negatively impacted by PAE when using the visual stimuli and during habituation.

N2  - Verbal and visuospatial learning and memory have been extensively studied in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Previous studies have shown deficits in learning in both domains. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamics of verbal and visuospatial learning in children with FASD from Cape Town, South Africa. The sample was comprised of 59 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) children who are participating in the 9-year follow-up of a longitudinal FASD study, comprised of children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (PFAS), heavy exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children, and controls. Children were administered a visuospatial associative learning test and the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), a test of episodic learning. Learning rates were estimated by fitting negatively accelerated response functions (y=1-e-kx) to each child's performance across trials on each learning task. Significant differences in learning rate were found on the CVLT-C [F(2, 51) = 5.03; p < .01] with those in the FAS/PFAS and HE groups showing slower learning rates than controls (both ps < .05). A marginally significant difference in learning rate was found on the visuospatial associative learning task [F(2, 49) = 3.01; p = .059] with those in the FAS/PFAS group having slower learning rates than the HE group (p < .05). Significant differences in peak performance (capacity) were found on the CVLT-C [F(2, 51) = 5.83; p < .01] with those in the FAS/PFAS and HE groups showing less learning capacity than controls (both ps < .05). No exposure group differences in capacity were found on the visuospatial associative learning task [F(2,49) = 0.15; n.s.]. These data indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure affects learning rates similarly in both tasks, but only episodic learning capacity is vulnerable, while associative learning is spared. The finding of deficits in learning rates in both tasks suggests a non-specific impairment in information processing and integration related to prenatal alcohol exposure. The finding that capacity was affected on the episodic recall task suggests that fetal alcohol exposure may affect the interaction of hippocampal and frontal regions, which is necessary for episodic recall. No capacity deficits were found on the associative learning task, which is primarily dependent on hippocampal activity alone.

N2  - Cognitive impairment in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is most severe in children who meet diagnostic criteria for full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), but significant deficits are also seen in non-syndromal heavily-exposed (HE) children. Using fMRI, we recently found differences in working memory-related cortico-striatal-cerebellar activation between syndromal and non-syndromal alcohol-exposed children (Diwadkar et al., 2012). But effects on regional brain interactions have not previously been investigated in FASD. In this study, we used psycho-physiological interaction (Friston et al., 1997), a seed-based method for assessing modulatory interactions between brain regions. We hypothesized that prenatal alcohol exposure would affect the degree to which the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), an important cognitive control region, modulates activity in fronto-striatal-cerebellar regions known to mediate working memory. A verbal 1-back task was administered to 47 children (17 with FAS/PFAS, 13 HE, and 17 controls; age 8.9-10.6 yr). In the 1-back condition, the child presses the left key if the letter appearing on the screen is the same as the previous letter; the right key, if it is not. In 0-back, s/he presses the left key to the letter D; otherwise, the right. Time series from the dACC (p<.05, effects of interest) were convolved with the psychological contrast of interest (1-back > 0-back) to investigate modulatory effects of the dACC. Inter-group differences were evaluated in a second level analysis of variance. When compared with controls, the FAS/PFAS group showed significantly greater modulation by the dACC of several brain regions known to mediate working memory, including dorsal prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Similar, albeit somewhat weaker, effects were seen in the HE group. These data suggest that fetal alcohol exposure disrupts the efficiency of cortico-striatal-cerebellar function, so that greater modulation by a key executive control region is required to perform a simple 1-back task. This increased executive control may constitute a compensatory mechanism for functional deficits in the regions that mediate working memory.

N2  - Purpose: Building on the Miller & Spear (2006) model of developmental and transgenerational risk for alcohol abuse and alcoholism, we assessed associatively learned responses to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) as a teratogenic neurobehavioral outcome in older teens/young adults. Based on preclinical research (e.g., Molina et al, 1995; Chotro et al, 2007) and research on mothers and children (e.g., Faas et al, 2000; Mennella & Beauchamp, 1998), we hypothesized that PAE leads to positive associations with alcohol which enhance later recognition and perceived intensity or pleasantness of alcohol's sensory characteristics (odor) by older teens. Methods: At 19 yrs, 75 participants were identified from our longitudinal prospectively identified cohort. Odor recognition ability was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (Doty, 2008). Responses to alcohol odors were examined via selfreport of perceived "pleasantness" and intensity, and correct identification of various alcohol and non-alcohol odors. PAE was assessed retrospectively at a 14-yr teen visit when mothers were again queried about their drinking during the same pregnancy. Relation between PAE and teen responses to alcohol odors were examined using multiple regression controlling for other prenatal exposures and multiple maternal/caregiver variables: custody status, age at conception, marital status, education, IQ, psychopathology; environment: SES, home quality, number of children in home; and teen factors: gender and age at testing. Variables were entered into the regression in this order: covariates and other prenatal exposures followed by PAE. Results: Even after controlling for multiple potential predictors of teen alcohol use, retrospective PAE significantly predicted teen ratings of alcohol odor pleasantness (b=.39, p<.01). Of the other odors, only tap water pleasantness was related significantly to PAE (b=.32, p<.05). PAE was not related to odor recognition or rated intensity. Conclusions: Controlled analysis from our prospective longitudinal cohort demonstrated that PAE is related to teen responses to alcohol odors, and not to other odors. This finding supports our hypothesis that positive associations to the chemosensory properties of alcohol are learned prenatally. Future analyses will examine how teen odor responses may be related to alcohol preference, alcohol-seeking, and high-risk alcohol-related behaviors in teens.

N2  - The idea that exposure to adverse environmental conditions and lifestyle choices during pregnancy can result in fetal programming that underlies disease susceptibility in adulthood is now widely accepted. One area that has not been well studied is the impact of maternal alcohol abuse on the offspring's susceptibility to cancer. We have recently shown that fetal alcohol exposure altered mammary gland morphology with a characteristic of the hyperproliferative state prior to puberty. When fetal alcohol exposed rats were treated with a carcinogen, they showed a higher incidence of mammary tumors and progressed more frequently to a malignant phenotype. We hypothesized that higher cancer incidence in fetal alcohol exposed offspring might be a result of an abnormality in the physiological process(s) that prevents cancer development. It has been suggested that the effect of stress on the immune system may in turn affect the growth of some tumors. We have previously shown that a set of hormone secreting nerve cells in the hypothalamus, called beta-endorphin (BEP) neurons, plays a role in regulating stress response and immune function. Hence, we tested whether fetal alcohol exposure increases the incidence of tumor colonization of a breast adenocarcinoma cell line, and whether transplantation of BEP neurons affects tumor colonization in these fetal alcohol exposed rats. Pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats were fed with rat chow (Ad Lib), alcohol containing diet (Alcohol-fed), or an isocaloric liquid diet (Pair-fed). Their female offspring were transplanted with either BEP neurons or cortical cells as control. They were then inoculated with MADB106 cells in the jugular vein. Animals were sacrificed 4 weeks later and tumor granules in the lungs were counted. After tumor inoculation, fetal alcohol exposed rat had more tumor colonization in the lung comparing to ad lib and pair-fed animals. BEP transplantation reduced the stress hormone level of fetal alcohol exposed rats, and significantly prevented the appearance of tumor granules in the lung of control animals as well as fetal alcohol exposed animals. These data can be interpreted as preliminary evidence that a loss of BEP control of cancer cell clearance may be a cause for the increased cancer susceptibility in fetal alcohol animals. Furthermore, the data identify the potential use of BEP cell therapy for breast cancer prevention.

N2  - An average of 12% of women still consume ethanol during pregnancy despite alcohol's known teratogenicity. (Floyd et al. 2009) The myriad of cognitive deficits, including reduced fetal and adult neurogenesis resulting from alcohol exposure, have been well characterized. (Gil- Mohapel et al. 2011; Uban et al. 2010) Adult neurogenesis is thought to play a vital role in hippocampal-dependent modes of learning and memory and is quite sensitive to extrinsic factors including alcohol. (Shors et al. 2011) We have shown deficits in adult neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks after prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in mice. (Choi et al. 2005) Our exposure model involves voluntary drinking four hours per day throughout pregnancy resulting in average BEC of 68.5 +/- 9.2 mg/dl after two hours drinking, increasing to 88.3 +/- 11.5 mg/dl after four hours of drinking. (Brady et al. 2011) New data collected from our lab show deficits in context discrimination after this moderate exposure paradigm. While the link between PAE and learning and memory deficits is clear, the mechanism remains elusive. We hypothesize that this mechanism is epigenetic in nature and that PAE disrupts epigenetic machinery necessary for appropriately timed DNA methylation and histone modifications regulating neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Here, we show that the mRNA levels of several genes involved in epigenetic regulation, including histone demethylases and methyltransferases, are aberrant in hippocampi derived from PAE PD35 mice. For example, the fold regulation in histone 3 lysine demethlyases ranges from )1.32 to )1.67 with significance as low as 0.01 for some genes. Our preliminary protein data qualitatively shows changes in DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b concentrations in PAE PD35 mice. These DNA methyltransferases play a key role in the timing, maintenance, and differentiation of neural progenitor cells in fetal neurogenesis (Sun et al. 2011); however, no studies have shown their role in adult neurogenesis with prenatal alcohol exposure. While studies have looked at the overall effects of alcohol on methyl-donor synthesis in the DNA methylation story (Zhou et al. 2011), our study is the first to look at the DNA methylation machinery itself for aberrant expression in the hippocampi of mice prenatally exposed to alcohol.

N2  - Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, one of the major regulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, immune functions and energy homeostasis, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of fetal alcohol exposure. This vulnerability is manifested by hypermethylation of POMC gene promoter with a deficit in POMC gene expression and a decrease in protein levels of its derived opioid peptide beta-endorphin. We previously demonstrated that fetal alcohol exposure significantly decreased the protein levels of the activation mark H3K4me3 and increased the protein levels of the repressive mark H3K9me2 in beta-endorphin-producing POMC neurons. In this study, we specifically investigated if this deficit in gene expression and beta-endorphin peptide production is also mediated by modulation of histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 along POMC gene in fetal alcohol exposed offspring. The spatial distribution of histone marks along a gene body plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and gene expression. We found by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) that fetal alcohol exposure from gestational days GD7- GD21 decreased in exposed male and female adult rats the occupancy of H3K4me3 along Exon 3 of POMC gene. Although the level of H3K9me2 was higher in alcohol exposed rats compared to controls, the occupancy of this mark was low and did not change significantly along Exon 3 or along POMC gene promoter in control and treated rats. Interestingly, the occupancy of the mutually exclusive histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 changed in opposite direction as expected along Exon 3 of POMC gene. Overall, this study shows a distinctive spatial distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 along POMC gene that reflects the modulation of POMC chromatin landscape in response to prenatal alcohol exposure. The reduction of H3K4me3 along Exon 3 of POMC gene could modulate the efficiency of Exon 3 splicing. This could be one of the causes of the decrease in generation of functional POMC transcripts and in production of functional beta-endorphin peptides from hypothalamic POMC gene.

N2  - Purpose: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine annual trends in the prevalence of any alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant and non-pregnant women aged 18-44 between 2006 and 2010. Additionally, patterns of binge episodes and maximum alcoholic beverages consumed on a single occasion were explored. Methods: Five years of data, collected from 2006 through 2010, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were combined and analyzed. The study population included 13,880 pregnant and 331,196 non-pregnant women aged 18-44. Annual and fiveyear prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking (defined as four or more drinks on one occasion) in the past 30 days were calculated for pregnant and non-pregnant women. The average number of binge drinking episodes and the average maximum number of drinks consumed on one occasion in the past 30 days among binge drinkers were also estimated. Results: The estimated prevalence of any alcohol use from 2006-2010 among pregnant women and non-pregnant women was 7.6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 6.9-8.4) and 51.5% (95% CI = 51.2-51.8), respectively. The estimated prevalence of binge drinking from 2006-2010 among pregnant women and non-pregnant women was 1.1% (95% CI = 0.8-1.4) and 13.5% (95% CI = 13.2-13.7), respectively. There was little annual change in either set of prevalence estimates over the five years of data collection. The reported average number of binge drinking episodes was only slightly lower among pregnant women compared to nonpregnant women (2.5 vs. 3.0, respectively). The average maximum number of alcoholic beverages consumed on one occasion was found to be 6.2 drinks among both pregnant and non-pregnant women who binge. Conclusion: The relatively stable prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking from 2006 to 2010 among women of childbearing age indicate that continued efforts are necessary to address this public health concern and further reduce FASD risk. Women who binge drink appear to binge with similar frequency and intensity, regardless of pregnancy status. Women who binge drink are an important population for targeted interventions. Increasing screening and brief intervention may help to address this issue.

N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy causes to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), with varying degrees of neurodevelopment deficits. Proper DNA methylation which regulates gene repression is now known as a prerequisite for zygote differentiation, early development, tissue specification. We previously reported that DNA methylation is a program (DMP) which parallel to embryonic maturation during early neural tube development, and, alcohol exposure delayed this DMP along with retarded embryonic growth. To further understanding the methyl binding protein which connection between DNA methylation and gene expression in DMP, we studied the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 (MBD1). To mimic similar patterns of brain damage known to occur when pregnant women drink alcohol in chronic and in binge drinking pattern, we employed Liquid Diet [LD; 4% v/v alcohol on gestational (E) days 7 to E17; BAC 100-200mg/dL, analyzed at E17] and Vapor Chamber (VC, 6hrs of 300mg/dL beginning at E8 and harvest at E10) model of alcohol administration. Alcohol in LD paradigm, reduced the brain weights on E17, and markedly delayed the hippocampus development and a significant reduction in cortex thickness. In the VC model, alcohol caused embryonic growth retardation as indicated by Van Farber scoring system. Through immunostaining, we found that the MeCP2 and MBD1 exhibited reversed expression patterns. As compared to controls, a marked increase of immunointensity and number of MeCP2+ cells, while a significant decrease in immunointensity and number of MBD1+ cells were found in the developing hippocampal and migratory cortical areas. A similar finding was observed in VC binge model showing the marked increase of MeCP2 and decrease of MBD1 in the fore- and hindbrain regions of telencephalic wall, optic and otic vesicles, and first branchial arch in the alcohol treated E10 embryos. Through both chronic and binge models, we showed for the first time that alcohol-induced a contrast change of MeCP2 and MBD1 which correlated with neural developmental delay. This finding strongly supports our previous observation on alcohol disrupted DMP. Furthermore, since MeCP2 and MBD1 are functioning in mediate the DNA methylation to gene repression, the consequence of their alteration further signifies the altered DMP hypothesis on alcohol induced neurodevelopment deficit.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defect and neurobehavioral disorders in humans. In the most severe cases, these abnormalities make up a pattern of malformations termed fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). This syndrome is associated with high prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and hearing disorders in neonates and children. Thus, alcohol exposure in utero is a potential factor for the etiology and mechanisms of enhanced seizure susceptibility in neonates with FAS. Evidence indicates that rodent subjected to gestational alcohol exposure exhibit altered auditory brainstem responses, which lasted into adulthood. The inferior colliculus (IC), the generator of auditory brainstem responses wave V, plays a critical role in the initiation of tonic-clonic seizures following alcohol withdrawal. Thus, alcohol-induced changes in IC neuronal excitability may contribute to the mechanisms of enhanced seizure susceptibility associated with FAS. Here, we examined the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on firing and voltageactivated Ca2+ channel (Cav) currents in dissociated IC neurons obtained from neonatal rat offspring (P3-P7). Pregnant rats received a single dose of 5 g/kg body weight ethanol (95%) as a 30% (v/v) solution in Isomil by gastric intubation at gestational day 18. Control animals received only Isomil. IC neurons were recorded in whole cell patch clamp configuration for current- and voltage-clamp experiments. Cav currents were measured using 5 mM Ca2+. Quantification shows that prenatal alcohol exposure elicits the occurrence of >2 action potentials (APs) evoked by depolarizing current injections. Such elevated responses were not seen in control IC neurons which only exhibited a single AP. Increasing extracellular (from 2 mM to 5 mM) Ca2+ concentration reversibly enhanced the number of APs in control IC neurons. Quantification also shows that Cav current density was significantly elevated in IC neurons following prenatal alcohol exposure. Pharmacological analysis reveals that Cav1.2/ Cav1.3 and Cav2.3 contribute to the enhanced current density in neonatal IC neurons following prenatal alcohol exposure. These findings suggested that altered Cav1.2/Cav1.3 and Cav2.3 signaling may play important roles in the pathophysiology of FAS-associated diseases of neuronal excitability.

N2  - Adult offspring of female mice that consume moderate levels of alcohol throughout gestation display deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (Brady et al. 2011). In the present studies, we assessed the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the levels and subcellular distribution of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits and on NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the adult (2-5 months of age) mouse dentate gyrus. Using a limited access, PAE drinking paradigm (Brady, et al. 2011), dams were offered 10% (w/v) ethanol sweetened with 0.066% (w/v) saccharin for 4 hours a day during pregnancy, reaching BACs of 90.5 +/-11.61 mg/dL (n=11); controls consumed 0.066% (w/v) saccharin (SAC). NMDAR subunit levels present in characterized synaptic and extrasynaptic (non-synaptic) subcellular fractions were measured by semi-quantitative immunoblotting. We found that, compared to SAC control mice, in PAE mice, the levels of GluN1 and GluN3A were increased (GluN1 - SAC 1.00 +/- 0.03, PAE 1.87 +/- 0.19, p <0.05, n=5; GluN3A - SAC 1.00 +/- 0.07, PAE 1.54 +/- 0.19, p<0.05, n=8) in the synaptic fraction, while levels of GluN2B were decreased (SAC 1.00 +/- 0.12, PAE 0.65 +/- 0.06, p<0.05, n=7), with no changes in subunit levels in the non-synaptic fraction. We also prepared coronal brain slices and used field recordings to determine whether the observed deficit in synaptic GluN2B-containing receptors resulted in changes in synaptic transmission. Although we found no difference in NMDARdependent I/O curves, we did find that ifenprodil, a GluN2B subunit specific antagonist, blocked a reduced percentage of the NMDAR-dependent field potential in PAE animals compared to controls (SAC 11.19 +/- 2.51%, PAE 3.01 +/- 2.47%, p<0.05, n=7), indicating that fewer functional GluN2B subunits were present in PAE animals. Furthermore, using an LTP protocol that was both NMDAR-dependent and GluN2B-dependent, we found that LTP in the dentate gyrus was impaired in PAE animals [at 45 min SAC - 178.6 +/- 35.61%, PAE 108.9 +/- 25.71%; repeated measure ANOVA found a significant effect of time (F[36, 432] = 4.655, p=0.0001), treatment (F[1, 12] = 5.365, p<0.05), and an interaction (F[36, 432] = 2.754, p=0.0001)]. These data indicate the alterations in NMDAR subunit levels, particularly a decrease in GluN2B levels in the synaptic fraction, in PAE animals result in LTP deficits, and may underlie, at least partially, the learning and memory deficits observed in these animals.

N2  - The Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM) provides researchers and clinicians with a heuristic for understanding a process of intentional behavior change. The model's constructs can provide indicators of an individual's progression from problem recognition and contemplation, through preparation and commitment, to observable changes in a target behavior. The TTM constructs predict outcomes (Carbonari & DiClemente, 2000) and explain the mechanisms through which interventions work to facilitate behavior change (Pinto, Marcus, DePue, Goldstein, 2001; Stotts, DeLaune, Schmitz, & Grabowski 2004). TTM profiles can provide clinicians a guide to target interventions to an individual's status of change as indicated by his/her level of motivational readiness to change, decisional considerations, selfefficacy and temptation, and the use of the experiential and behavioral processes of change (Velasquez, Maurer-Gaddy, Crouch, & DiClemente, 2001). The current study used data from Project CHOICES Efficacy Trial, a multisite study to test an intervention for the prevention of alcohol-exposed pregnancy. A Profile Analysis was conducted to compare TTM construct profiles of women at the 3month post-treatment assessment who reduced their drinking to below risk levels (less than 5 drinks a day and less than 8 drinks per week) and women who continued to drink at risk levels at 9 months post treatment. The TTM construct profiles in the current study consisted of the women's reported use of the experiential and behavioral processes, pros and cons for changing the drinking behavior to below risk levels, and the situational confidence and temptation associated with changing their drinking. There was a significant parallelism effect (p<.001) and levels effect (p=.024). Each of the TTM constructs in the post-treatment profile was significantly different for the women who successfully reduced their drinking at 9 months versus those who did not. Women who successfully reduced their alcohol use had greater reported use of the experiential (p<.001) and behavioral processes (p<.001), greater pros (p<.001) and lower cons (p=.012) for changing drinking, greater confidence (p=.030) and lower temptation (p<.001) than women who continued to drink at risk levels at 9 months. Clinicians can use TTM construct profiles to provide targeted interventions to improve the probability of an individual achieving successful change in alcohol behavior.

N2  - The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code is a rigorous FASD diagnostic protocol based on measurements of growth, face, brain damage, and prenatal alcohol exposure (Astley, 2004). To date only one study in Washington is known to describe the characteristics of persons screened for FASD based on the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code criteria (Astley, 2010). This paper provides comparative data to begin to explore the validity and discuss the consistency of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code criteria by examining 863 cases from Minnesota. Five Minnesota clinics were involved in the data collection efforts related to the FASD screening. Two clinics were in Minneapolis, two in northern Minnesota and one was in the southeast region of the state. The data are based on chart reviews of patients who were screened for FASD in 2001 to 2003. Prior to this study two of the five clinics were involved in the diagnosis of FASD. The other three clinics received training from staff at the University of Minnesota and the University of Washington. The sample included 863 persons who had been referred to one of five Minnesota FASD diagnostic clinics. Most of the 863 cases (795; 92.4%) were 18 years or younger and confirmed to be born in the United States (662; 76.7%). The cases were predominately white (44.0%) and non- Hispanic (98.5%). Of those cases where the mothers' age at birth was known (55.4%), almost half of the participants were born to mothers who were 25 years or younger at the time of the birth. 164 (19.0%) of the cases were diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome [FAS/PFAS], 295 (34.3%) with static encephalopathy [SE], and 174 (20.2%) with neurodevelopmental disorder [ND]. Of the remaining cases, 30 (3.5%) did not receive a FASD related diagnosis and 197 (22.8%) did not fall within the four digit code diagnostic area; and 135 had the unknown history of alcohol exposure [AE]. Examination of comorbidity by diagnostic status revealed significant differences in the distribution of ADHD, conduct disorder/ODD, learning disorders, mental retardation, and anxiety disorder by FASD diagnosis. In general FAS/PFAS and Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed diagnoses had the greater prevalence of these four additional diagnoses. This report documents the characteristics of person screened for FASD using the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. Future comparative studies across states (e.g., Minnesota and Washington) should be pursued to further validate the diagnostic tool.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) persists as a major public health concern. Confidence in diagnosis for "non-FAS" FASD is limited by the absence of facial features and by variable neurobehavioral effects. Our goal is to identify an "epigenetic" profile as a pattern of DNA methylation in infant blood that is a valid biomarker of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a sensitive predictor of neurobehavioral outcomes that together may aid in early detection and diagnosis of FASD. Methods. Subjects from a large prospective pregnant African American cohort with assessments of maternal alcohol use beginning at the first antenatal visit were selected based on our validated metric of prenatal "at-risk alcohol exposure" (Chiodo et al., 2009) and available subsequent neurobehavioral assessment. With maternal consent, infant heel-stick "blood spots" were obtained from the Michigan Neonatal BioBank archive for 5 at-risk PAE infants and 7 non-exposed infant controls. DNA was extracted, subjected to bisulfite conversion, hybridized to an Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, fluorescent stained, scanned, and whole-genome CpG methylation status for >27,000 sites determined. Differentially methylated sites were filtered with a cut-point at p<0.01. Results. At-risk PAE was associated with a set of significantly hypermethylated DNA sites in dried infant blood. Among the 50 most differentially methylated sites, all 5 PAE infants had 9 to 15 to hypermethylated sites whereas 5 of 7 non-exposed infants had zero. The other two non-exposed controls had only 2 or 3 (chi2=12.0, p=.007). No sites were significantly hypomethylated after PAE. The degrees of DNA hypermethylation in many of these same sites were correlated significantly with memory, behavior and fine motor problems (but few with birth weight or IQ) in these children at 4 years of age. DNA hypermethylation was also related to other measures of risk drinking (e.g., average amount of alcohol drunk per drinking day across pregnancy & the TACER-3 screen). Conclusions. Differential patterns of DNA methylation (or "epigenetic marks") in blood may effectively detect infants exposed to at-risk maternal drinking and predict life-long FASD. Other predictors, factors, genes or outcomes, as well as potential 'mechanisms of pathology' that may be indicated by which genes are altered, all remain to be determined in future analyses.

N2  - Identification of the newborn infants exposed to alcohol in utero is essential to establishing early intervention strategies. Previous studies have shown that fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), non-oxidative metabolites of alcohol, in meconium are potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure in term newborns. However, the identification of specific FAEEs and threshold concentrations of FAEEs which correlate with exposure remains under investigation. The aim of this study was to evaluate FAEEs in the meconium of infants and identify a concentration and pattern of FAEEs to serve as accurate biomarkers of in utero ETOH exposure. Pregnant women were recruited from the University of New Mexico substance abuse clinic during one of the first prenatal care visits and categorized into: a) alcohol-exposed (>1 binge episode or >3 drinks/wk on average since the last menstrual period [LMP]); and b) controls (alcohol abstainers since LMP). FAEEs were measured in the meconium of 38 infants born to cohort participants (12 exposed and 26 controls). Meconium was extracted and analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The data (ng of FAEEs/g of meconium) was not normally distributed and was therefore log-transformed and analyzed via the Mann-Whitney U test. Cut off analysis was performed using Chi-Square. FAEEs were detectable in all meconium samples. Concentrations of Stearic FAEE were elevated in alcohol-exposed infants compared to non-exposed infants (p=0.058). The set threshold of significance for the amount of FAEEs (specifically Linoleic and Linolenic) was set as greater than 10,000 ng/g of meconium. The observed difference in quantity of Linoleic and Linolenic FAEEs (ng/g of meconium sample) in control vs exposed infants could potentially trend towards significance with a larger sample number [11.5% of control infants vs. 41.6% of alcohol-exposed infants (p=0.08)]. Based on these results, infants exposed to alcohol in utero (based on maternal report) trended towards higher concentrations of Stearic in their meconium compared to control infants and they had four-fold elevated levels of Linoleic+ Linolenic ethyl esters compared to non-exposed newborns. While other investigators have shown that one FAEE (i.e. Linoleic ethyl ester) is found in higher concentrations in alcohol-exposed newborns, we have shown that a combination of FAEEs at certain threshold values holds further promise for more accurate identification of the alcohol-exposed newborns.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability. The mechanisms underlying FASD are incompletely understood, and biomarkers to identify those at risk are lacking. Here, we detail the metabolomic analysis of embryoid bodies and neural lineages derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cell, and we identify the neural secretome produced in response to ethanol exposure. Methods: WA01 and WA09 hES cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies, neural progenitors or neurons. Cells along this progression were cultured for four days with 0%, 0.1% or 0.3% ethanol. Supernatants from the last 24hr of culture were subjected to C18 chromatography followed by ESI-QTOF-MS. Features were annotated using public databases and the identities of four putative biomarkers were confirmed with purified standards and comparative MS/MS. Results: Ethanol treatment induced statistically significant changes to metabolite abundance in human embryoid bodies (180 features), neural progenitors (76 features) and neurons (42 features). There were no shared significant features between different cell types. Fifteen features showed a dose-response to ethanol. Four chemical identities were confirmed; Lthyroxine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, and the tryptophan metabolites L-kynurenine, and indoleacetaldehyde. One feature with a putative annotation of succinyladenosine was significantly increased in both ethanol treatments. Additional features were selective to ethanol treatment but were not annotated in public databases. Conclusions: Ethanol exposure induces statistically significant changes to the metabolome profile of human embryoid bodies, neural progenitors and neurons. Several of these metabolites are normally present in human serum, suggesting their usefulness as potential serum FASD biomarkers. These findings suggest the biochemical pathways that are affected by ethanol in the developing nervous system and delineate mechanisms of alcohol injury during human development.

N2  - Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) have been described as one biomarker of in utero alcohol exposure in term newborns. Because alcohol use significantly increases the risk of premature delivery, we continue to evaluate the identification and the consequences of in utero alcohol exposure on the premature newborn. We hypothesized that elevations of placental FAEEs would assist in the identification of the alcohol-exposed premature newborn. After informed consent, alcohol use during pregnancy was determined in mothers who had delivered a premature newborn <1500 grams via an extensive maternal questionnaire. Alcohol exposure was defined as maternal admittance to drinking alcohol during the pregnancy. Placental tissues from alcohol-exposed (n=12) and non-exposed (n=39) pregnancies were evaluated for FAEEs via Gas Chromatography/Mass spectroscopy. Data were not normally disturbed and were natural log transformed for analyses via SPSS. Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy significantly increased total placental FAEEs compared to non-exposed pregnancies (p=0.041). Furthermore, the combination of Oleic + Linoleic + Linolenic and Arachidonic Acids (OLL + AA) was significantly elevated in alcohol-exposed placentas compared to non-exposed (p=0.029). These results suggest that placental tissue FAEEs are elevated with alcohol exposure in the premature newborn. Inclusion of the placenta in investigations for the development of biomarkers including FAEEs may assist in accurately identifying the alcohol-exposed newborn.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol abuse causes important structural and functional brain defects and is the leading cause of preventable retardation in the United States. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a broad term used to describe individuals exposed prenatally to alcohol and encompasses a broad range of birth defects including facial abnormalities and learning, motor, and behavioral deficits. Despite promoting alcohol abstinence during pregnancy, the incidence of FASD has failed to decline and individuals lacking cardinal facial abnormalities and historical exposure are increasingly difficult to identify. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is readily available, provides superior brain contrast, and in previous human studies of FASD has shown significant volume reductions in various brain structures. We hypothesize that postnatal MRI derived volumetric brain measurements can predict prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant ewes received 2.5 g/kg alcohol (N = 5) IV three consecutive days per week from gestation day 4-41 (mimicking a binge drinking pattern in the first trimester of pregnancy) while remaining ewes were controls (N = 5). Lambs were sacrificed at 5 months of age, their brains were perfused with fixative, and MRI's were performed immediately post mortem.T1-weighted images were used to calculate cerebellar volume (Inveon Research Workplace software, Siemens). Mean cerebellar volume in controls (10,655.02 +/- 943.51mm3) did not significantly differ from the alcohol group (10,519.18 +/- 181.87 mm3) (p = .891). These MRI findings are consistent with a our previous work utilizing stereological methods on the fetal cerebellum and the same first trimester alcohol exposure. The total estimated cerebellar Purkinje cell number and Purkinje cell density decreased significantly in the alcohol group compared to the control group but no significant differences existed between cerebellar volumes. Cerebellar volume is therefore a poor predictor of first trimester alcohol exposure at this alcohol dose and pattern in sheep, but MRI derived volumetric measures of other brain structures may be beneficial and further studies are warranted.

All or part of this work was done in conjunction with the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), which is funded by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA).

N2  - We have reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy alters placental expression of genes associated with nervous and vascular system development. Gonzalez and colleagues have shown that daily injections of 3 g/kg ethanol in mouse dams (maternal serum ethanol concentration of ~200 mg/dL) causes striking distortions in the density and radial orientation of the cerebral cortical microvascular network in PD2-old offspring. The present study addressed two questions: 1) Does moderate maternal drinking during pregnancy alter the expression of fetal cortical genes associated with neural and vascular development in a manner similar to the changes previously observed in placenta, and 2) does more moderate ethanol exposure affect fetal cortical microvascular development? Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0% or 5% ethanol solution in 0.066% saccharin water for four hours each day throughout gestation. The mean daily ethanol consumption of 2.72 g/kg, which produces a peak maternal SEC of 84 mg/dL, did not affect maternal weight gain, litter size or birth weight. On GD20, rat placental:fetal units were removed by Caesarian section and both placenta and cerebral cortex were processed for mRNA expression array analysis. In addition, fetal frontal cortices were evaluated for vascular density in the cortical plate (CP), intermediate zone (IZ), and ventricular zone (VZ) layers. Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) significantly altered the expression of 686 genes in fetal cortex and 529 genes in placenta. Gene ontology analyses revealed a significant enrichment in genes associated with neural and vascular development in both tissue types from ethanol-exposed offspring. Ethanol exposure decreased vascular density in all three layers of cerebral cortex. The reduction was statistically significant in the ventricular zone. No changes in the radial orientation of the microvascular were observed. These results indicate that moderate levels of fetal ethanol exposure affect both the expression of genes associated with vascular development as well as the microvasculature in the developing cortex. Our data suggest that further investigation of the connection between cerebral microvascular development and neural development is warranted to uncover mechanisms of fetal alcohol-induced damage.

N2  - Introduction. Most children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy cannot be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We are investigating whether alterations in placental gene and protein expression at term may provide a reliable and sensitive diagnostic indicator of fetal alcohol exposure as well as a prognostic indicator of risk for functional brain damage leading to adverse neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes in affected offspring. We previously reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy differentially affects placental genes, including those coding for proteins associated with nervous, vascular and immune system development. In the current study, we used a combination of proteomic analyses and western blotting to confirm the identification of proteins altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy. Methods. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were assigned to one of two experimental groups. One group consumed a 5% ethanol solution (in 0.066% saccharin water) four hours each day throughout gestation, resulting in a mean maternal peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. A control group consumed a matched volume of saccharin water. At term (Gestational Day 20) placentas were harvested, saline-perfused to remove blood from the tissue, and processed for analysis of protein expression. Results. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis of placental tissue detected 1181 protein spots, twenty of which were significantly altered by maternal drinking during pregnancy. Fourteen of the altered protein spots have been identified via mass spectroscopic analysis. Some of the identified proteins play critical roles in placental and neural development, angiogenesis or apoptosis. Recently, western blotting has confirmed the ethanol-induced alterations for two of the identified proteins, namely, Annexin IV and Cerebral Cavernous Malformation Protein 3. Conclusions. These results indicate that placental proteins associated with vascular remodeling are altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy and could serve as biomarker candidates for fetal ethanol exposure and fetal ethanol effects. Further, these results provide insights on novel mechanisms of how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function.

N2  - Introduction: Craniofacial bone dysmorphology is an important but under explored diagnostic feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study aims to examine effects of dose and timing of fetal alcohol exposure on a set of craniofacial bones in a mouse model, while co-varying for the head size variation. Methods: C57BL/6J dams were randomly assigned into three different alcohol treatment groups representing two doses (high vs. low) and two timings (long vs. short) at postpregnancy: a 10-day exposure from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E16 on either 4.2% v/v (high dose long exposure, HDLE) or 3.6% v/v (low dose long exposure, LDLE) respectively, and a 5-day exposure during E7-E11 with 4.2% v/v (high dose short exposure, HDSE). A CHOW group, fed with ad libitum mouse chow and water throughout the experiment, served as the controls. The Micro-CT scan yielded volumetric data for each mouse sample with 40x40x40 um3 voxel spacing. Pups born to all treated dams were scanned at postnatal 7 day (P7) and at P21 for longitudinal studies of craniofacial bone development. Using the Amira software,17 landmarks on the craniofacial bone surfaces were defined to estimate a head size, and the frontal, parietal, occipital and mandible bones were segmented. The volumes of the four bones were analyzed using general linear model with SPSS 19 to examine effect of alcohol disposure on craniofacial bone development while controlling for the head size. Multiple comparison was corrected by the Sidak method. Results: At P7, HDSE showed less volume in all four bones than any other group (p<0.001). At P21, compared with CHOW, HDSE showed reduced volume in all four bones (p<0.027), HDLE in parietal bone only (p=0.006), and LDLE in frontal, parietal and occipital bones (p<0.03). LDLE showed less frontal bone development than HDLE (p=0.048), and HDSE showed less mandible development than HDLE (p=0.005). Conclusion: These results demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure had a dose-and timing-dependent impact on reducing craniofacial bone development after birth. And, the short exposure had an early and sustained effect on all the bones throughout the tested age range, while the long exposure affected only selected bones at a later stage. Further studies on general craniofacial measures will help delineate effects of quantity and frequency of fetal alcohol exposure to enable diagnosis of FASD.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is diagnosed using criteria of growth retardation, nervous system damage, and a distinct pattern of facial dysmorphology. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) show a wide spectrum of pathognomonic facial features that are thought to be attributed to differences in alcohol dose, or the developmental period of exposure. This study explored alcohol induced facial abnormalities attributed to varied alcohol dose and or distinct developmental periods, Using a mouse model of liquid diet alcohol exposure we examined alcohol doses of 4.0% v/v and 3.1% v/v with exposure stages from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E11 and E7-E16. Female C56BL/6J mice were divided into three groups. Chow groups were given ad libitum chow and water throughout the experimental period. The alcohol groups (Alc) were given a liquid diet of either 3.1%v/v or 4.0%v/v alcohol for 1 week prior to mating. During pregnancy the Alc groups were alcohol diet on embryonic days 7 (E7)-E11 or E7-E16. The Pair-fed (PF) dams were given equal volumes of an isocaloric diet parrelled to Alc groups. All embryos were analyzed at E17 using 15 facial measurements (derived analogs of human anthropometry), along with measures of crown-rump, weight, and head circumference. Statistical analysis was performed using both 2 and 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, testing individual treatment effects within groups and effect of stage, dose, and txt (alc vs pf). At 4.8% alcohol dose exposure stages demonstrated altered whisker pad, all facial depth measurements, and lower facial height at E7-E16 with only upper facial depth, and minimal frontal height differences within E7-E11. At 3.1% dose, differences were minimal between with dysmorpholgy of columella and philtrum at longer exposure not seen at E7-E11. Variations effected by alcohol dose were pronounced with width, height and depth measurements at 4.0% not seen at 3.1%. There were distinct difference in columella and philtrum at 3.6% not seen at the 4.0% dose comparing longer stage exposure. The dose and duration of alcohol exposure are important factors contributing to the severity of facial dysmophology and growth retardation. High dose alcohol demonstrated more dysmorphic features then lower dose, with distinct morphological changes between doses. The shorter stage (E7-E11) exposure showed less dysmorphology in both alcohol doses.

N2  - Varying brain retardation is one of the most critical features of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). MRI studies have shown regional patterns of dysmorphology including microcephaly, and altered cortical thickness, corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis structures. However, how do alcohol dose and timing affect variable brain dysfunction is not clear. Our recent studies have shown the dose- and exposure-length dependent alcohol effects on the craniofacial as well as skull bone volume developments. This study investigated how comparable the brain and craniofacial developments were impacted under the alcohol influence in the same set of mice. C57BL/6J dams were randomly assigned into three alcohol exposure (ALC) groups subjecting to 4.2% v/v (E7 - E11 or E7 - E16) or 3.6% v/v (E7 - E16) respectively. The pair-fed (PF) and CHOW groups were included to serve as non-alcohol and overall controls. On postnatal days (P) 21, mouse heads were imaged using a 9.4T preclinical MRI system with 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequence to acquire volumetric images with voxel size as low as 40 microns. Regions of interests including the whole brain, olfactory bulbs, cortex, and cerebellum were segmented and the volumes were calculated. Data was examined by ANOVA followed with paired comparison between treatment groups to test the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure.Calculating from amount of food intake, we found liquid diet group consume similar level of calories but less amount of micronutrient (<50% across the elements, e.g. iron, zinc, vitamin B1). The 4.2% ALC treated group (E7 - E16) showed consistently smaller mean volumes for brain regions measured than the other two groups, indicating that prenatal alcohol exposure hampered fetal brain development. Comparing PF with CHOW pups, only cerebellum volume was observed to be significantly different. These results suggest that alcohol and nutrition both could contribute to brain volume reduction. Alcohol under restricted micronutrient has broader impact in more brain regions. Furthermore, the effect of alcohol on brain volume reduction is dose dependent. These results are comparable with craniofacial and skull bone volume analyses performed on the same subjects. These results demonstrated that alcohol exposure led to comparable effect on brain volume reduction and degree of facial dysmorphology, and demonstrated an important information how facial dysmorphology might be a mirror of the brain in FASD.

N2  - It is critical that we better understand why there is substantial phenotypic variability following prenatal alcohol exposure. It is likely that genetic and environmental risk factors affect the degree to which prenatal alcohol exposure results in the characteristic features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Genetic screens using the zebrafish model have been particularly useful in advancing our understanding of vertebrate development. Depending upon the mutated gene, zebrafish exposed to alcohol during early embryonic development have variable craniofacial defects of the jaw, palate and skull base. Using this model, several genes within the Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathways appear to have gene x alcohol exposure interactions - suggesting that these genes may play a role in the variable effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. To further explore these genes, we utilized genotypic data from a genomewide SNP array in a sample of 240 individuals with variable alcohol exposure. All individuals completed a uniform neurobehavioral evaluation and most also had a 3D facial image. Brain (MRI) imaging was available for 70 subjects. Initial analyses were performed to evaluate 11 candidate genes in the PDGF, FGF, and BMP pathways. Analyses were limited to the Caucasian subset (n=94) due to racial differences in facial measurements. Based on the results of analyses in the zebrafish, 5 anthropometric measurements, corrected for age and gender, were initially analyzed: inner canthal width, outer canthal width, lower facial height, lower facial depth, and midfacial depth. The analytic model included the main effects of SNP genotype and prenatal alcohol exposure (Yes or No) as well as the interaction of SNP with prenatal alcohol exposure (the key variable of interest).Promising evidence of association was found with 6 SNPs in PDGFRB (genotype x exposure p < 3 x 10-3) with the phenotypes of mid and lower facial depths. One SNP in PDGFRA provided evidence of association with several anthropometric measures (p <1.7 x 10-3). Ongoing analyses are examining these candidate genes for their association with specific neurobehavioral and brain imaging phenotypes.

N2  - Intrauterine alcohol exposure is one of many factors known to predispose offspring to adult disease by deregulating developmental and/or metabolic pathways heavily interconnected to one another. Alcohol exposure in utero has been shown to perturb vitamin A metabolism in the developing tissues, although the exact mechanisms of this interference have not been clarified yet. Vitamin A is an essential nutrient that regulates many crucial biological functions during adult life and embryogenesis. Both excess and deficiency of vitamin A in the developing tissues lead to congenital defects or lethality. In addition, many adult pathological conditions have been associated with alterations of the metabolism of this nutrient. Therefore, to better understand the mechanisms whereby prenatal alcohol exposure compromises health later in life, this study investigates the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on adult retinoid metabolism. Plasma, liver, lung and prostate tissues were collected from 60-75 days-old males and females Sprague Dawley rats born from dams: 1) fed with liquid diet containing 6.7% alcohol between GD 7 and 21 (AF); 2) pair-fed with isocaloric liquid diet during the same gestational window (PF); or 3) fed ad libitum with rat chow throughout pregnancy (AD). Plasma and tissues retinol and retinyl ester levels were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. Lung retinyl ester levels were significantly reduced in both males and females from AF dams compared to those from PF mothers. Additionally, hepatic retinyl ester levels were reduced and serum retinol levels were increased only in males from AF dams compared those born from PF mothers. Finally, ventral prostate retinyl ester levels were significantly reduced in males from AF dams compared those from PF mothers. This study is the first to report that prenatal alcohol exposure in rats affects retinoid metabolism in adult life, in a tissue and sex dependent manner. Giving the crucial role of vitamin A in maintaining the health of the body throughout life, these data warrant further studies to investigate the molecular mechanism through which alcohol exposure during embryonic development compromises vitamin A metabolism of adult organs such as liver, lung and prostate, likely predisposing to detrimental consequnces on health.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a severe manifestation of embryonic exposure to ethanol. It presents with characteristic defects to the face and organs, including mental retardation due to disordered and damaged brain development. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a term used to cover a continuum of birth defects that occur due to maternal alcohol consumption, and occurs in approximately 4% of children born in the United States. With 50% of child-bearing age women reporting consumption of alcohol, and half of all pregnancies being unplanned, unintentional exposure is a continuing issue. In order to best understand the damage produced by ethanol, plus produce a model with which to test potential interventions, we developed a model of developmental ethanol exposure using the zebrafish embryo. Zebrafish are ideal for this kind of teratogen study. Each pair lays hundreds of eggs, which can then be collected without harming the adult fish. The zebrafish embryo is transparent and can be readily imaged with any number of stains. Analysis of these embryos after exposure to ethanol at different doses and times of duration and application shows that the gross developmental defects produced by ethanol are consistent with the human birth defect. Described here are the basic techniques used to study and manipulate the zebrafish FAS model.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with various adverse effects on human brain and behavior. Recently, neuroimaging studies have begun to identify PAE effects on specific brain structures. Investigation of such specific PAE effects is important for understanding the teratogenic mechanism of PAE on human brain, which is critical for differentiating PAE from other disorders. In this structural MRI study with young adults, PAE effects on the volumes of automatically segmented cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs) were evaluated both through a group difference approach and a parametric approach. In the group difference approach (comparing among two PAE and a control groups), a disproportionate PAE effect was found in several occipital and temporal regions. This result is inconsistent with previous studies with child samples. Moreover, a gender difference in PAE effect was shown in some cortical ROIs. These findings suggest that sampling and gender may be important factors for interpreting specific PAE effects on human brain. With the parametric approach, it was demonstrated that the higher the PAE level, the smaller the entire brain, the lower the IQ. Several cortical and subcortical ROIs also exhibited a negative correlation between the PAE level and ROI volume. Furthermore, our data showed that the PAE effect on the brain could not be interpreted by the PAE effect on general physical growth until the young adult age. This study provides valuable insight into specific effects of PAE on human brain and suggests important implications for future studies in this field. ©; 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Ethanol consumption by pregnant women can produce severe effects in the foetus and the newborn, mainly in neurological and weight-height development, and are included in the term FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder). Questionnaires are the most used screening method to detect prenatal exposure, but a previous population study questioned its reliability. The objective of this study was to compare alcohol prenatal exposure detection by questionnaire compared with biomarkers in meconium. Methodology: Sixty two meconium samples from mothers who denied alcohol consumption during pregnancy by questionnaire were analysed. The objective analysis was made by determination of FAEEs (fatty acid ethyl esters) as exposure biomarkers in meconium as biological matrix. Results: In the meconium from 10 of 62 newborns from non-alcohol consuming mothers by questionnaire (16.12%) FAEE values were positive (> 2 nmol/g). Discussion: Questionnaires as a screening method during pregnancy are not a reliable tool. It is necessary to identify prenatal exposure to alcohol as soon as possible by biomarkers analysis in biological matrices from the newborn or the mother. The early detection will allow these patients to benefit from follow up and treatment to reach the best possible neurological development. © 2012 Asociacion Espanolade Pediatria.

N2  - In this study event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on response inhibition identified during task performance. ERPs were recorded during a auditory Go/No Go task in two groups of children with mean age of 12.8 years (11 years to 14.7 years): one diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (FAS/PFAS; n = 12) and a control group of children of same age whose mothers abstained from alcohol or drank minimally during pregnancy (n = 11). The children were instructed to push a button in response to the Go stimulus and not to press the button when the No Go stimulus were heard. Task performance accuracy did not differ between the two groups, however differences were observed in the ERP components: P2, N2, and P3. The P2 amplitude were larger for Go trials in both groups. The FAS/PFAS group showed slower N2 response to Go trials, suggesting a less efficient early classification of the stimulus. P3 showed larger amplitudes to No-Go vs. Go in both groups. The study has provided new evidence for inhibition deficits in FAS/PFAS subjects identified by ERPs.

N2  - Many women continue to consume low to moderate quantities of alcohol during pregnancy, which can result in the variable neurobehavioural effects in the absence of physiological abnormalities that characterize fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Previously, we reported that a mouse model for FASD based on voluntary maternal ethanol consumption throughout gestation resulted in offspring that showed mild developmental delay, anxiety-related traits, and deficits in spatial learning. Here, we extend this model by evaluating the gene expression changes that occur in the adult brain of C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to ethanol via maternal preference drinking. The results of two independent expression array experiments indicate that ethanol induces subtle but consistent changes to global gene expression. Gene enrichment analysis showed over-represented gene ontology classifications of cellular, embryonic, and nervous system development. Molecular network analysis supported these classifications, with significant networks related to cellular and tissue development, free radical scavenging, and small molecule metabolism. Further, a number of genes identified have previously been implicated in FASD-relevant neurobehavioural phenotypes such as cognitive function (Ache, Bcl2, Cul4b, Dkc1, Ebp, Lcat, Nsdh1, Sstr3), anxiety (Bcl2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Nsdh1), and mood disorders (Bcl2, Otx2, Sstr3). The results suggest a complex residual "footprint" of neurodevelopmental ethanol exposure that may provide a new perspective for identifying mechanisms that underlie the life-long persistence of FASD-related cognitive and behavioural alterations, including potential targets for treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - We prospectively identified 96 women consuming at least 4 drinks/day during pregnancy by screening 9628 pregnant women. In these women with heavy prenatal alcohol use, there were three stillbirths and one preterm delivery; 98 matched nondrinking women had no stillbirths and two preterm births. Preterm rates did not differ significantly. The stillbirth rate was higher in the exposed group (p=0.06). Additional investigation showed the stillbirth rate in the exposed population (3.1%) was significantly higher (p=0.019) than the reported Chilean population rate (0.45%). Our data suggest that heavy alcohol consumption may increase the risk for stillbirth but not preterm delivery. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

T1  - Ethanol Affects Differentiation-Related Pathways and Suppresses Wnt Signaling Protein Expression in Human Neural Stem Cells

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure of the fetus to ethanol (EtOH) can be teratogenic. We previously showed that EtOH alters the cell fate of human neural stem cells (NSC). As Wnt signaling plays an important role in fetal brain development, we hypothesized that EtOH suppresses Wnt signaling protein expression in differentiating NSC and thereby contributes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Methods: NSC isolated from fetal human brains were cultured in mitogenic media to induce neurospheres, which were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and used for all experiments. Equal numbers of NSC were cultured on lysine/laminin-coated plates for 96hours in differentiating media containing 0, 20, or 100mM EtOH. Total mRNA was isolated from samples containing 0 or 100mM EtOH and changes in expression of 263 genes associated with neurogenesis and NSC differentiation were determined by Oligo GEArray technology. The biological impact of gene changes was estimated using a systems biology approach with pathway express software and KEGG database. Based on the pathways identified, expression of Wnt proteins (Wnt3a and Wnt5a), Wnt-receptor complex proteins (p-LRP6, LRP6, DVL2, and DVL3), Wnt antagonist Naked-2 (NKD-2), and downstream Wnt proteins (beta-catenin, Tyr-p-GSK3beta, Ser-p-GSK3beta) were analyzed by Western blot. Results: Of the 263 genes examined, the expressions of 22 genes in differentiating NSC were either upwardly or downwardly affected by EtOH. These genes are associated with 5 pathways/cellular processes: axon guidance; hedgehog signaling; TGF-beta signaling; cell adhesion molecules; and Wnt signaling. When compared to controls, EtOH, at both 20 and 100mM concentrations, suppressed the expression of Wnt3a and Wnt5a, receptor complex proteins p-LRP6, LRP6 and DVL2, and cytoplasmic proteins Ser-p-GSK3beta and beta-catenin. Expression of NKD-2 and DVL3 remained unchanged and the expression of active Tyr-p-GSK3beta increased significantly. Conclusions: EtOH can significantly alter neural differentiation pathway-related gene expression and suppress Wnt signaling proteins in differentiating human NSC. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Structural abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC), such as reduced size and increased shape variability, have been documented in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the regional specificity of altered CC structure, which may point to the timing of neurodevelopmental disturbances and/or relate to specific functional impairments, remains unclear. Furthermore, associations between facial dysmorphology and callosal structure remain undetermined. Methods: One hundred and fifty-three participants (age range 8 to 16) including 82 subjects with FASD and 71 nonexposed controls were included in this study. The structural magnetic resonance imaging data of these subjects was collected at 3 sites (Los Angeles and San Diego, California, and Cape Town, South Africa) and analyzed using classical parcellation schemes, as well as more refined surface-based geometrical modeling methods, to identify callosal morphological alterations in FASD at high spatial resolution. Results: Reductions in callosal thickness and area, specifically in the anterior third and the splenium, were observed in FASD compared with nonexposed controls. In addition, reduced CC thickness and area significantly correlated with reduced palpebral fissure length. Conclusions: Consistent with previous reports, findings suggest an adverse effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on callosal growth and further indicate that fiber pathways connecting frontal and parieto-occipital regions in each hemisphere may be particularly affected. Significant associations between callosal and facial dysmorphology provide evidence for a concurrent insult to midline facial and brain structural development in FASD. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Accumulating evidence from structural brain imaging studies on individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has supported links between prenatal alcohol exposure and brain morphological deficits. Although global and regional volumetric reductions appear relatively robust, the effects of alcohol exposure on cortical thickness and relationships with facial dysmorphology are not yet known. The structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 69 children and adolescents with FASD and 58 nonexposed controls collected from 3 sites were examined using FreeSurfer to detect cortical thickness changes across the entire brain in FASD and their associations with facial dysmorphology. Controlling for brain size, subjects with FASD showed significantly thicker cortices than controls in several frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Analyses conducted within site further revealed prominent group differences in left inferior frontal cortex within all 3 sites. In addition, increased inferior frontal thickness was significantly correlated with reduced palpebral fissure length. Consistent with previous reports, findings of this study are supportive of regional increases in cortical thickness serving as a biomarker for disrupted brain development in FASD. Furthermore, the significant associations between thickness and dysmorphic measures suggest that the severity of brain anomalies may be reflected by that of the face. © 2011 The Author.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is one potential risk factor for spontaneous abortion (SAb). Prior research suggested that heavy drinking during pregnancy was associated with significantly increased rates of SAb, but results for lower levels of drinking have been inconsistent. We examined the association between different levels and patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption and SAb in a high-risk inner-city sample. We hypothesized that higher levels, binge patterns, and more frequent drinking would be associated with increased rates of SAb. The quantity and frequency of self-reported peri-conceptional and repeated in-pregnancy maternal drinking volumes per beverage type were assessed with semi-structured interviews in a prospective subsample of 302 African-American mothers. Relations between various measures of prenatal alcohol exposure and SAb were assessed using logistic regression. After controlling for various potential confounders, there was a significant positive relation between average absolute alcohol use per day across pregnancy and SAb. Greater frequency of drinking episodes also predicted SAb: an average of even one day of drinking per week across pregnancy was associated with an increase in the incidence of SAb. However, contrary to our hypothesis, neither the amount of alcohol drunk per drinking day nor a measure of binge drinking was significantly related to SAb after controlling for confounders. Differences in when women who drank at risk levels initiated antenatal care may have under-estimated the impact of alcohol on SAb in this low-SES urban African-American sample. Some drinking measures averaged across pregnancy may have under-estimated consumption and overestimated risk of SAb, but other risk drinking measures that avoid this limitation show similar relations to SAb. Identifying fetal risk drinking in pregnant women is critical to increasing the effectiveness of interventions that reduce risk level alcohol consumption and protect from pregnancy loss. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are validated biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure. Meconium FAEE testing can potentially be used as a screen by health-care professionals to identify neonates at-risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, thereby permitting diagnostic follow-up of these children and early intervention in those who develop disabilities. The purpose of this study was to assess whether women would willingly partake in a screening program of this nature. This was determined by launching a pilot screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure in a high-risk obstetric unit previously shown to have a high prevalence of FAEE-positive meconium via anonymous meconium testing. The program involved voluntary testing of meconium for FAEEs and long-term developmental follow-up of positive cases through an existing public health program. The participation rate in the screening program was significantly lower than when testing was conducted anonymously (78% vs. 95%, respectively; p < 0.05), and the positivity rate was 3% in contrast to 30% observed under anonymous conditions (p < 0.001). These low rates suggest that the majority of mothers who consumed alcohol in pregnancy refused to participate. We conclude that despite the potential benefits of such screening programs, maternal unwillingness to consent, likely due to fear, embarrassment, and guilt, may limit the effectiveness of meconium testing for population-based open screening, highlighting the need for public education and social marketing efforts for such programs to be of benefit. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - It has been elucidated that psychiatric disorders are associated with impairment of the brain neural network. Reduction in brain size and hypoplasia of the basal ganglia and corpus callosum have been reported in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). It is believed that the formation of the neural network is influenced by alcohol exposure during the fetal period. Additionally, it is well known that the functional expression of CNS consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure includes cognitive and attentional processes, as well as social behavioral problems. It has also been reported that abnormal 5-HT neuron development can be reversed by treatment with a 5-HT1A agonist in a prenatal alcohol exposure model. However, these treatments are prophylactic. Without early intervention, the consequences of FASD are permanent. Recently, emerging evidence suggest that many clinical symptoms observed in psychiatric disease are likely related to neural network disruptions including neurogenesis dysfunction. Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has been investigated in areas such as brain injury, stroke and neurodegenerative diseases and may be a way to reverse neurogenesis dysfunction. In the present work, we evaluated the usefulness of intravenous transplantation of NSCs in the FASD model rat focusing on the possibility of regenerative therapy, particularly regarding behavioral abnormalities, for FASD rats. Abnormal behaviors FASD model rats suggest that reduced social activity , and cognitive dysfunction are major symptoms in FASD patients. Intravenous NSC transplantation appeared to partially correct these behavioral abnormalities in FASD model rats. In the Amygdala areas intravenous NSC transplantation appears to have partially regaenerates expression of PSD95 in FASD model rats. The results suggest that intravenous NSC transplantation may be an advanced approach to recover neural network damage and CNS dysfunction in FASD and possibly other psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure results in major neurodevelopmental deficits. Cognitive impairments are generally most severe in children who meet diagnostic criteria for full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), but significant deficits are also observed in non-syndromal heavily-exposed (HE) children. However, the correlates of these effects in terms of disordered network interactions in the brain have never before been investigated. We used psycho-physiological interaction (Friston et al., 1997) to investigate differential effects of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; an important control region) on modulation of fronto-striatal-cerebellar regions during a simple working memory (WM) task (1-back). Methods: Data were collected in FAS/PFAS (n=17), HE (n=13) and Controls (n=17) groups (M: 8.9<age<10.6 yrs). The task alternated between 0-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), 1-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), and rest (20 s) epochs. Time series from the dACC (p<.05, effects of interest) were convolved with the psychological contrast of interest (1-back > 0-back) to investigate modulatory effects. Inter-group differences were evaluated in a second level analysis of variance with group as single factor. Results: See Figure. Conclusions: The increased modulation by the dACC of key brain regions mediating working memory suggests increased cognitive control-related inputs to sub-serve function in FAS/PFAS and HE children. These results constitute the first demonstration of the distal effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the disruption of functional interactions between key brain regions.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which manifests itself in the form of physiological defects, mental retardation and neurobehavioural deficits, the latter of which is rarely diagnosed. Since maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure and risk for FASD. While Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters (FAEEs) are current biomarkers of exposure, the introduction of a second biomarker that can be tested alongside FAEEs promises to greatly increase the sensitivity and specificity of analytical screens. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium, or first stool of life, of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Whether this detected EtG was formed by the maternal liver and crossed the placenta, by the fetal liver after ethanol crossed the placenta, or by the placenta itself remains unknown. Objectives: To determine if, and to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta, and to measure placental formation and degradation of EtG. Methods: Placentae from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario will be taken to the on-site perfusion laboratory. One mug/mL EtG will be added to the maternal reservoir and maternal and fetal samples will be taken over a 3 hour period to determine if and to what degree EtG is crossing the human placenta. EtG will be quantified using HS-SPME GC-MS. Placental metabolism of ethanol to EtG and EtG to ethanol will be investigated using placental microsomes. Kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km) will also be determined to help elucidate the role of the placenta in formation and degradation of EtG. Results: To date the perfusions are being carried out and the level of EtG in the perfusate will be determined using HS-SPME GC-MS with a limit of sensitivity of 1 ng/vial. Conclusions: We have developed a HS-SPME method for detecting EtG in maternal and fetal perfusate samples. This will allow us to accurately quantify the transfer of EtG across the human placenta.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase prevent cellular damage produced by free radicals. Our objective was to evaluate if prenatal alcohol exposure decreased the expression of antioxidant enzymes in the brain, liver, or placenta of fetal mice. STUDY DESIGN: Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with intraperitoneal injection of alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or saline (control). Fetuses were harvested on gestational day 18. Fetal brain, liver, and placenta were analyzed for mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase by real-time polymerase chain reaction, with 18S RNA used as reference. RESULTS: Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase expression was lower in fetal brains exposed to alcohol with no differences detected in the liver or placenta between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Maternal alcohol consumption causes a decrease in superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase expression in the fetal brain. This may explain the long-term neurologic findings in fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Alcoholism during pregnancy is one of the most common factors in western societies causing persisting congenital and multiple physical as well as neurological impairments. Finding the diagnosis at first sight puts medical professionals into a demanding situation. Therefore the objective of this study was to detect patients' developmental characteristics with the main focus on the necessity of the diagnosis itself. Patients: 125 young patients, whose diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made at the Muenster University Hospital, were followed up. Methods: Biographic details such as living conditions, health, developmental problems and educational career were gathered using a structured interview. The diagnosis itself and the impact of this on the patients were also explored. Results: Patients displayed characteristics of a less mature trait of character. The majority were looked after by foster parents. High rates of social and developmental problems could be found. The diagnosis was identified as a protective factor, with significantly better outcomes for patients being diagnosed in early childhood. A diagnosis established later in life was particularly helpful for the families and caregivers. Feelings of failure and self-blame could be diminished. Conclusions: The early detection of affected children has to be improved as receiving the correct diagnosis, despite the persistent impairments, is of major benefit for both patients and their families. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart  New York.

N2  - Background: The physical features of fetal alcohol syndrome include smooth philtrum, thin vermillion border, short palpebral fissures, microcephaly, and growth deficiencies on weight and height. However, little is known about the specific quantities of alcohol exposure, pattern of drinking, timing of exposure, and magnitude of risk for each of these features. Methods: Using data on 992 subjects collected prospectively in California between 1978 and 2005, we examined the patterns and timing of alcohol exposure in relation to these features. Structural features were assessed by a dysmorphologist who performed a blinded physical examination of all infants. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0 to 6weeks postconception, 6 to 12weeks postconception, first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester. Results: Higher prenatal alcohol exposure in every pattern was significantly associated with the incidence of smooth philtrum but not with short palpebral fissures. The strongest associations were with timing of exposure in the second half of the first trimester (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.36 for average number of drinks per day; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.26 for maximum number of drinks in 1 episode). Similarly, thin vermillion border was most strongly associated with exposure in the second half of the first trimester. Findings with respect to timing of exposure were similar for microcephaly and reduced birth weight. However, reduced birth length was increased with exposure in any trimester. These associations were linear, and there was no evidence of a threshold. Conclusions: Reduced birth length and weight, microcephaly, smooth philtrum, and thin vermillion border are associated with specific gestational timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and are dose-related without evidence of a threshold. Women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol consumption from conception throughout pregnancy. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Individuals gestationally exposed to alcohol experience a multitude of sociobehavioral impairments, including deficits in adaptive behaviors such as social skills. Methods: The goal of this report is to critically review research on social skills deficits in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure, including individuals with and without fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Results: Social deficits are found in alcohol-exposed children, adults, and adolescents with and without a clinical presentation. These deficits tend to persist across the lifespan and may even worsen with age. Social deficits in this population appear to be independent of facial dysmorphology and IQ and are worse than can be predicted based on atypical behaviors alone. Abnormalities in neurobiology, executive function, sensory processing, and communication likely interact with contextual influences to produce the range of social deficits observed in FASD. Conclusions: Future investigations should strive to reconcile the relationship between social skills deficits in FASD and variables such as gender, age, cognitive profile, and structural and functional brain impairments to enable better characterization of the deficits observed in this population, which will enhance diagnosis and improve remediation. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Alcoholism is a risk factor for respiratory complications. Alcoholics on mechanical ventilators are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome than non-alcoholics and have an in-hospital mortality rate that is almost double that of non-alcoholics. This indicates alcohol consumption adversely affects respiratory health. However, it is unknown if prenatal alcohol exposure also increases the risk of poor respiratory health in adulthood. Method: Sprague Dawley rats were prenatally exposed to 6% (v/v) ethanol (EtOH) for the entirety of gestation. At 8 months of age they were killed and pulmonary tissue collected for analysis of structural (BAX, Bcl-2, elastin and collagen) and functional (surfactant protein (SP)-A, -B, -C and -D; epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs)-alpha, -beta and -) genes via real-time PCR. Results: Prenatal EtOH-exposure did not alter pulmonary gene expression in female offspring. In contrast, male offspring prenatally exposed to EtOH had significantly lower SP-D mRNA levels (P = 0.041) and higher Col1A1 mRNA levels (P = 0.012) compared to controls. There were no differences in BAX, Bcl-2, elastin, or ENaC subunit mRNA levels between male groups. Conclusions: Chronic, low dose prenatal EtOH exposure in adult males may induce structural changes in the lung and decrease pulmonary host defence. These alterations may increase the risk of pulmonary infections and cause respiratory distress in times of illness. Further analyses need to be performed.

N2  - The associations between light, moderate, and binge prenatal alcohol exposure and child neuropsychological outcomes are unclear. Given recent estimates that in the United States 54% of women of child-bearing age consume alcohol and 49% of pregnancies are unintended, this knowledge has the potential for substantial public health impact. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate evidence for an association between mild, moderate, and binge prenatal alcohol exposure and child neuropsychological outcomes. From 1,312 articles identified through systematic searches in Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO we identified 29 articles that met our inclusion criteria and included cohort data on at least one of seven domains: academic performance, attention, behavior, cognition, language development, memory, and motor skills. We completed sensitivity analyses based on study quality and assessed publication bias. A random effects meta-analysis on data from six studies (N = 8,258) suggests prenatal binge exposure is associated with lower child cognition scores (Cohen's D = 0.18, p < 0.01). These studies showed no evidence of between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) or publication bias (Egger's Test p = 0.33). The association remained after controlling for data quality, but may be due to chance. We did not find any significant associations between mild or moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and child neuropsychological outcomes. Variations in child ages and exposure timing may have masked true associations. Education on alcohol should highlight the potential risks of drinking during pregnancy, particularly binge drinking.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - In part 1, we discussed the mechanism of alcohol exposure, dosimetry, and the teratogenic pathways of damage to the fetus. In part 2, we review the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and the developmental implications of prenatal alcohol exposure. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are associated with increased rates of mental retardation, seizure disorders, brain malformations, and premature mortality. The risk of comorbid disorders is increased among this population, which enhances phenotype severity and complexity of management. Recurrence rates are high and younger siblings tend to be more severely affected. Detection of prenatal alcohol use warrants substance abuse intervention, which can avoid exposure in subsequent pregnancies. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are common developmental disorders with a phenotype that is influenced by both age and development and require long-term management. Child neurologists are essential in the diagnosis and management of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - Individuals with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure can experience significant deficits in cognitive and psychosocial functioning and alterations in brain structure that persist into adulthood. In this report, data from 99 participants collected across three sites (Los Angeles and San Diego, California, and Cape Town, South Africa) were analyzed to examine relationships between brain structure, neurocognitive function, facial morphology, and maternal reports of quantities of alcohol consumption during the first trimester. Across study sites, we found highly significant volume reductions in the FASD group for all of the brain regions evaluated. After correcting for scan location, age, and total brain volume, these differences remained significant in some regions of the basal ganglia and diencephalon. In alcohol-exposed subjects, we found that smaller palpebral fissures were significantly associated with reduced volumes in the ventral diencephalon bilaterally, that greater dysmorphology of the philtrum predicted smaller volumes in basal ganglia and diencephalic structures, and that lower IQ scores were associated with both smaller basal ganglia volumes and greater facial dysmorphology. In subjects from South Africa, we found a significant negative correlation between intracranial volume and total number of drinks per week in the first trimester. These results corroborate previous reports that prenatal alcohol exposure is particularly toxic to basal ganglia and diencephalic structures. We extend previous findings by illustrating relationships between specific measures of facial dysmorphology and the volumes of particular subcortical structures, and for the first time show that continuous measures of maternal alcohol consumption during the first trimester relates to overall brain volume reduction. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Alcohol- induced behavioural problems in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder versus confounding behavioural problems

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is strongly associated with disruptive behaviour in childhood and antisocial behaviour later in life. There are numerous confounding risk factors in the lives of alcohol-abusing mothers that may contribute to the behaviour problems seen in their children, rather than direct brain injury by alcohol. In fact, many of these additional environmental and genetic risk factors for childhood behaviour problems co-occur with prenatal alcohol exposure and affect the same child, creating a confluence of risk. As a result, one cannot with any certainty attribute behaviour problems in an individual child to prenatal alcohol exposure. This has important clinical and legal implications. © 2012 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. All rights reserved.
