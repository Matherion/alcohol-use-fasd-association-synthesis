N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a complex malformative condition due to the teratogenic effect of alcohol consumed during pregnancy. Several epidemiological studies have shown that maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is the most common preventable cause of mental retardation in childhood. The effects of alcohol on the fetus range from abortion to a spectrum of clinical manifestations called FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders) that include partial FAS (PFAS), neonatal alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (ARND) up to the most severe disease defined as FAS.

N2  - Objectives Classical eyeblink conditioning (EBC), an elemental form of learning, is among the most sensitive indicators of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The cerebellum plays a key role in maintaining timed movements with millisecond accuracy required for EBC. Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to identify cerebellar regions that mediate timing in healthy controls and the degree to which these areas are also recruited in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Experimental design fMRI data were acquired during an auditory rhythmic/non-rhythmic finger tapping task. We present results for 17 children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS, 17 heavily exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children and 16 non- or minimally exposed controls. Principal observations Controls showed greater cerebellar blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation in right crus I, vermis IV-VI, and right lobule VI during rhythmic than non-rhythmic finger tapping. The alcohol-exposed children showed smaller activation increases during rhythmic tapping in right crus I than the control children and the most severely affected children with either FAS or PFAS showed smaller increases in vermis IV-V. Higher levels of maternal alcohol intake per occasion during pregnancy were associated with reduced activation increases during rhythmic tapping in all four regions associated with rhythmic tapping in controls. Conclusions The four cerebellar areas activated by the controls more during rhythmic than non-rhythmic tapping have been implicated in the production of timed responses in several previous studies. These data provide evidence linking binge-like drinking during pregnancy to poorer function in cerebellar regions involved in timing and somatosensory processing needed for complex tasks requiring precise timing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Risky drinking among Russian women constitutes a significant risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP). Russian women report that obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physicians are the most important source of information about alcohol consumption during pregnancy and developing effective prevention interventions by OB/GYNs is indicated. This is the first study focused on implementation of an AEP prevention intervention at women's clinics in Russia., METHOD: The paper describes the intervention protocol and addresses questions about the feasibility of a brief FASD prevention intervention delivered by OB/GYNs at women's clinics in Russia. Brief physician intervention guidelines and two evidence-based FASD prevention interventions were utilized to design a brief dual-focused physician intervention (DFBPI) appropriate to Russian OB/GYN care. The questions answered were whether trained OB/GYN physicians could deliver DFBPI during women's routine clinic visits, whether they maintained skills over time in clinical settings, and which specific intervention components were better maintained. Data were collected as part of a larger study aimed at evaluating effectiveness of DFBPI in reducing AEP risk in non-pregnant women. Methods of monitoring the intervention delivery included fidelity check lists (FCL) with the key components of the intervention completed by physicians and patients and live and audio taped observations of intervention sessions. Physicians (N = 23) and women (N = 372) independently completed FCL, and 78 audiotapes were coded., RESULTS: The differences between women's and physicians' reports on individual items were not significant. Although the majority of physician and patient reports were consistent (N = 305), a discrepancy existed between the reports in 57 cases. Women reported more intervention components missing compared to physicians (p < 0.001). Discussing barriers was the most difficult component for physicians to implement, and OB/GYN demonstrated difficulties in discussing contraception methods., CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the feasibility of the DFBPI in Russia. OB/GYN physicians trained in the DFBPI, monitored, and supported were able to implement and maintain skills during the study. In addition to the alcohol focus, DFBPI training needs to have a sufficient component to improve physicians' skills in discussing contraception use.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and associated behavioral impairments that may be linked to disruptions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Social and physical enrichment has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach toward reversing behavioral deficits associated with FASD and is also a potent stimulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In the present study, we utilized a genetic fate mapping approach in nestin-CreER(T2)/YFP bitransgenic mice to identify the stage-specific impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on the stepwise maturation of adult hippocampal progenitors. Using a limited alcohol access "drinking-in-the-dark" model of FASD, we confirm previous findings that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure has no effect on adult neurogenesis under standard housing conditions, but abolishes the neurogenic response to enriched environment (EE). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this effect is primarily due to failed EE-mediated survival of postmitotic neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that the neurogenic deficit is associated with impaired spatial pattern recognition, as demonstrated by delayed learning of FASD-EE mice in an A-B contextual discrimination task. These results identify a potential maturational stage-specific mechanism(s) underlying impaired neurogenic function in a preclinical model of FASD, and provide a basis for testing regulatory pathways in this model through conditional and inducible manipulation of gene expression in the adult hippocampal progenitor population.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study assesses factors that contribute to alcohol consumption during pregnancy and identifies potential intervention strategies to reduce consumption., METHODS: The study sample includes 142 pregnant women who attended a public hospital for prenatal health care in Perth, Western Australia. All participants returned a self-completion survey., RESULTS: Women who discontinued drinking during pregnancy were significantly more likely to be engaged in full time home duties and had completed less formal education. Women who continued to drink were more likely to have drunk in previous pregnancies and during the preconception period. Nearly 40% of high risk women reported a negative comment in response to their drinking. One-third of women in the risky group were advised by a health professional not to drink alcohol. Women were most likely to drink in their own home or at the home of a friend., CONCLUSIONS: Participatory research with women who drink while pregnant can assist in identifying potential intervention strategies that have resonance with this group and therefore more potential for creating behaviour change. Implications. The World Health Organization recognises, and has done for over 10 years, that alcohol use during pregnancy which results in Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is the leading cause of environmental-related birth defects and mental retardation in the Western world.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to assess the rate of misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among a population of foster and adopted youth referred to a children's mental health center. METHODS: Data were collected from a sample of 547 children who underwent a comprehensive multidisciplinary diagnostic evaluation. Utilizing current diagnostic criteria, children were diagnosed, as appropriate, with fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, or alcohol-related birth defects. Changes in rates of alcohol exposure-related diagnoses and cooccurring mental health disorders pre- and postassessment were analyzed by using McNemar's test for dependent proportions. RESULTS: Among 156 children and adolescents who met criteria for a diagnosis within the fetal alcohol spectrum, 125 had never been diagnosed as affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, a missed diagnosis rate of 80.1%. Of the 31 who had been recognized before referral as affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, 10 children's FASD diagnoses were changed within the spectrum, representing a misdiagnosis rate of 6.4%. The remaining 21 (13.5%) children's diagnoses stayed the same. There also were significant changes in the rate of mental health diagnosis, and learning disorders, communication disorders, and intellectual disability, objective signs of neurocognitive damage, were not recognized in a significant number of children with FASD. CONCLUSIONS: Within this clinical sample, 86.5% of youth with FASD had never been previously diagnosed or had been misdiagnosed. These high rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis have significant implications for intervention and therapeutic services.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which may underlie some of the behavioral and adaptive problems seen in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol show altered basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond 2 years of age. It is also unknown if cortisol levels can be normalized through intervention programs. In this study, we investigated the effects of a physical activity program for children with FASD to determine: 1) if HPA dysregulation persists in school-age children with FASD, and 2) the effect of our program on cortisol levels. Twenty six children (ages 6-14 years) with FASD participated in an 8 week motor skill development program. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 24 children and compared at 4 time points: before, immediately after, 3 months, and 1 year after program completion. Cortisol levels were also compared to 32 control children to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: awakening, after school, and just before bedtime. Cortisol levels were significantly higher in the afternoon and at bedtime in children with FASD with confirmed prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol (alcohol exposure rank 4), compared with Control children or children with FASD with exposure to low or unknown levels of alcohol (alcohol exposure rank 3). The program did not significantly affect cortisol levels in children with FASD as a group. These results provide support for long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the HPA system in humans, which could increase vulnerability to mental health issues and diseases later in life.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the number one cause of preventable mental retardation. An estimated 2-5% of children are diagnosed as having a FASD. While it is known that children prenatally exposed to alcohol experience cognitive deficits and a higher incidence of psychiatric illness later in life, the pathways underlying these abnormalities remain uncertain. GSK3beta and CDK5 are protein kinases that are converging points for a vast number of signaling cascades, including those controlling cellular processes critical to learning and memory. We investigated whether levels of GSK3beta and CDK5 are affected by moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), specifically in the hippocampus and medial frontal cortex of the adolescent mouse. In the present work we utilized immunoblotting techniques to demonstrate that moderate PAE increased hippocampal p35 and beta-catenin, and decreased total levels of GSK3beta, while increasing GSK3beta Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation. Interestingly, different alterations were seen in the medial frontal cortex where p35 and CDK5 were decreased and increased total GSK3beta was accompanied by reduced Tyr216 of the enzyme. These results suggest that kinase dysregulation during adolescence might be an important contributing factor to the effects of PAE on hippocampal and medial frontal cortical functioning; and by extension, that global modulation of these kinases may produce differing effects depending on brain region.

N2  - The significant consequences of ethanol use during pregnancy are neurobehavioral abnormalities involving hippocampal and neocortex malfunctions that cause learning and memory deficits collectively named fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are still poorly understood and therefore warrant systematic research. Here, we document novel epigenetic abnormalities in the mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Ethanol treatment of P7 mice, which induces activation of caspase 3, impaired DNA methylation through reduced DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3A) levels. Inhibition of caspase 3 activity, before ethanol treatment, rescued DNMT1, DNMT3A proteins as well as DNA methylation levels. Blockade of histone methyltransferase (G9a) activity or cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1R), prior to ethanol treatment, which, respectively, inhibits or prevents activation of caspase 3, rescued the DNMT1 and DNMT3A proteins and DNA methylation. No reduction of DNMT1 and DNMT3A proteins and DNA methylation was found in P7 CB1R null mice, which exhibit no ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3. Together, these data demonstrate that ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3 impairs DNA methylation through DNMT1 and DNMT3A in the neonatal mouse brain, and such impairments are absent in CB1R null mice. Epigenetic events mediated by DNA methylation may be one of the essential mechanisms of ethanol teratogenesis.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: An overview for pediatric and adolescent care providers
A1  - Senturias Y.S.N.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a term used to describe the spectrum of conditions associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. These are characterized by facial dysmorphia, growth deficits and central nervous system abnormalities. FASDs are the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability in the United States and have high financial costs. Therefore, efforts at prevention are paramount. When an individual with an FASD goes undiagnosed and when appropriate interventions are not instituted, secondary disabilities such as substance abuse, school dropout, and criminal involvement are common with corresponding suffering endured by both the affected individual and the family. The diagnostic process opens up access to existing tools and resources, including the new American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) FASD algorithm for the evaluation of FASDs, the new AAP FASD toolkit and evidence-based interventions specific to FASDs. Pediatric and adolescent clinicians are challenged to participate in the continuum of care from FASD prevention to identification, diagnosis, and management, including provision of supportive services for families in order for clinicians to make a difference in this 100% preventable disorder. © 2014 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Background: Detection of in-pregnancy maternal risk alcohol drinking is an essential first step in preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and the widely used T-ACE screen was developed for that purpose. We recently reported that increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point from 2 to 3 doubled specificity of detecting risk drinking in pregnancy and identified 4-year-old children with neurobehavioral effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: In this study, the TACER-3 was further validated in another prospectively identified high-risk urban cohort. Women were categorized as follows: (i) Not At-Risk Group (negative on T-ACE and TACER-3); (ii) At-Risk Group (positive on T-ACE and TACER-3); and (iii) Change Risk Group (positive on T-ACE but negative on TACER-3). Results: The TACER-3 total score cut-point of 3 yielded fewer "false positives" than the T-ACE cut-point of 2. Based on relative risk scores, women in the TACER-3-positive At-Risk Group were more likely to drink alcohol during pregnancy than women in the Change Risk Group. In contrast, women in the Not At-Risk Group were largely not different in their drinking from women in the Change Risk Group. The largest increases in relative risk of the At-Risk Group compared to the Change Risk Group were for the amount of drinking per day across pregnancy (RR = 11.4) and for the amount of drinking per drinking day at the first prenatal visit (RR = 12.7). For both of these measures, the relative risk of at-risk alcohol consumption in the At-Risk Group was over >10 times that of the Change Risk Group. Conclusions: Thus, the TACER-3 was more effective at selectively identifying women drinking at fetal risk levels than the original T-ACE. The TACER-3 allows for more efficient use of healthcare provider time in directing targeted clinical interventions with pregnant women identified as drinking at fetal risk levels. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Plasma or circulating miRNAs (cirmiRNAs) have potential diagnostic value as biomarkers for a range of diseases. Based on observations that ethanol (EtOH) altered intracellular miRNAs during development, we tested the hypothesis that plasma miRNAs were biomarkers for maternal alcohol exposure, and for past in utero exposure, in the neonate. Methods: Pregnant sheep were exposed to a binge model of EtOH consumption resulting in an average peak blood alcohol content of 243 mg/dl, for a third-trimester-equivalent period from gestational day 4 (GD4) to GD132. MiRNA profiles were assessed by quantitative PCR analysis in plasma, erythrocyte, and leukocytes obtained from nonpregnant ewes, and plasma from pregnant ewes 24 hours following the last binge EtOH episode, and from newborn lambs, at birth on ~GD147. Results: Pregnant ewe and newborn lamb cirmiRNA profiles were similar to each other and different from nonpregnant female plasma, erythrocyte, or leukocyte miRNAs. Significant changes in cirmiRNA profiles were observed in the EtOH-exposed ewe and, at birth, in the in utero, EtOH-exposed lamb. CirmiRNAs including miR-9, -15b, -19b, and -20a were sensitive and specific measures of EtOH exposure in both pregnant ewe and newborn lamb. Additionally, EtOH exposure altered guide-to-passenger strand cirmiRNA ratios in the pregnant ewe, but not in the lamb. Conclusions: Shared profiles between pregnant dam and neonate suggest possible maternal-fetal miRNA transfer. CirmiRNAs are biomarkers for alcohol exposure during pregnancy, in both mother and neonate, and may constitute an important shared endocrine biomarker that is vulnerable to the maternal environment. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Identifying maternal risk factors associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: a systematic review
A1  - Esper L.H.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - To identify the demographic, psychological, and social maternal risk factors associated with the development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). A bibliographic search was conducted in PubMed, SciELO, Lilacs, Web of Knowledge, and PsycINFO. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the studies with case-control design. Articles were selected based on their relevance and presentation of data related to statistical comparisons of at least one or more demographic, psychological, or social maternal risk factors for FASD. 738 references were identified, of which 15 met the criteria to be included in the present review. Mothers of FASD children tend to: be older at the time of birth of the affected child, present lower educational level, have other family relatives with alcohol abuse, have other children with FASD, present a pattern of little prenatal care and a distinguishing pattern of alcohol consumption (alcohol use before and during pregnancy, failure to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy, and frequent episodes of binge drinking). Application of the NOS scale of methodological quality indicated that 8 studies (53 %) met the criterion for selection, 4 (27 %) were suitable for the criterion for comparability and only 4 studies were suitable for the exposition criterion. Mothers of FASD children have a distinctive pattern of drinking and accumulate several social risk factors. Maternal age at birth of the child seems to accentuate the risk. There are, however, few controlled studies that are adequate according to the NOS requirements for methodological quality. Fewer are based on the verification of a theoretical model. Clinicians should be aware of the relevance of preventive assessment of FASD risk mothers.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is responsible for a broad range of brain structural malformations, which can be studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Advanced MRI methods have emerged to characterize brain abnormalities, but the teratogenic effects of alcohol on cortical morphology have received little attention to date. Twenty-four 9-year-old children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (9 with fetal alcohol syndrome, 15 heavy exposed nonsyndromal children) and 16 age-matched controls were studied to assess the effect of alcohol consumption during pregnancy on cortical morphology. An automated method was applied to 3D T1-weighted images to assess cortical gyrification using global and regional sulcal indices and two region-based morphological measurements, mean sulcal depth and fold opening. Increasing levels of alcohol exposure were related to reduced cortical folding complexity, even among children with normal brain size, indicating a reduction of buried cortical surface. Fold opening was the strongest anatomical correlate of prenatal alcohol intake, indicating a widening of sulci in all regions that were examined. These data identify cortical morphology as a suitable marker for further investigation of brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - South Africa has the highest rate of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the world. While efforts have been made to curb the high rate of FAS, little is known about situational factors that may contribute to alcohol use during pregnancy. In the current paper, we focus on the role of food insecurity and its relationship to alcohol use among pregnant women. Women completed computer-assisted interviews. Generalized linear modeling was used in all analyses. Women attending alcohol-serving establishments in a township in Cape Town, South Africa were recruited for the study. Five hundred sixty women were sampled and 95 women reported being pregnant. High levels of alcohol use were reported among pregnant women: 65 % of women consumed alcohol at least every month and 29 % consumed alcohol as often as two to three times per week. Thirty-four percent of the women reported having six or more drinks per occasion on at least a weekly basis. The majority (87 %) of pregnant women reported experiencing some form of food insecurity (e.g., food unavailable, eating less) in the past month. Alcohol use was significantly associated with food insecurity, even when controlling for relevant demographic variables. Intervention with pregnant women who consume alcohol is urgently needed. Future research should focus on understanding the intersection of food insecurity and alcohol, and how the experience of food insecurity may contribute to greater rates of alcohol use and abuse among pregnant women.

T1  - Autophagy and ethanol neurotoxicity
A1  - Luo J.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Excessive ethanol exposure is detrimental to the brain. The developing brain is particularly vulnerable to ethanol such that prenatal ethanol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Neuronal loss in the brain is the most devastating consequence and is associated with mental retardation and other behavioral deficits observed in FASD. Since alcohol consumption during pregnancy has not declined, it is imperative to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop effective therapeutic strategies. One cellular mechanism that acts as a protective response for the central nervous system (CNS) is autophagy. Autophagy regulates lysosomal turnover of organelles and proteins within cells, and is involved in cell differentiation, survival, metabolism, and immunity. We have recently shown that ethanol activates autophagy in the developing brain. The autophagic preconditioning alleviates ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis, whereas inhibition of autophagy potentiates ethanol-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exacerbates ethanol-induced neuroapoptosis. The expression of genes encoding proteins required for autophagy in the CNS is developmentally regulated; their levels are much lower during an ethanol-sensitive period than during an ethanol-resistant period. Ethanol may stimulate autophagy through multiple mechanisms; these include induction of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, modulation of MTOR and AMPK signaling, alterations in BCL2 family proteins, and disruption of intracellular calcium (Ca2C) homeostasis. This review discusses the most recent evidence regarding the involvement of autophagy in ethanolmediated neurotoxicity as well as the potential therapeutic approach of targeting autophagic pathways.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a prenatal disease characterized by fetal morphological and neurological abnormalities originating from exposure to alcohol. Although FAS is a well-described pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying its progression are virtually unknown. Moreover, alcohol abuse can affect vitamin metabolism and absorption, although how alcohol impairs such biochemical pathways remains to be elucidated. We employed a variety of systems chemo-biology tools to understand the interplay between ethanol metabolism and vitamins during mouse neurodevelopment. For this purpose, we designed interactomes and employed transcriptomic data analysis approaches to study the neural tissue of Mus musculus exposed to ethanol prenatally and postnatally, simulating conditions that could lead to FAS development at different life stages. Our results showed that FAS can promote early changes in neurotransmitter release and glutamate equilibrium, as well as an abnormal calcium influx that can lead to neuroinflammation and impaired neurodifferentiation, both extensively connected with vitamin action and metabolism. Genes related to retinoic acid, niacin, vitamin D, and folate metabolism were underexpressed during neurodevelopment and appear to contribute to neuroinflammation progression and impaired synapsis. Our results also indicate that genes coding for tubulin, tubulin-associated proteins, synapse plasticity proteins, and proteins related to neurodifferentiation are extensively affected by ethanol exposure. Finally, we developed a molecular model of how ethanol can affect vitamin metabolism and impair neurodevelopment.

N2  - CONCLUSIONS: The lower NAA levels seen in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure may reflect impaired neuronal integrity in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Our finding of lower Cho points to disrupted Cho metabolism of membrane phospholipids, reflecting altered neuropil development with potentially reduced content of dendrites and synapses. The alcohol-related alterations in Glx may suggest a disruption of the glutamate-glutamine cycling involved in glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission., BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to impairment in cerebellar structure and function, including eyeblink conditioning. The deep cerebellar nuclei, which play a critical role in cerebellar-mediated learning, receive extensive inputs from brain stem and cerebellar cortex and provide the point of origin for most of the output fibers to other regions of the brain. We used in vivo (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurochemistry in this important cerebellar region., METHODS: MRS data from the deep cerebellar nuclei were acquired from 37 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 17 non- or minimally exposed controls from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa., RESULTS: Increased maternal alcohol consumption around time of conception was associated with lower N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the deep nuclei (r = -0.33, p < 0.05). Higher levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to lower levels of the choline-containing metabolites (r = -0.37, p < 0.01), glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine (Cho). Alcohol consumption levels both at conception (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and during pregnancy (r = 0.38, p < 0.01) were related to higher levels of glutamate plus glutamine (Glx). All these effects continued to be significant after controlling for potential confounders.

N2  - Background: Maternal risk factors for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in Italy and Mediterranean cultures need clarification, as there are few studies and most are plagued by inaccurate reporting of antenatal alcohol use. Methods: Maternal interviews (n= 905) were carried out in a population-based study of the prevalence and characteristics of FASD in the Lazio region of Italy which provided data for multivariate case control comparisons and multiple correlation models. Results: Case control findings from interviews seven years post-partum indicate that mothers of children with FASD are significantly more likely than randomly-selected controls or community mothers to: be shorter; have higher body mass indexes (BMI); be married to a man with legal problems; report more drinking three months pre-pregnancy; engage in more current drinking and drinking alone and have alcohol problems in her family. Logistic regression analysis of multiple candidate predictors of a FASD diagnosis indicates that alcohol problems in the child's family is the most significant risk factor, making a diagnosis within the continuum of FASD 9 times more likely (95%. C.I.= 1.6 to 50.7). Sequential multiple regression analysis of the child's neuropsychological performance also identifies alcohol problems in the child's family as the only significant maternal risk variable (p< .001) when controlling for other potential risk factors. Conclusions: Underreporting of prenatal alcohol use has been demonstrated among Italian and other Mediterranean antenatal samples, and it was suspected in this sample. Nevertheless, several significant maternal risk factors for FASD have been identified.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) and believed to be the leading known cause of developmental disabilities in the United States. Our objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) intervention may reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women in Southern California. Methods: Southern California AIAN women of childbearing age who completed a survey including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use were randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former group completed an online SBIRT intervention, and were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. Results: Of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, one-third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior (drinks per week, p < 0.001; frequency of heavy episodic [binge] drinking episodes per 2 weeks, p = 0.017 and risk of AEP p < 0.001 at 6 months postintervention) in the follow-up period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Baseline factors associated with decreased risk of an AEP at follow-up included the perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per week, having reported a greater number of binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, and depression/impaired functionality. Conclusions: Participation in assessment alone may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the web-based SBIRT intervention. Randomization to the SBIRT did not result in a significantly different change in risky drinking behaviors. The importance of perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/functionality may have implications for future interventions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This is the first national study worldwide that objectively measures the rate of heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Meconium analysis of the established biomarker of in utero alcohol exposure, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) is used as an objective measure of heavy alcohol exposure. METHODS: In collaboration with the MIREC study, 2,000 pregnant women were recruited across Canada, with 1,537 consenting to meconium analysis. Meconium samples were analyzed for 4 FAEEs via GC-MS analysis. A positive sample has a total [FAEE] greater than 2 nmol/g. Alcohol self-report was collected via questionnaire and compared to analytical results. The rate of false-positive results increases in a predictable manner with delayed sample collection and is accounted for in incidence rate calculation. RESULTS: Thus far, 690 samples have been processed with 609 eligible for analysis. Analysis results with maternal alcohol consumption self-report data are summarized in the table. The incidence rate of heavy fetal alcohol exposure in Canada was 2.55%. CONCLUSION: This study is the first of its kind to objectively measure the rate of heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Canada. Because 40% of heavily exposed fetuses develop FASD, our study predicts a rate of at least 1% of FASD in Canada, corresponding to 3,750 new cases yearly. (Table Presented).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are thought to be a leading cause of developmental disabilities worldwide. However, data are lacking on alcohol use among pregnant women in many countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of alcohol consumption by pregnant women in Ukraine., METHODS: Cross-sectional screening of pregnant women was conducted in 2 regions of Ukraine during the recruitment phase of an ongoing clinical study that is part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. Women attending a routine prenatal visit at 1 of 2 participating regional centers were asked about alcohol consumption. Quantity and frequency of alcoholic beverages consumed in the month around conception and in the most recent month of pregnancy were measured using a standard interview instrument., RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2012, 11,909 pregnant women were screened on average in the second trimester of pregnancy. Of these, 92.7% reported being ever-drinkers. Among ever-drinkers, 54.8% reported drinking alcohol in the month around conception and 12.9% consumed at least 3 drinks on at least 1 day in that time period. In the most recent month of pregnancy, 46.3% continued to report alcohol use and 9.2% consumed at least 3 drinks per day. Significant predictors of average number of drinks or heavier drinking per day in either time period in pregnancy included lower gravidity, being single, unmarried/living with a partner, or separated, lower maternal education, smoking, younger age at initiation of drinking, and higher score on the TWEAK screening test for harmful drinking., CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the need for education/intervention in women of childbearing age in Ukraine and can help inform targeted interventions for women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The initiation of a standard screening protocol in pregnancy is a step in the right direction.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol significantly alters the developmental trajectory of progenitor cells and fundamentally compromises tissue formation (i.e., histogenesis). Emerging research suggests that ethanol can impair mammalian development by interfering with the execution of molecular programs governing differentiation. For example, ethanol exposure disrupts cellular migration, changes cell-cell interactions, and alters growth factor signaling pathways. Additionally, ethanol can alter epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression. Normally, lineage-specific regulatory factors (i.e., transcription factors) establish the transcriptional networks of each new cell type; the cell's identity then is maintained through epigenetic alterations in the way in which the DNA encoding each gene becomes packaged within the chromatin. Ethanol exposure can induce epigenetic changes that do not induce genetic mutations but nonetheless alter the course of fetal development and result in a large array of patterning defects. Two crucial enzyme complexes-the Polycomb and Trithorax proteins-are central to the epigenetic programs controlling the intricate balance between self-renewal and the execution of cellular differentiation, with diametrically opposed functions. Prenatal ethanol exposure may disrupt the functions of these two enzyme complexes, altering a crucial aspect of mammalian differentiation. Characterizing the involvement of Polycomb and Trithorax group complexes in the etiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders will undoubtedly enhance understanding of the role that epigenetic programming plays in this complex disorder.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) is embedded in a matrix of biological, social and ethical processes, making it an important topic for crossdisciplinary social and ethical research. This article reviews different branches of research relevant to understanding how FASD is identified and defined and outlines a framework for future social and ethical research in this area. We outline the character of scientific research into FASD, epidemiological discrepancies between reported patterns of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the incidence of FASD, and the social and ethical considerations that may impact on who is, and is not, diagnosed. We highlight what further research investigating FASD diagnostic processes, as well as the multi-generational impacts of FASD, is needed. Important research priorities are to: 1) enumerate the variety of stakeholders involved in seeking FASD diagnoses; 2) understand the experiences and perspectives of mothers from different backgrounds who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy and their affected children; and 3) collect health histories of maternal alcohol consumption in families to determine the effect of FASD at sub-cultural and cultural levels.

N2  - Background: There is an emerging literature suggesting that structural abnormalities exist in offspring from families selected to have multiple members with alcohol dependence. Structures previously identified by manual tracing techniques include the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, regions involved in emotional processing. Deficits in social cognition have been reported in alcoholic patients with a suggestion that these deficits may be linked to prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. It is possible that the prefrontal cortex may be more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol experienced from either personal or prenatal exposure, or both. Alternatively, familial risk for alcohol dependence may predispose individuals to PFC structural abnormalities. Voxel based morphometry (VBM) is well suited to uncovering whole brain differences between ultra high risk offspring and controls. While most studies have selected families through an alcohol dependent father, understanding the contribution that familial maternal alcoholism has on offspring that is independent of any fetal alcohol exposure effects that the offspring experience provides an opportunity to identify pathophysiologic mechanisms that may be unique to each. With this information targeted interventions could be developed. We hypothesized that decreased gray matter volumes might be seen in the high risk offspring relative to controls in cortical structures and include those associated with facial recognition and social cognition. Also, we hypothesized that comparison of high risk offspring with and without prenatal exposure would reveal new regions unique to exposure. Methods: Structural MRI scans at 3.0 Tesla were obtained from 43 high risk offspring (Mean age 27.4+3.6 years) and 45 low-risk controls (Mean age 24.5+4.1 years). Substance use during pregnancy was obtained from mothers at a time when the young adult participants were studied as children as part of a longitudinal study. Within the high-risk group 16 offspring were exposed to alcohol and 25 were not providing an opportunity to determine which regions differed by familial risk and those due to alcohol exposure. Structural data preprocessing and analysis for this study was performed with the VBM8 toolbox (http://dbm.neuro. uni-jena.de/vbm/) within the SPM8 software (http:// www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) running on MATLAB R2014a (Mathworks). Preprocessing steps in VBM8 toolbox involves bias correction, tissue segmentation, affine registration, normalization, and modulation. Finally, modulated images were smoothed with a full-width half-maximum kernel of 12 mm. Statistical analyses were performed on these smooth images. The resulting maps were thresholded with p<0.001 with a cluster size of 50 voxels. Additionally, regional volumes were calculated using the MarsBaR ROI toolbox (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net) to compare the volume of the specified regions of interests (ROIs) which were further compared in SPSS (version 20). Results: Whole brain analysis revealed clusters in the middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and insula, regions associated with face processing in which high-risk offspring had lesser gray matter than low-risk controls. Also, found were areas of reduced gray matter in the uncus, cuneus, precuneous, claustrum, and caudate. Whole brain analysis was performed within the high risk group to assess the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on gray matter volumes. In this comparison, clusters were identified within the middle frontal, and middle temporal gyri along with the precuneus and anterior cingulate in which exposed offspring had reduced gray matter compared to those that were not exposed. One area showed greater gray matter volume in the exposed offspring, the culmen portion of the right anterior lobe of cerebellum. Region of interest analysis revealed four areas associated with facial processing with lesser gray matter in association with familial risk: the fusiform gyrus (p=0.001), middle temporal gyrus (p=0.024), insula (p=0.042) in the left hemisphere and the orbitofrontal cortex in the right hemisphere (0.040). Analyses using prenatal exposure to alcohol or cigarettes continued to show risk group differences as did analyses in which presence of SUD before the scans was used as a covariate. Correlational analysis between these regions shows highly related structural connectivity with all intercorrelations significant at< 0.001. Conclusions: The fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, insula and orbitofrontal cortex have previously been linked to facial affect perception and social cognition. The present results indicate lesser gray matter volumes in these regions in individuals at ultra high risk for developing alcohol dependence and other substance use disorders. Moreover, the results suggest that the neural underpinnings of social cognitive impairment may be present before these individuals' development substance use disorders.

N2  - Background: Repeated exposure to environmental adversity during development can cause treatment resistant, refractory depression. Although genetic research has revealed that the vulnerability to depression is partially heritable, there is also strong support for the pathogenic role of early environmental adversity in the development and expression of this disorder. Prenatal alcohol exposure has been identified as a potential risk factor for refractory depression and a high rate of comorbid depression has been reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) patients. Stem cell-based regenerative therapy is considered a promising cellular therapeutic approach for some patients with incurable brain diseases. Previously, we found that intravenous neural stem cell (NSC) treatment reversed impaired memory/cognitive function and social interaction behaviors in rats tested using a fetal alcohol exposure-induced psychiatric disorder model. Methods: In this study, we tested this approach to treat the refractory type of depression model rats caused by the combined stress exposures to prenatal ethanol and adolescent corticosterone treatments. Results: We showed that aspects of depressive-like behavior resulting from a forced swim test were reversed by the combined treatment of an antidepressant and the intravenous administration of fetal rat brain derived NSCs with atelocollagen which was used for reducing immune rejection and for potentiate effective migration of administrated cells into the brain. In addition, we showed that alterations of PV-containing GABAergic interneurons and synaptic density protein levels resulting from the combined treatment of antidepressant and NSCs in this model. Conclusions: Our results established a new role for PVcontaining GABAergic interneurons associated with treatment resistant, refractory depression-like behavior in rats and suggested possible new therapeutic options of stem cell therapies for treating refractory types of psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a birth defect due to maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the main somatic stem cells in adults and may contribute to tissue homeostasis and repair in adulthood, we investigated whether early life ethanol exposure affects MSCs and contributes to the propensity for disease onset in later life. Using a rodent model of FAS, we found that ethanol exposure (5.25 g/kg/day) from postnatal days 4 to 9 in rat pups (mimic of human third trimester) caused long-term anomalies in bone marrow-derived MSCs. MSCs isolated from ethanol-exposed animals were prone to neural induction but resistant to osteogenic and adipogenic inductions compared to their age-matched controls. The altered differentiation may contribute to the severe trabecular bone loss seen in ethanol-exposed animals at 3 months of age as well as overt growth retardation. Expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, aP2, and PPAR were substantially inhibited, but BDNF was up-regulated in MSCs isolated from ethanol-exposed 3 month-old animals. Several signaling pathways were distorted in ethanol-exposed MSCs via altered trimethylation at histone 3 lysine 27. These results demonstrate that early life ethanol exposure can have long-term impacts in rat MSCs by both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.

T1  - Embryo transfers between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice: Examination of a maternal effect on ethanol teratogenesis
A1  - Gilliam D.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Genetic factors influence fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) in both humans and animals. Experiments using inbred and selectively bred mouse stocks that controlled for (1) ethanol dose, (2) maternal and fetal blood ethanol levels, and (3) fetal developmental exposure stage, show genotype can affect teratogenic outcome. Other experiments distinguish the teratogenic effects mediated by maternal genotype from those mediated by fetal genotype. One technique to distinguish maternal versus fetal genotype effect is to utilize embryo transfers. This study is the first to examine ethanol teratogenesis - fetal weight deficits and mortality, and digit, kidney, and vertebral malformations - in C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) fetuses that were transferred as blastocysts into B6 and D2 dams. We hypothesized that, following maternal alcohol exposure, B6 and D2 fetuses gestating within B6 mothers, as compared to D2 mothers, will exhibit a higher frequency of malformations. On day 9 of pregnancy, females were intubated (IG) with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or maltose-dextrin (MD). Other females were mated within strain and treated with either ethanol or maltose, or were not exposed to either treatment. Implantation rates were affected by genotype. Results show more B6 embryos implanted into D2 females than B6 females (p < 0.05; 47% vs. 23%, respectively). There was no difference in the percentage of D2 embryos implanting into B6 and D2 females (14 and 16%, respectfully). Litter mortality averaged 24% across all experimental groups. Overall, in utero ethanol exposure reduced mean litter weight compared to maltose treatment (E = 1.01 g; MD = 1.19 g; p < 0.05); but maltose exposed litters with transferred embryos weighed more than similarly treated natural litters (1.30 g vs. 1.11 g; p < 0.05). Approximately 50% of all ethanol exposed B6 fetuses exhibited some malformation (digit, vertebral, and/or kidney) regardless of whether they were transferred into a B6 or D2 female, or were naturally conceived. This suggests the D2 maternal uterine environment did not offer any protection against ethanol teratogenesis for B6 fetuses. One of the questions remaining is the how the B6 uterine environment affects D2 teratogenesis. No definitive conclusions can be drawn because too few viable D2 litters were produced.

N2  - Objectives To estimate incidence and prevalence of FASD by sex and age in Alberta, Canada., Methods We included all patients recorded in the Alberta provincial health databases of inpatients, outpatients, and practitioner claims from 2003 to 2012. The number of people with FASD were calculated from available data on FAS (ICD-9 code 760.71; ICD-10 codes Q86.0 and P04.3) and estimated prevalence of FASD among individuals diagnosed with 21 FASD-related conditions (identified by a literature review) for which there are ICD codes, such as learning disability, mental retardation, and nervous system defects (Table 1). Fractions of FASD-related diagnoses that can be attributed to alcohol use during pregnancy were estimated by a systematic review. The incidence was measured as the number of new cases per 1000 births. The prevalence was measured as the number of cases per 1000 population in 2012., Results Annually, 739 to 1884 people were born with FASD in Alberta establishing an incidence of 14.2 to 43.8 per 1000 births, depending on the length of follow-up. There were about 46,000 people living with FASD in Alberta 2012, including 6,000 FAS cases and 40,000 FASD-related cases. The prevalence of FASD was 11.7 (range 8.2 to 15.1) per 1000 population. The incidence and prevalence varied greatly by sex and age group. Generally, male and younger outnumbered female and older., Conclusion This study suggests new incidence and prevalence of FASD, which are higher than what has been commonly used (1%), and its variations among sex and age groups.

N2  - Reductions in brain volumes represent a neurobiological signature of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Less clear is how regional brain tissue reductions differ after normalizing for brain size differences linked with FASD and whether these profiles can predict the degree of prenatal exposure to alcohol. To examine associations of regional brain tissue excesses/deficits with degree of prenatal alcohol exposure and diagnosis with and without correction for overall brain volume, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) methods were applied to structural imaging data from a well-characterized, demographically homogeneous sample of children diagnosed with FASD (n = 39, 9.6-11.0 years) and controls (n = 16, 9.5-11.0 years). Degree of prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated with regionally pervasive brain tissue reductions in: (1) the thalamus, midbrain, and ventromedial frontal lobe, (2) the superior cerebellum and inferior occipital lobe, (3) the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and (4) the precuneus and superior parietal lobule. When overall brain size was factored out of the analysis on a subject-by-subject basis, no regions showed significant associations with alcohol exposure. FASD diagnosis was associated with a similar deformation pattern, but few of the regions survived FDR correction. In data-driven independent component analyses (ICA) regional brain tissue deformations successfully distinguished individuals based on extent of prenatal alcohol exposure and to a lesser degree, diagnosis. The greater sensitivity of the continuous measure of alcohol exposure compared with the categorical diagnosis across diverse brain regions underscores the dose dependence of these effects. The ICA results illustrate that profiles of brain tissue alterations may be a useful indicator of prenatal alcohol exposure when reliable historical data are not available and facial features are not apparent.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a wide range of deficits in executive function that persist throughout life, but little is known about how changes in brain structure relate to cognition in affected individuals. In the current study, we predicted that the rate of white matter volumetric development would be atypical in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) when compared to typically developing children, and that the rate of change in cognitive function would relate to differential white matter development between groups. Data were available for 103 subjects [49 with FASD, 54 controls, age range 6-17, mean age = 11.83] with 153 total observations. Groups were age-matched. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an executive function (EF) battery. Using white matter volumes measured bilaterally for frontal and parietal regions and the corpus callosum, change was predicted by modeling the effects of age, intracranial volume, sex, and interactions with exposure status and EF measures. While both groups showed regional increases in white matter volumes and improvement in cognitive performance over time, there were significant effects of exposure status on age-related relationships between white matter increases and EF measures. Specifically, individuals with FASD consistently showed a positive relationship between improved cognitive function and increased white matter volume over time, while no such relationships were seen in controls. These novel results relating improved cognitive function with increased white matter volume in FASD suggest that better cognitive outcomes could be possible for FASD subjects through interventions that enhance white matter plasticity.

N2  - Background and aims Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with several adverse outcomes for the developing child, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most well-known. In The Netherlands it is recommended not to drink any alcohol while pregnant. Our objective was to describe the prevalence and pattern of alcohol consumption during pregnancy in the Netherlands. Methods In 2007 and 2010 we undertook two nation-wide surveys amongst mothers who brought their infant aged <6 months to a well-baby clinic. Survey-data were weighted for educational attainments to represent national figures. Results In 2007 data were obtained from 2768 and in 2010 from 1448 women. Between 2007 and 2010, the frequency of drinking did not increase, but the amount per occasion did. Overall, 21% of women reported that they had drunk alcohol during pregnancy. Of women who drank alcohol during the first 3 months, 25% reported 1-3 drinking occasions per month; 7% reported weekly intake, and 0.5% reported daily intake of alcohol. Binge drinking (>6 drinks/occasion) while pregnant was reported by 8%. In 2007, 53% had <1, 40% had 1-3, and 7% had >3 drinks/occasion. In 2010 this was respectively 4%, 83%, and 13%. As compared to the first three months, in the last six months of pregnancy alcohol intake was somewhat less. Alcohol consumption in pregnancy was more prevalent amongst older (>35 years of age), higher educated women, and amongst women who reported that they had smoked tobacco products while pregnant (adj. OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.51-2.73). Conclusions Despite current recommendations, in 2007 and 2010, 21% of Dutch women drank alcohol while pregnant.

N2  - Background: Alcohol is detrimental to early development. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) due to maternal alcohol abuse results in a series of developmental abnormalities including cranial facial dysmorphology, ocular anomalies, congenital heart defects, microcephaly and intellectual disabilities. Previous studies have been shown that ethanol exposure causes neural crest (NC) apoptosis and perturbation of neural crest migration. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this report we investigated the fetal effect of alcohol on the process of neural crest development in the Xenopus leavis. Results: Pre-gastrulation exposure of 2-4% alcohol induces apoptosis in Xenopus embryo whereas 1% alcohol specifically impairs neural crest migration without observing discernible apoptosis. Additionally, 1% alcohol treatment considerably increased the phenotype of small head (43.4% +/- 4.4%, total embryo n = 234), and 1.5% and 2.0% dramatically augment the deformation to 81.2% +/- 6.5% (n = 205) and 91.6% +/- 3.0% (n = 235), respectively (P < 0.05). Significant accumulation of Homocysteine was caused by alcohol treatment in embryos and 5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate restores neural crest migration and alleviates homocysteine accumulation, resulting in inhibition of the alcohol-induced neurocristopathies. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that prenatal alcohol exposure causes neural crest cell migration abnormality and 5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate could be beneficial for treating FASD.

N2  - The Western Cape of South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) globally. Reducing alcohol use during pregnancy is a pressing public health priority for this region, but insight into the experiences of women who drink during pregnancy is lacking. Convenience sampling in alcohol-serving venues was used to identify women who were currently pregnant (. n=12) or recently post-partum (. n=12) and reported drinking during the pregnancy period. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between April and August 2013. Interviews explored drinking narratives, with textual data analyzed for themes related to factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy. All but one woman reported her pregnancy as unplanned. The majority sustained or increased drinking after pregnancy recognition, with patterns typically including multiple days of binge drinking per week. Analysis of the textual data revealed five primary factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy: 1) women used alcohol as a strategy to cope with stressors and negative emotions, including those associated with pregnancy; 2) women drank as a way to retain social connection, often during a difficult period of life transition; 3) social norms in women's peer groups supported drinking during pregnancy; 4) women lacked attachment to the pregnancy or were resistant to motherhood; and 5) women were driven physiologically by alcohol addiction. Our data suggest that alcohol-serving settings are important sites to identify and target women at risk of drinking during pregnancy. Intervention approaches to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy should include counseling and contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies, mental health and coping interventions targeting pregnant women, peer-based interventions to change norms around perinatal drinking, and treatment for alcohol dependence during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that innovative interventions that go beyond the boundaries of the health care system are urgently needed to address FASD in this region.

N2  - In the review the literature data on the effect of alcohol on the developing brain of human and animals are summarized. The information is presented on the neuroimaging, histological, cellular and molecular-genetic disturbances in the brain in fetal alcohol syndrome and following exposure to alcohol during the early postnatal period. The structural developmental abnormalities of the different parts of the brain, disorders of neurogenesis and neuronal apoptosis, changes in metabolism, receptors and secondary signals system of neurons are described. Prenatal alcohol exposure causes significant, various long-term disturbances of the brain structures at the organ, tissue, cellular and subcellular level, which may lay in the basis of the observed neurological, behavioral and metal disorders.

T1  - Protective effects of the alcohol dehydrogenase-ADH1B*3 allele on attention and behavior problems in adolescents exposed to alcohol during pregnancy

N2  - Alcohol dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of alcohol. Expression of three alleles at the ADH1B locus results in enzymes that differ in turnover rate and affinity for alcohol. The ADH1B*3 allele, which appears to be unique to individuals of African descent, is associated with more rapid alcohol metabolism than the more prevalent ADH1B*1 allele. It has been previously demonstrated that the presence of at least one maternal ADH1B*3 allele confers a protective effect against alcohol teratogenicity in infants and children. This study was conducted to determine whether the presence of the ADH1B*3 allele in the mother or child continues to be protective in alcohol-exposed individuals during adolescence. 186 adolescents and 167 mothers participating in a 14-year follow-up of the Detroit Longitudinal Cohort were genotyped for ADH1B alleles. Behavioral reports were obtained from classroom teachers. Frequencies of the ADH1B*3 allele were 17.6% in the mothers and 21.0% in the adolescents, which are consistent with the 15-20% expected for African Americans. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with increased attention problems and externalizing behaviors in adolescents born to mothers with two ADH1B*1 alleles but not in those whose mothers had at least one ADH1B*3 allele. A similar pattern was seen in relation to the presence or absence of an ADH1B*3 allele in the adolescent, which may have reflected the presence/absence of the maternal variant. This study is the first to demonstrate that the protective effects of the maternal ADH1B*3 allele continue to be evident during adolescence. These persistent individual differences in vulnerability of offspring to the behavioral effects of fetal alcohol exposure are likely attributable to more rapid metabolism of alcohol that the ADH1B*3 variant confers on the mother, leading to a reduction of the peak blood alcohol concentration to which the fetus is exposed during each drinking episode. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in long-term cognitive and behavioral deficits. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) refers to a range of permanent birth defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, and is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in the US. Studies by autopsy and conventional structural MRI indicate that the midline structures of the brain are particularly vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown that abnormalities in brain white matter especially the corpus callosum are very common in FASD. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel technique that measures tissue's magnetic property. Such magnetic property is affected by tissue microstructure and molecular composition including that of myelin in the white matter. In this work, we studied three major white matter fiber bundles of a mouse model of FASD and compared it to control mice using both QSM and DTI. QSM revealed clear and significant abnormalities in anterior commissure, corpus callosum, and hippocampal commissure, which were likely due to reduced myelination. Our data also suggested that QSM may be even more sensitive than DTI for examining changes due to prenatal alcohol exposure. Although this is a preclinical study, the technique of QSM is readily translatable to human brain.

N2  - When alcohol is consumed during the prenatal period, it may result in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in the offspring. The aim of this study is to investigate neuroapoptosis on the cerebral cortex of rat pups caused by prenatal alcohol exposure with modified liquid diet and to illuminate the protective effects of betaine and folic acid supplementation. Being alcohol-induced apoptosis indicators on the cerebral cortex of rat pups, cytochrome c, caspase 3 and calpain levels were checked. Cytochrome c level in ethanol+folic acid group (p < 0.05), caspase 3 level in ethanol+betaine+folic acid group (p < 0.01), calpain level in both ethanol+folic acid (p < 0.01) and ethanol+betaine+folic acid groups (p < 0.01) were found to be significantly lower than ethanol group. Cerebral cortex tissues were examined histologically in terms of congestion, edema, necrosis and chromatolysis. While ethanol increased the number of apoptotic cells, it was decreased in ethanol+betaine (p < 0.05) and ethanol+betaine+folic acid groups (p < 0.05). Morphometric examination showed that while the diameter of apoptotic cells increased with ethanol administration (p < 0.01), they were lowered at ethanol+betaine (p < 0.001) and ethanol+betaine+folic acid groups (p < 0.001). As a result, we found that ethanol is capable of triggering cell death in the ethanol-administered rat pups and folic acid and betaine may reduce apoptosis either alone or together.

N2  - In this study, the aim was to investigate the prenatal alcoholinduced oxidative stress on rat cerebral cortex of newborn pups and assess the protective and beneficial effects of Boric acid (BA) supplementation on rats with Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Pregnant rats were divided into three groups as control group, alcohol group and alcohol + boric acid group. As markers of alcohol-induced oxidative stress in newborn pups' cerebral cortex, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were measured. Although MDA levels in alcohol-administered group was significantly increased compared to control group (p < 0.05), its level in the alcohol + boric acid group was shown to significantly decrease compared to alcohol group (p < 0.01). CAT activity of alcohol + boric acid group was found statistically higher than the alcohol group (p < 0.05). GPx activity in the alcohol group was decreased compared to control group (p < 0.05). As a result, we found that alcohol was capable of triggering damage to membranes on cerebral cortex of rat pups and BA could be influential on antioxidant mechanisms resulting from prenatal alcohol.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Aim There are alarming rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in the Kimberley region of Western Australia despite numerous international studies demonstrating the links between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and FASD. The aim of this research was to help determine factors that may be associated with correct knowledge about safe drinking practices during pregnancy, with these factors used to help inform future interventions. Method Ninety-nine residents (40 males, 59 females, 39% of which self-identified as Indigenous) from the Kimberley region (Broome and smaller remote communities) completed a survey examining knowledge of currently recommended safe drinking practices during pregnancy and knowledge of the outcomes for children with FASD over a period of approximately 2 months. Results The results revealed that education level (i.e. not completing high school through to completing university) is the biggest predictor (beta = 0.44, P < 0.01) of knowledge of safe drinking practices during pregnancy, and having heard of FASD (beta = 0.67, P < 0.001) was the biggest predictor of knowledge of outcomes for children with FASD. Other variables such as age, sex, Indigenous status and income level were not as important. Conclusions These findings suggest that early education regarding the consequences of alcohol consumption for women of childbearing age should be paramount in this or similar communities. Suggestions for targeted interventions are discussed in light of these findings. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption inflicts a multitude of phenotypic consequences that range from undetectable changes to severe dysmorphology. Using tightly controlled murine studies that deliver precise amounts of alcohol at discrete developmental stages, our group and other labs demonstrated in prior studies that the C57BL/6 and DBA/2 inbred mouse strains display differential susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of alcohol. Since the phenotypic diversity extends beyond the amount, dosage and timing of alcohol exposure, it is likely that an individual's genetic background contributes to the phenotypic spectrum. To identify the genomic signatures associated with these observed differences in alcohol-induced dysmorphology, we conducted a microarray-based transcriptome study that also interrogated the genomic signatures between these two lines based on genetic background and alcohol exposure. This approach is called a gene x environment (GxE) analysis; one example of a GxE interaction would be a gene whose expression level increases in C57BL/6, but decreases in DBA/2 embryos, following alcohol exposure. We identified 35 candidate genes exhibiting GxE interactions. To identify cis-acting factors that mediated these interactions, we interrogated the proximal promoters of these 35 candidates and found 241 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 16 promoters. Further investigation indicated that 186 SNVs (15 promoters) are predicted to alter transcription factor binding. In addition, 62 SNVs created, removed or altered the placement of a CpG dinucleotide in 13 of the proximal promoters, 53 of which overlapped putative transcription factor binding sites. These 53 SNVs are also our top candidates for future studies aimed at examining the effects of alcohol on epigenetic gene regulation. © 2014 Lossie, Muir, Lo, Timm, Liu, Gray and Zhou.

N2  - Background and aims: Alcohol drinking during pregnancy poses serious health risks to the unborn child such as prematurity, low or high birthweight, fetal death and fetal alcohol syndrome. However, the effects of maternal ethanol consumption before pregnancy on the abnormal development of fetus and the association with the impaired glucose tolerance of mother are not fully understood. Materials and methods: To this, the 6-week C57BL/6J female mice were fed with 5% ethanol-containing liquid diet for 2 weeks before pregnancy and examined the effects of ethanol pre-exposure on fetal development during a subsequent pregnancy. Results: Here, we found that pregnancy or fertility rates were decreased in ethanol-fed mice, correlated with the delaying of eye formation and the formation of defective toe. Also, birth weight in postnatal 0 day (P0) of ethanol- fed mice was higher than those of pair-fed mice, but thereafter, in P14 and P21, growth retardation appeared in the child of ethanol-fed mice. The macrosomia phenomenon in ethanol-fed mice is strongly associated with the dysregulation of glucose metabolism and triglyceride accumulation in maternal liver during the pregnancy. Gut-derived serotonin (GDS) as well as hepatic inflammatory chemokines and cytokines are also markedly increased in ethanol-fed mice, subsequently followed by the alteration of glucose metabolism in the liver and pancreatic beta-cells. Alcohol intake changed the expression of GDS-response receptors from Gs-GPCR to Gi or Gq-GPCR. The detrimental fetal development and impaired glucose metabolism by maternal pre-exposure to ethanol are strongly attenuated by the injection of 4-methylprazol, an inhibitor of CYP2E1. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that ethanol consumption before pregnancy is a major causing factor for the detrimental fetus development via maternal metabolic disorders, especially on the dysregulation of glucose or insulin metabolism in maternal liver and pancreatic beta-cells.

N2  - Background. Recent reports indicate a decline in rates of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) among Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) infants. Nevertheless, AN/AI infants remain disproportionately impacted by the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods. AN/AI pregnant women in their 3rd trimester completed a questionnaire on demographic data and the amount and frequency of their alcohol consumption in the month prior to conception and during pregnancy. Differences across demographics and trimesters were tested with the Chi-square, Fisher's exact or McNemar's test as appropriate. Results. Of the 125 participants, 56% (n=71) reported no alcohol consumption in the 1st through 3rd trimesters of pregnancy; 30% (n=38) of the 125 participants also reported no alcohol consumption in the month before pregnancy. Of the 43% (n=54) who reported consuming alcohol during pregnancy (1st, 2nd and/or 3rd trimester), most (35%) reported alcohol use only in the 1st trimester. Binge drinking in the 1st or 2nd trimester was reported amongst 20% (n=25) of participants with an additional 18% (n=29) reporting binge drinking in the month prior to pregnancy. Women who reported pre-conception binge drinking were significantly more likely to report binge drinking during their 1st trimester (p<0.0001) and 2nd trimester (p<0.0001). A history of tobacco use (p=0.0403) and cigarette smoking during pregnancy (p<0.0001) were also associated with binge drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion. Among study participants, reported use of alcohol was primarily limited to pre-conception and the 1st trimester, with a dramatic decrease in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Prevention programmes, such as the Alaska FAS Prevention Project, may have contributed to observed decreases in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Additional study and focus on pre-conception, the 1st trimester and binge drinking, as well as tobacco use might augment Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder prevention efforts. © 2013 Burhan A.

N2  - Objective. The Brightening Our Home Fires (BOHF) project was conceptualized as an exploratory project to examine the issue of the prevention of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) from a women's health perspective in the Northwest Territories (NT). While dominant discourse suggests that FASD is preventable by abstention from alcohol during pregnancy, a broader perspective would indicate that alcohol and pregnancy is a far more complex issue, that is, bound in location, economics, social and cultural views of health. This project was prevention focused and a social determinant of health (SDH) perspective informed this research. Methods. The BOHF project was a qualitative research project using a participatory action research framework to examine women's health and healing in the north. The methodology utilized was Photovoice. Women were provided training in digital photography and given cameras to use and keep. The primary research question utilized was: What does health and healing look like for you in your community? Women described their photos, individually or in groups around this central topic. This research was FASD informed, and women participants were aware this was an FASD prevention funded project whose approach focused on a broader context of health and lived experience. Results. This project drew 30 participants from: Yellowknife, Lutsel 'ke, Behchoko and Ulukhaktok. These four different communities across the NT represented Dene and Inuit culture. The qualitative data analysis offered themes of importance to women's health in the north including: land and tradition; housing; poverty; food; family; health, mental health and trauma, and travel. Photovoice provides a non-threatening way to engage in dialogue on complex health and social issues. © 2013 Dorothy Badry and Aileen Wight Felske.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a frequent cause of mental retardation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development defects induced by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unclear. We used normal and Hsf2-deficient mice and cell systems to uncover a pivotal role for heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) in radial neuronal migration defects in the cortex, a hallmark of fetal alcohol exposure. Upon fetal alcohol exposure, HSF2 is essential for the triggering of HSF1 activation, which is accompanied by distinctive post-translational modifications, and HSF2 steers the formation of atypical alcohol-specific HSF1-HSF2 heterocomplexes. This perturbs the in vivo binding of HSF2 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in genes that control neuronal migration in normal conditions, such as p35 or the MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins, such as Dclk1 and Dcx), and alters their expression. In the absence of HSF2, migration defects as well as alterations in gene expression are reduced. Thus, HSF2, as a sensor for alcohol stress in the fetal brain, acts as a mediator of the neuronal migration defects associated with FASD. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Impaired social development is a core deficit of FASD. Severe social impairments persist with age and have a negative impact on multiple aspects of functioning. This review critically evaluates the existing literature on social skill deficits and current interventions for social problems in the FASD population. We hypothesized that social problems manifest differently across stages of development and remain pronounced throughout the life course. Methods: Empirical and review studies were ascertained via a computer-based search of PubMeand Web of Science search engine. Searches included different combinations of a main set of keywords: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, Prenatal Alcohol Exposure, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, social skills, social cognition, intervention, treatment, adaptive behaviour and social behaviour. Archival searches from published review papers were also conducted. Results: Social development including social interactions, adaptive behaviours and social cognition are impaired throughout the lifespan in the FASD population. Neonates and infants show significantly impaired arousal states and atypical or delayed developmental behaviours, while older children experience marked difficulties with interpersonal interactions. In adolescence, social impairments often manifest in delinquent and defiant behaviours that continue into adulthood. By working with the affected individual and the caregiver, successful programs are able to address the unique developmental needs of the FASD population. Although progress is reported in several programs, interventions directly targeting social skills are scarce and none have addressed issues regarding the changing trajectory of social issues with time. Conclusions/ Discussion: Existing literature points to a distinct pattern of problematic social skills that contribute to later secondary disabilities. While early intervention is suggested to prevent compounding problems, the efficacy of current approaches is limited.

N2  - Objectives: The focus of this study is to measure the prevalence of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during pregnancy by meconium fatty-acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) analysis in a population-based setting. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) manifests a continuum of permanent birth defects and neurodevelopmental impairments that originate from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Previous literature found that of the Ugandan women who drank regularly prior to pregnancy, only 18.3% reported abstinence, whereas an astonishing 11.1% increased alcohol use, and 68.3% decreased consumption. Thus, the number of FASD cases in parts of the sub-Saharan Africa is growing, which is a cause for concern due to the socio-economic impact. Methods: Meconium samples were collected from 505 newborns between October-November 2013 at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Each meconium sample was accompanied with a questionnaire containing neonatal/maternal information. FAEEs are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol produced in the fetus are serves as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. FAEE meconium concentrations greater than 2.00 nmol/g are considered indicative of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during the last two trimesters of pregnancy. Samples were frozen and shipped to the Motherisk Laboratory for analysis. FAEEs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantified using deuterated internal standards. Results: Of the 505 samples, 68 have been analyzed by GC/MS to date, where 2 are inconclusive due to it being transitional with stool. The remaining 66 samples did not show heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Meconium FAEE analysis is currently ongoing at Motherisk Laboratory. Conclusions: The identification of specific populations in need of basic epidemiologic research on the prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure is urgently required in order to create awareness and reduce the devastation of FASD. This is the first population-wide study of an entire neonatal population examining fetal alcohol exposure conducted in Uganda.

N2  - The Western Cape of South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) globally. Reducing alcohol use during pregnancy is a pressing public health priority for this region, but insight into the experiences of women who drink during pregnancy is lacking. Convenience sampling in alcohol-serving venues was used to identify women who were currently pregnant (n=12) or recently post-partum (n=12) and reported drinking during the pregnancy period. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between April and August 2013. Interviews explored drinking narratives, with textual data analyzed for themes related to factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy. All but one woman reported her pregnancy as unplanned. The majority sustained or increased drinking after pregnancy recognition, with patterns typically including multiple days of binge drinking per week. Analysis of the textual data revealed five primary factors that contributed to drinking during pregnancy: 1) women used alcohol as a strategy to cope with stressors and negative emotions, including those associated with pregnancy; 2) women drank as a way to retain social connection, often during a difficult period of life transition; 3) social norms in women's peer groups supported drinking during pregnancy; 4) women lacked attachment to the pregnancy or were resistant to motherhood; and 5) women were driven physiologically by alcohol addiction. Our data suggest that alcohol-serving settings are important sites to identify and target women at risk of drinking during pregnancy. Intervention approaches to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy should include counseling and contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies, mental health and coping interventions targeting pregnant women, peer-based interventions to change norms around perinatal drinking, and treatment for alcohol dependence during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that innovative interventions that go beyond the boundaries of the health care system are urgently needed to address FASD in this region. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Brain imaging studies suggest that cortical thickness decreases during childhood and adolescence, in concert with underlying structural and synaptic changes required for cognitive maturation and regional specialization of function. Abnormalities of this protracted developmental process may provide key insights into the cognitive and behavioral deficits that emerge in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have demonstrated cortical thickness differences in children and adolescents who were prenatally exposed to alcohol, though all have been cross sectional, limiting conclusions about cortical development with age. In this study, we analyze serially collected T1-weighted MRI from 11 children with FASD and 21 controls, scanned twice each ~2 to 4 years apart. Mixed-models analysis of cortical thickness measurements revealed age-by-group interactions in cortical thinning, with FASD participants undergoing less developmental thinning than controls across many regions of the cortex, particularly in medial frontal and parietal areas. These results provide further longitudinal evidence in humans that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with altered patterns of brain development that persist during childhood and adolescence. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Reductions in brain volumes represent a neurobiological signature of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Less clear is how regional brain tissue reductions differ after normalizing for brain size differences linked with FASD and whether these profiles can predict the degree of prenatal exposure to alcohol. To examine associations of regional brain tissue excesses/deficits with degree of prenatal alcohol exposure and diagnosis with and without correction for overall brain volume, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) methods were applied to structural imaging data from a well-characterized, demographically homogeneous sample of children diagnosed with FASD (n = 39, 9.6-11.0 years) and controls (n = 16, 9.5-11.0 years). Degree of prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated with regionally pervasive brain tissue reductions in: (1) the thalamus, midbrain, and ventromedial frontal lobe, (2) the superior cerebellum and inferior occipital lobe, (3) the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and (4) the precuneus and superior parietal lobule. When overall brain size was factored out of the analysis on a subject-by-subject basis, no regions showed significant associations with alcohol exposure. FASD diagnosis was associated with a similar deformation pattern, but few of the regions survived FDR correction. In data-driven independent component analyses (ICA) regional brain tissue deformations successfully distinguished individuals based on extent of prenatal alcohol exposure and to a lesser degree, diagnosis. The greater sensitivity of the continuous measure of alcohol exposure compared with the categorical diagnosis across diverse brain regions underscores the dose dependence of these effects. The ICA results illustrate that profiles of brain tissue alterations may be a useful indicator of prenatal alcohol exposure when reliable historical data are not available and facial features are not apparent. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gross motor (GM) deficits are often reported in children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), but their prevalence and the domains affected are not clear. The objective of this review was to characterize GM impairment in children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or "moderate" to "heavy " maternal alcohol intake. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted. Medline, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, PEDro, and Google Scholar databases were searched. Published observational studies including children aged 0 to <18 years with (1) an FASD diagnosis or moderate to heavy PAE, or a mother with confirmed alcohol dependency or binge drinking during pregnancy, and (2) GM outcomes obtained by using a standardized assessment tool. Data were extracted regarding participants, exposure, diagnosis, and outcomes by using a standardized protocol. Methodological quality was evaluated by using Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. RESULTS: The search recovered 2881 articles of which 14 met the systematic review inclusion criteria. The subjects' mean age ranged from 3 days to 13 years. Study limitations included failure to report cutoffs for impairment, nonstandardized reporting of PAE, and small sample sizes. The meta-analysis pooled results (n = 10) revealed a significant association between a diagnosis of FASD or moderate to heavy PAE and GM impairment (odds ratio: 2.9; 95% confidence interval: 2.1-4.0). GM deficits were found in balance, coordination, and ball skills. There was insufficient data to determine prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The significant results suggest evaluation of GM proficiency should be a standard component of multidisciplinary FASD diagnostic services.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters expression of neurogenesis-related genes in an ex vivo cell culture model

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to long-lasting changes in functional and genetic programs of the brain, which may underlie behavioral alterations seen in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Aberrant fetal programming during gestational alcohol exposure is a possible mechanism by which alcohol imparts teratogenic effects on the brain; however, current methods used to investigate the effects of alcohol on development often rely on either direct application of alcohol in vitro or acute high doses in vivo. In this study, we used our established moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) model, resulting in maternal blood alcohol content of approximately 20 mM, and subsequent ex vivo cell culture to assess expression of genes related to neurogenesis. Proliferating and differentiating neural progenitor cell culture conditions were established from telencephalic tissue derived from embryonic day (E) 15-17 tissue exposed to alcohol via maternal drinking throughout pregnancy. Gene expression analysis on mRNA derived in vitro was performed using a microarray, and quantitative PCR was conducted for genes to validate the microarray. Student's t tests were performed for statistical comparison of each exposure under each culture condition using a 95% confidence interval. Eleven percent of genes on the array had significantly altered mRNA expression in the prenatal alcohol-exposed neural progenitor culture under proliferating conditions. These include reduced expression of Adora2a, Cxcl1, Dlg4, Hes1, Nptx1, and Vegfa and increased expression of Fgf13, Ndn, and Sox3; bioinformatics analysis indicated that these genes are involved in cell growth and proliferation. Decreased levels of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a were also found under proliferating conditions. Under differentiating conditions, 7.3% of genes had decreased mRNA expression; these include Cdk5rap3, Gdnf, Hey2, Heyl, Pard6b, and Ptn, which are associated with survival and differentiation as indicated by bioinformatics analysis. This study is the first to use chronic low to moderate PAE, to more accurately reflect maternal alcohol consumption, and subsequent neural progenitor cell culture to demonstrate that PAE throughout gestation alters expression of genes involved in neural development and embryonic neurogenesis. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background The teratogenic effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy include anomalies of craniofacial structures derived from the cranial neural crest cells. The presence of specific craniofacial anomalies contributes to the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Cleft lip and palate [orofacial clefts (OFCs)], also derived from the cranial neural crest cells, are common congenital anomalies, but their relationship with prenatal alcohol consumption is unknown. Methods To evaluate the association between maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy and the occurrence of OFCs in infants, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of published studies. We examined the associations between any alcohol consumption, binge level drinking, and heavy and moderate levels of consumption vs. no or low levels of consumption. Results After screening 737 publications, we identified 33 studies (23 case-control and 10 cohort studies). There was considerable heterogeneity in individual study design, quality measures and study results. Findings from random effects meta-analyses suggest no relationship between prenatal alcohol consumption and the occurrence of OFCs {pooled odds ratios for any alcohol intake and binge level drinking respectively: cleft lip with or without cleft palate 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86, 1.16] from 18 349 participants in 13 studies, 1.04 [95% CI 0.87, 1.24] [8763 individuals, 4 studies]; cleft palate only 1.05 [95% CI 0.92, 1.21] [21 459 individuals, 17 studies], 0.94 [95% CI 0.74, 1.21] [7730 participants, 4 studies]}. Conclusions While we found no association between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and OFCs in infants, the influence of study design, particularly in relation to alcohol exposure measurement and OFC ascertainment cannot be ignored. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Seizures are observed with a frequency of 3-21% in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, clinical, neuroradiologic, and electroencephalography (EEG) features are poorly described. In this study, 13 patients with FASD and epilepsy or seizures were identified retrospectively from the databases of seven Italian pediatric neurology divisions. Eleven children were affected by epilepsy, and two had at least one documented seizure. Both generalized and focal seizures were observed. EEG showed diffuse or focal epileptic activity; two children developed electric status epilepticus during sleep (ESES). Structural brain anomalies, including polymicrogyria, nodular heterotopia, atrophy, and Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, were discovered in almost 50% of patients. Control of seizures was not difficult to obtain in 11 cases; one patient showed pharmacoresistant epilepsy. EEG and clinical follow-up are recommended in children with FASD and epilepsy, since severe conditions requiring aggressive treatment, such as in ESES, may develop. Neuroradiological evaluation is warranted because several types of brain anomalies could be associated with maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a prenatal disease characterized by fetal morphological and neurological abnormalities originating from exposure to alcohol. Although FAS is a well-described pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying its progression are virtually unknown. Moreover, alcohol abuse can affect vitamin metabolism and absorption, although how alcohol impairs such biochemical pathways remains to be elucidated. We employed a variety of systems chemo-biology tools to understand the interplay between ethanol metabolism and vitamins during mouse neurodevelopment. For this purpose, we designed interactomes and employed transcriptomic data analysis approaches to study the neural tissue of Mus musculus exposed to ethanol prenatally and postnatally, simulating conditions that could lead to FAS development at different life stages. Our results showed that FAS can promote early changes in neurotransmitter release and glutamate equilibrium, as well as an abnormal calcium influx that can lead to neuroinflammation and impaired neurodifferentiation, both extensively connected with vitamin action and metabolism. Genes related to retinoic acid, niacin, vitamin D, and folate metabolism were underexpressed during neurodevelopment and appear to contribute to neuroinflammation progression and impaired synapsis. Our results also indicate that genes coding for tubulin, tubulin-associated proteins, synapse plasticity proteins, and proteins related to neurodifferentiation are extensively affected by ethanol exposure. Finally, we developed a molecular model of how ethanol can affect vitamin metabolism and impair neurodevelopment. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a wide range of deficits in executive function that persist throughout life, but little is known about how changes in brain structure relate to cognition in affected individuals. In the current study, we predicted that the rate of white matter volumetric development would be atypical in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) when compared to typically developing children, and that the rate of change in cognitive function would relate to differential white matter development between groups. Data were available for 103 subjects [49 with FASD, 54 controls, age range 6-17, mean age = 11.83] with 153 total observations. Groups were age-matched. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an executive function (EF) battery. Using white matter volumes measured bilaterally for frontal and parietal regions and the corpus callosum, change was predicted by modeling the effects of age, intracranial volume, sex, and interactions with exposure status and EF measures. While both groups showed regional increases in white matter volumes and improvement in cognitive performance over time, there were significant effects of exposure status on age-related relationships between white matter increases and EF measures. Specifically, individuals with FASD consistently showed a positive relationship between improved cognitive function and increased white matter volume over time, while no such relationships were seen in controls. These novel results relating improved cognitive function with increased white matter volume in FASD suggest that better cognitive outcomes could be possible for FASD subjects through interventions that enhance white matter plasticity. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Among the toxins contained in tobacco, nicotine and carbon monoxide are the ones with negative effects on the body of the embryo or the fetus. They pass in the developing body of the baby thanks to placental circulation and causes unwanted effects. Alcohol is a physical and behavioral teratogen which is one of the main causes of mental retardation in the world. Human fetal exposure to alcohol during its embryonic and/or fetal period leads to the birth of a child with fetal alcohol syndrome, which includes: pre-and/or postnatal retard of global growth, characteristic facial dysmorphia, associated malformations, neurologic impairment with microcephaly. Materials & Methods: The research included 205 pregnant women who were hospitalized in "Elena Doamna" Clinical Hospital of Obstetrics- Gynecology Iasi, over a period of time of 5 years (2009-2013). During the research the following have been met: the ethical collaboration with other physicians involved in the management of these cases, a non discriminatory attitude, without unprofessional judgments, the confidentiality of medical documents and personal data, except the statistical data included in the study. The questionnaire filled by the patients aimed the identify the presence of some teratogenic risk factors for the evolution of pregnancy and for the new-born. The share of women who voluntary exposed themselves to a toxic teratogen during pregnancy showed: exposure to nicotine - 25.4%, alcohol - 9.8% and professional toxic - 5.4%. The epidemiological study was a prospective one, case-control type. The data was processed with SPSS 13.0 statistical techniques. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: Age distribution of pregnant women in the study group, shows a higher frequency of pregnant women aged 20-29 (52.2%), those living in towns (78%), married (93.2%). According to the cases studied 55% of the pregnant smokers had premature labour, and the children born by smoking mothers had an APGAR score<7 (26.9%) and also their weight under 2700 g (46.2%). 95% of the children with mother who drank alcohol during pregnancy, had their weight at birth under 2700 g, and 30% of them had an APGAR score57. Premature labour was identified for 36.4% of the patients exposed to toxic emissions. 27.3% of the children whose mothers were exposed to professional toxic substances during pregnancy were under 2700 g at birth and 9.1% of them had an APGAR score57. Conclusions: Complications during pregnancy (hypertension, gestational diabetes, complications), were significantly more in smoking patients (p<0.05). The relative risk of premature birth was over two times higher for pregnant smokers (RR = 2.25). 25% of patients exposed to alcohol and all the patients exposed to occupational pollutants had complications in pregnancy.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Alcohol use during pregnancy is one of the leading preventable causes of intellectual or developmental disability. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is the non-diagnostic umbrella term used to characterize the full range of damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. This situation clearly warrants intervention. Development of a focused, effective and evidence based intervention requires insight in the burden of FASD and the underlying dynamics. The current literature synthesis aims to provide the required evidence base by compiling the literature on FASD, specifically addressing what we know of the prevalence of FASD, which behaviors contribute to FASD, and which preventive measures have been recommended so far. Materials & Methods: A search was conducted in multiple electronic bibliographic databases up to April 2014, including PubMed, PsychInfo, PsychArticles, ERIC, CINAHL and EMBASE. A query was generated and the resulting hits were exported and screened by two independent screeners. All hits marked for inclusion by at least one screener were acquired, after which a second screening was conducted based on the full texts. Resulting articles will be examined to determine whether meta-analysis is feasible or whether a systematic review will be conducted. All materials, data, and analysis scripts will be made available publicly. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: n/a Conclusions: Results of the systematic literature search will be presented and specific recommendations for prevention efforts will be discussed.

N2  - Introduction: The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is an ongoing international collaboration of clinical and basic science researchers focused on improving the diagnosis and treatment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To assess genetic susceptibility to FASD, we first tested hypotheses of neuroteratogenic effects of candidate genes. The role of these genes was then tested using quantitative measures obtained from3-D facial images and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the candidate genes. Methods: Several genes were nominated for initial gene 9 alcohol exposure analyses. Genes in the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) pathways were identified using genetic screens in a zebrafishmodel. The Src family kinases (SFK) were implicated in studies showing that phosphorylation of L1 is necessary for ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion and that levels of SFK phosphorylation of L1 predict the severity of ethanol teratogenesis in C57BL/6mice. Analyses were performed in a sample of 101 children aged 8-18 years (mean 12.3) having 3D facial images andDNA. Analyses were limited toSNPs within +/- 15 kb of genes in the PGDF pathway (PDGFRAPDGFRB, PDGFB, PDGFC, and PDGFD) and in the Src kinase family (FYN, YES1, L1CAM, SRC). Landmarksweremanually placed to induce a dense correspondence of tens of thousands of points on the surfaces of 3D images. Principal components based on these points were used as facial shape phenotypes in a linear model to test for a SNP 9 alcohol exposure interaction, accounting for effects due to sex and age. Results: Overall width/length of the face were associated with SNPs in FYN (best p=3.1 x 10-6). The facial shape depicting hypertelorism and mandibular retraction was associated with SNPs in the 30 region of YES1 (best p=5.4 x 10-4) and in L1CAM (best p=7.4 x 10-5). Other facial shapes were associated with SNPs in PDGFC (best p=1.2 x 10-5) and with SNPs in PDGFRB (best p=9.8 x 10-4). There was modest association of facial shapes with SNPs in PDGFRA and PDGFD (best p=2.9 x 10-3). Conclusion: Several SNPs in candidate genes were significantly associated with facial shape variables, providing evidence that ethanol interacts with SFK and PDGF genes to induce variation in craniofacial phenotypes in humans exposed prenatally to alcohol.

N2  - Introduction: The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is an ongoing international collaboration of clinical and basic science researchers focused on the development of effective interventions and treatment approaches for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Prenatal alcohol exposure causes facial dysmorphismincluding shortened palpebral fissures, mid-facial hypoplasia, flat nasal bridge, smooth philtrum, and thin upper vermillion. 3D facial photographs capturing 25,000+ surface points are used to visualise and detect facial dysmorphism using a mathematical representation of 3D face shape that is also conducive to investigating candidate susceptibility genes. Methods: A small number of manually placed facial landmarks was used to induce a dense correspondence of tens of thousands of points on the face surfaces of 3D photographs of a study cohort of 101 individuals aged 8 to 18 years (mean 12.3). Following an alignment process, the average position of each densely corresponded point on the face surfaces was calculated to produce the average face shape of the cohort. A principal component analysis (PCA) of position difference of the densely corresponded points on the faces of cohortmembers from their position on the average face produced a set of PCAmodes capturing position correlations of the surface points ordered (high-tolow) according to the degree of shape variance they describe. Results: The contiguously generated PCA modes whose total coverage of shape variance was at least 99%, forming what is known as a dense surface model, were retained to synthesize the face shape of individual subjects and average faces of subgroups containing individuals with confirmed degrees of prenatal alcohol exposure as well as individuals without such exposure. A dense surface model was similarly constructed for the philtrum area alone. Conclusion: The resulting dense surface models were used to visualise and detect the face and philtrum shape differences between the alcohol exposed/unexposed subgroups. For this particular study, the set of PCA modes in the dense surface models also offered a very compactmulti-dimensional representation of each individual's face and philtrum, using only tens of PCAmodes, that was conducive to analysis along with genetic and alcohol exposure data in investigations of candidate susceptibility genes.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in children. Approximately half of pregnancies are unplanned and targeting both alcohol use and contraception in child-bearing age women is important for preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP). Methods: A dual-focused (i.e., alcohol use and contraception) brief physician intervention (DFBPI) was designed based on the brief intervention guidelines (Babor et al., 2007) and two evidence-based FASD prevention interventions (Fleming et al., 2008; Floyd et al., 2009) modified to be deliverable by OB/GYN physicians. The intervention consisted of two face-to-face, structured, 5-minute sessions incorporated in routine clinic visits. The intervention was evaluated in a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial in 20 district OB/GYN (women's) clinics in two locations in Russia, including St. Petersburg, a major urban city in North-West and the Nizhny Novgorod Region, a more rural centrally located area. Clinics were randomized to intervention or control/services as usual conditions. A total of 1,536 women were screened and 766 non-pregnant women, aged 18-44 years, at risk for an AEP (at-risk drinking and heterosexually active and inconsistently using contraception) were recruited for the study with follow-up at 3, 6, and 12-months. Results: The AEP risk reduced in both conditions with a stable time effect of approximately 50% of women in the entire sample not at AEP risk (40%among women with AUDIT >8). Across the followup period, the odds ratios of being at reduced risk for AEP were 1.4 fold greater in the intervention group at 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.89). The growthmodelling indicated a clinic effect, heterogeneity of paths to change, and an effect of the initial alcohol consumption level. Additional analyses that utilize person-centered approaches (e.g., growth mixture modeling) are necessary to account for individual change paths and alcohol consumption levels to evaluate individual variations and patterns of alcohol use and AEP risk changes. Conclusions: Results support the feasibility of the DFBPI at OBGYN clinics in Russia. Relatively small efforts such as assessment that includes asking women questions about their alcohol use and pregnancy possibility, achieve reductions of AEP risk among at-risk drinking childbearing women.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure resulting in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is the most common cause of neurodevelopmental impairments in the western world, with an estimated prevalence of 2- 5%. It is well established from studies in human, and rodent and Xenopus models of FASD that a single acute exposure to alcohol during the earliest stage of gastrulation is sufficient to induce the developmental defects associated with FAS. Our Vitamin A Hypothesis proposes that ethanol competitively interacts with the enzymes that normally would process retinol (Vitamin A) to retinoic acid (RA); and moreover, the resultant reduction of RA levels at this critical developmental stage can explain the neurodevelopmental defects of FAS at the molecular level. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we genetically engineered mice to express Cyp26A1-eGFP from the endogenous Goosecoid (Gsc) promoter. Overexpression of Cyp26A1 canmimic the effects of acute alcohol exposure by depleting the availability of RA; and the Gsc promoter will target expression specifically to the organizer region during early gastrulation. We report here that we have successfully derived mice with germline transmission of the Gsc:Cyp26A1-eGFP allele. RT-PCR analysis of the frontal face-brain region of E15-E16 embryos mice confirm expression of Cyp26A1 and eGFP in heterozygous mice in vivo. Gsc:Cyp26A1 F1 mice are born with an expected normal mendelian ratio of het:wt (0.95, n=127). This data indicates that Gsc:Cyp26A1, a dominant acting allele, does not severely impact overall development or viability (at least 6 months). Newborn F1mice were phenotypically assessed (blinded) for cranial-facial defects characteristic of FASD features that are well established in alcohol- treated mouse models (narrow and less well defined philtrum, compressed nasal passage area and flatter upper lip, compared to normal or untreated pups). Pups were later genotyped at weaning. Our analysis shows 88%(15/17) of mutant mice assessed had a discernable FAS phenotype. 100% of wild-typemice had been assessed as normal (14/14). Taken together, the data strongly supports that disregulation of RA signaling during early gastrulation can induce FAS-like cranio-facial developmental defects. The model will allow a full analysis of themolecular etiology of FASD and the therapeutic feasibility of new treatments to prevent or reduce ethanol-induced FASD.

N2  - As part of an evaluation of the State of Hawaii's Perinatal Support program for at-risk mothers, we examined the impact of services on the reduction of alcohol use during pregnancy to inform prevention efforts of the Hawaii Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Task Force. This study focused on ethnically diverse population in Hawaii, with a significant Asian and Pacific Islander population. Secondary data analysis was performed on a sample of 7,186 women whomwere enrolled in the program fromJuly 2007 to June 2012. Sociodemographic information, alcohol use, and other related behavioral risk factors were assessed at intake and subsequent trimester follow-ups. The mean age for participants was 25.6 years (sd=6.3). Of the sample, 9.6%were Caucasian, 5.5%Hispanic, 1.2%African American, 8.4%Asian, 15.9%Filipino, 22%Pacific Islanders (Micronesian), 7.5%other Pacific Islanders, 28.8% Native Hawaiian, and 1.1%Other. Overall, 9.6% of women screened positive or endorsed alcohol use at intake (regardless of trimester). There were significant differences in rates of alcohol use in the first trimester by ethnicity, where African American (18.9%), Native Hawaiian (17.5%), Filipino (13.1%), Caucasian (12.9%), Other (11.6%), and other Pacific Islanders (11.1%) weremore likely to endorse alcohol compared to Asian (6%), Hispanic (4.4%), and Pacific Islanders (Micronesian; 2.8%) (chi2 [9, n=3,708] 99.165, p<0.0001). Of a subset of women who were assessed in both first and second trimesters (n=2,494), 10.7%showed a reduction in alcohol risk, 3.3%continued to endorse alcohol use in the second trimester, and 1.3%newly endorsed alcohol use in the second trimester. From women who were also assessed in third trimester (n=1,942), of those who dropped alcohol use during the second trimester, 82.4%continued abstinence of alcohol use. Of the women who endorsed alcohol during the first and second trimesters, 38% stopped during the third trimester. These findings highlight the importance of prevention intervention programs in the reduction of alcohol use during pregnancy. Variation in alcohol by ethnicity suggests that ethnocultural differencesmay also be important for improving screening and intervention approaches.

N2  - This randomized trial evaluated effects of FASD education brochures on knowledge, attitudes, and alcohol consumption among childbearing age women in two regions in Russia. A total of 458 women (101 were pregnant and 357 non-pregnant) were recruited from women's clinics and randomly assigned to receiving: (1) a FASD education brochure with positive images and information stated in a positive way, positive group (PG); or (2) a FASD education brochure with negatively presented information, negative group (NG); or (3) a general healthmaterial, control group (CG). Face-to-face structured interviews to assess women's alcohol consumption, knowledge about FASD, and attitudes were conducted at baseline and at a one-month follow-up. The interview utilized internationally-recognized measures and was pilot tested prior to implementation. NIH definitions of women's at-risk drinking were utilized. Quantile regression, McNemar's and Fisher's tests were performed. This presentation aimed at identification of effects of FASD education brochures on women's alcohol consumption. A high proportion of women in this sample were at-risk because of their binge drinking. The three groups/study conditions did not differ in proportions of at-risk drinkers at baseline. There was a significant decrease in alcohol consumption between baseline and one-month follow-up in all three study conditions. The effect was higher in both experimental conditions (PG and NG) compared to CG and in PG compared to NG. As indicated by risk ratio coefficients in all three study conditions, women who were at-risk drinkers at baseline were less likely to change their alcohol use and more likely to sustain at-risk alcohol consumption at follow-up. Participation in the study and answering questions about alcohol consumption had an intervention effect and led to a reduction of alcohol consumption in both experimental and control conditions. Receiving a FASD education brochure was associated with a higher reduction in the proportion of atrisk drinking women at follow-up compared to women who received a general health information brochure. The reduction was higher among women who received a brochure with positive images and positively stated information. The study indicated that providing FASD education brochures, particularly brochures with positively presented information, has a significant effect on alcohol use among women.

N2  - Following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), a complex pattern of impairments in cognition, self-regulation, and adaptive functioning are observed, which correspond with alterations in brain structure. However, little is known about how white matter connectivity among regions is altered by PAE. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique that allows for assessment of white matter tract integrity by measuring restriction of water diffusion, known as fractional anisotropy (FA). During development, both FA and myelination of tracts increase, and FA likely reflects in part the degree of myelination. Evidence from rodent and human studies suggests that myelination is reduced by PAE; however, little is known about how PAE alters whitemattermicrostructure along major tracts. DTI images were obtained in FASD and Control adolescents (n=48, 8-18 yrs, X=13+/-2 years,48% female) as part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD). Alongtract statistics were utilized to investigate integrity of white matter at specific points along 9 major tracts across boys and girls, controlling for multiple Point by Tract comparisons at p<0.05. Similar to previous findings, an overall decrease in whole brain FA was observed among adolescents with FASD compared to Control counterparts (p=0.014). This effect was driven largely by lower FA in the right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and right corticospinal tract (CST) (p's<0.0001) and a similar statistical trend for the left CST (p=0.004). An overall increase in number of streamlines comprising the tracts was observed between FASD compared to Control adolescents (p=0.003), and this effect was predominantly observed in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO) (p=0.001). These novel results identify specific points along white matter tracts that may be more vulnerable to the effects of PAE. The present findings have implications for understanding cognitive and behavioral alterations commonly observed among adolescents with a FASD that specifically implicate connections between the: 1) thalamus and prefrontal cortex (ATR), or 2) motor system and spinal tract (CST). Future research will investigate the sexually dimorphic effects of PAE on structural connectivity and associated cognitive deficits. These findings, which demonstrate specific alterations related to PAE, could potentially enhance future interventions.

N2  - Because prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with growth deficiency, very little attention has been paid to the potentially high prevalence of overweight and obesity in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) compared to the population as a whole. This study examined the prevalence of overweight/obesity in a large representative clinical sample of children and adolescents with FASD and sought to identify characteristics associated with increased risk for obesity in these individuals. Children, ages 2 to 19 years, who were evaluated for FASD at University Clinics included 446 participants with an FASD diagnosis and 171 participants with no-FASD diagnosis. The prevalence of overweight/obesity (BMI >85 percentile) was compared to national and state prevalence rates. BMI was examined in relation to FASD diagnosis, gender, age, and behavior regulation. Dietary intake data was also examined for a young sub-sample (n=42). Thirty-four percent of children and adolescents with any FASD diagnosis were overweight or obese, which did not differ fromthe prevalence among U.S. children or among the no-FASD group. However, high rates of overweight/obesity were seen in those with Partial FAS diagnoses (40%). In addition, adolescents (ages 13 to 19) with any FASD diagnosis had elevated rates (42%), particularly among females (50%). The rate of overweight/obesity in adolescent females with FASD was nearly three times higher than the state prevalence for adolescent females (17-18%), p<0.001. Poor behavioral regulation on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function and increased impulsivity on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test-II were correlated with higher BMI. In the young subsample, low effortful control on the Child Behavior Questionnaire was correlated with dietary fat intake, r=-0.33, p=0.033. Overweight and obesity are common in adolescents with FASD (particularly in females), in those with a Partial FAS diagnosis, and in those with poor behavior control. These data suggest that clinicians treating patients with FASD should consider dietary and other interventions for the highest-risk individuals.

N2  - This study seeks to determine the extent and duration of alcohol use that occurs while breastfeeding, and the effect that alcohol exposure via breast milk may have on the offspring. Maternal risk factor data were collected in theWestern Cape Province of South Africa from 1,294 mothers of first grade students in four, large, in-school study samples of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among first graders enrolled in 60 primary schools in five communities. The maternal subjects of the study are the mothers of children: 1) who were diagnosed with a specific diagnosis within the continuum of FASD, or 2) who were randomly-selected as candidates for a control/comparison group and their child was not diagnosed with an FASD or another known anomaly. Overall, 89.4% of all mothers in these communities breastfed these children for a mean duration of 19.8 months. Most mothers of children with an FASD breastfed (91.4%) for an average of 21.3 months as did 84.4%ofmothers of the controls for an average of 18.7 months; these differences were not statistically significantly different. Eighty-eight percent of the mothers of children with an FASD, 85.7%of the mothers of the prenatally- alcohol-exposed normal controls, and 29.4%of the mothers of prenatally unexposed controls reported drinking while breastfeeding. The mothers of children with an FASD who drank while breastfeeding had significantly higher reported drinking levels than the drinking mothers of the control children. Children with an FASD diagnosis who had also been exposed to alcohol via breastmilk had significantly more dysmorphology than those with FASD who were not exposed to alcohol in the breast milk (16.5 vs. 14.6, t=2.68, p=0.009). Among the controls, there is no significant difference in total dysmorphology based on alcohol exposure via breastmilk (8.4 vs. 7.8, t=0.78, p=0.438). Adjusting for maternal physical characteristics, demographics, pregnancy variables, and drinking during pregnancy (strong covariates of an FASD diagnosis), sequential logistic regression analysis indicated thatmothers who drank alcohol while breastfeeding were 6.5 times more likely to have a child with an FASD diagnosis than weremothers who did not drink during the breastfeeding period (B=1.863, p=0.011, OR=6.446).

N2  - This study will determine if there is a difference in maternal risk factors and the prevalence and severity of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) for mothers who live and work on farms versus those of mothers who work on farms but live in nearby towns in theWestern Cape Province (WCP) of South Africa (ZA). FASD occur when a foetus is exposed to substantial amounts of alcohol in the prenatal period, especially through maternal binge drinking. In five study communities of the WCP, the prevalence of FASD reportedmost recently is 13.5%to 20.8%, the highest prevalence documented anywhere in the world. Epidemiology studies in theWCP have found that farm workers generally have the poorest socio-economic circumstances, high fertility, poor nutrition, and the most regular and heavy patterns of binge drinking during pregnancy. Each of these factors increases the risk of bearing a child with an FASD, and not coincidentally, the highest rates of FASD have been found among farm workers. The majority of farm workers have traditionally been residents on farms where they work; however, recent residential trends are changing, and it is now more common for a higher proportion of farm workers to live in near-by towns. Although the living circumstances of many farm workers have increased notably during the past years, a substantial number of farm workers have lost their permanent jobs and homes on farms andmoved to towns. Some female farm workers may live in dire circumstances, for many are now seasonal workers with no job security or benefits, and access to alcohol may be greater for those living in the towns. Others who have moved to the towns may be forming new patterns of living and norms that will protect their offspring from alcohol exposure and therefore FASD-related disabilities. A collaborative research teamfromthe USA and ZA have researched the epidemiology of FASD over the past 16 years, and can now ask: how do these residence patterns influence maternal risk for, and rates of, FASD? The accumulated data sets for 6,767 children and 2,625 of their mothers will be analysed to compare differential patterns and factors of maternal risk (e.g. quantity, frequency, and timing of alcohol use, childbearing, and socioeconomic), specific indicators of child outcome (dysmorphology and cognitive/behavioural), and differential diagnoses of FASD for farm workers living in towns versus on farms.

N2  - This study was launched to determine the prevalence of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the characteristics and traits of children with FASD, normal controls, and their mothers in the general population of a rural area of the Western Cape Province (WCP) of South Africa (ZA). The epidemiology of FASD has been well studied and described in the extant literature for the more urban/small city, western portion of theWCP close to the Cape Town metropolitan area. In those previous studies of first grade children, extremely extremely high rates of FASD have been reported: fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) rates of 59 to 91 per 1,000, and total FASD rates of 13.5 to 20.7%. Also in previous studies, the prevalence of FASD was highest in the rural areas surrounding the small cities, as low socioeconomic status (SES), insufficient nutrition, high fertility, and norms supporting heavy binge drinking are common among a substantially higher portion of the rural, childbearing population. This new, in-school study of first grade children and their mothers was undertaken in four, previously unstudied, rural communities of theWCP that are substantially farther away andmore isolated from Cape Town. Geographically, socially and economically isolated, SES is lower in these rural, agricultural communities where alcohol consumption among men and women is believed to be more prevalent and severe than in most communities in ZA. There were 1870 first grade students enrolled, 1062 of whomentered the full study via: 1) height, weight and/or head circumference <25th centile, 2) random selection as candidates for controls (if they were not eventually diagnosed in the study as having an FASD or another anomaly), or 3) teacher referral. Following dysmorphology examination, cognitive/behavioral testing, and risk factor interview of the mothers, final Institute of Medicine diagnoses were made: FAS=173; PFAS=109; ARND=59; and ARBD=0. Detailed group comparisons of children with a specific diagnosis within the FASD continuum with controls (those prenatally exposed to alcohol and those not exposed) will be presented for physical dysmorphology and cognitive/behavioral traits. Alcohol use and other traits and behaviors of the maternal groups will also be described and linked to child diagnoses. The prevalence of FASD in these rural communities is very high: FAS occurs in 92.5 to 162.9 per 1,000 children and total FASD affects 18.2%to 32.1%.

N2  - Whereas children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS) exhibit distinctive facial dysmorphology, the term alcohol-related neurodevelopomental disorders (ARND) is applied to prenatally-exposed individuals who exhibit neurobehavioral deficits while lacking this dysmorphology. In an attempt to improve identification of ARND in a well-characterized Cape Coloured sample, Suttie et al. (2013) applied a dense surfacemodel approach to 3D photographs, in which sparse landmarks induced a correspondence of thousands of points to capture subtle shape differences. For themore heterogeneous heavily exposed (HE) nondysmorphic phenotype, a novel clustering technique, shape signature graph analysis, was used, which involved normalizing face shape with respect to a control group and connecting individuals with themost similar facial dysmorphism. Signature graph analysis identified about half of the nonsyndromal HE group as having facial dysmorphism similar to the children with FAS and PFAS compared to healthy controls (the "HE1 group"), whereas the others were more similar to the controls ("HE2"). 161 children (17 FAS, 23 PFAS, 59 HE nonsyndromal, 62 controls) from this Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort were assessed on theWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (4th Ed; WISC-IV) and the California Verbal Learning Task (CVLT) at 9 years. Their mothers had been interviewed during pregnancy to determine their alcohol consumption using a timeline follow-back interview. The children were examined at 5 years by three expert dysmorphologists for fetal alcohol-related anomalies and growth impairment. WISC IQ was related to diagnostic group in a dose-dependent fashion. On theWISC-IV Verbal Comprehension Index and the CVLT, the scores in the HE1 group were similar to those in the FAS and PFAS groups, whereas the HE2 group's performance resembled that of the controls. The HE1 and HE2 groups did not differ, however, on the three otherWISC-IV indices-Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed, or on alcohol-related eyeblink conditioning. These data suggest that the subtle facial dysmorphology differences revealed by the Suttie et al. dense surface analysis are related specifically to deficits in the verbal domain, possibly due to effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on underlying frontal lobe structure and function that may mediate effects on verbal performance.

N2  - Purpose of study: Neurobehavioral problems may manifest differently over a range of ages in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We previously found that school teachers in a South African region reported significant behavior problems in learners with FASD aged 6 and 10 years compared to typically developing controls. This study aimed to examine the behavioral profile of an older (adolescent) age-band of prenatally alcohol-exposed children in the same regional setting. Methods: Participants were children with prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) (n=56) and no or minimal alcohol exposure (CON) (n=62). Participants were recruited from a previous epidemiological study in this high risk community in the Western Cape Province. As part of a multisite CIFASD study, children's teachers completed the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) teacher report form (TRF), rating behavior Symptom Scales including: anxiety/depression (ANX/DEP), social problem (SOC), internalizing (INT) and obsessive compulsive (OCD) symptoms and DSM-oriented conditions: affect (AFF), anxiety (ANX), somatic (SOM), inattention (INATT), hyperactivity/ impulsivity (HYPER-IMP), ADHD, oppositional defiant (OD) and conduct problems (CD). Mean age at TRF assessment was 14.9 yr (S.D=0.64). Data were analyzed using ANOVA and dependent outcomes were covaried for age, sex and IQ. The relationship between maternal drinking in pregnancy and TRF scores was measured with Spearman correlations. Results: Teachers rated the ALC group as having significantly more problems in most TRF domains. After covariant analysis, there remained significant effects of group on ANX/DEP, SOC and INT symptoms and INATT, AFFECT, ANX and OCD DSM-oriented conditions. Bivariate correlations were significant between maternal alcohol consumption (first trimester drinks per day and occurrence of binge drinking) and higher ratings of problem behaviors. Conclusion: A range of significant problem behaviors in South African children with prenatal alcohol exposure persist into adolescence. Not all behaviorally affected alcohol-exposed children meet clinical diagnostic criteria for FASD. These findings have implications for early recognition of children at risk and development of relevant educational and classroom behavior support strategies.

N2  - The goal of this study is to develop diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) that can be used in infancy and very early childhood. FASD occur when fetuses are exposed to alcohol in the prenatal period via maternal drinking, usually through heavy, binge drinking. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most clinically recognizable formof FASD and is characterized by a pattern of minor facial anomalies, prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, and functional or structural central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. However, diagnosis of FAS in the infancy and early-childhood period is difficult and no clear criteria have been established for an early childhood diagnosis. The highest documented population prevalence of FAS in the world is 80 per 1,000 in themixed race population of theWestern Cape Province in South Africa. The consequences of FASD are lifelong, thus, early diagnosis and referral for early intervention services are imperative. However, while application of diagnostic guidelines for FASD in older children and adolescents can be difficult, diagnosis in the infant is rarely attempted because of the lack of documented specificity of the phenotype in the newborn. Yet, identification and referral within the first few months of lifemay represent the most crucial time in the affected child's life for initiation of early intervention services. A collaborative team of researchers from Stellenbosch University, The University of North Carolina, Sanford Research and The University of New Mexico have been following children from the newborn period to 60 months of age to determine the dysmorphology and developmental trajectories that characterize the alcoholexposed population in this stage of life (N=140). We are using three methodologies to approach this issue: growth and standardized dysmorphology assessment of subjects and controls at birth, 6 weeks, and 9 18, 42 and 60 months respectively; standardized developmental assessments (using age appropriate assessment tools) at the same intervals; and digital photography at each interval. This poster will present the results of our study of the children up to 18 months of age. The results consistently show slower developmental progress among alcohol-exposed children and variable dysmorphology over the time increments. Examination of the cohort continues at the above regular time intervals until the children reach the age of 60 months.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt development, leading to physical, neuropathological, and cognitive disorders. In a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), these effects can be reduced by treatment with choline, a precursor in the one-carbon metabolic cycle that generates s-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). DNA methyltransferases require SAMas a methyl donor for de novo cytosine methylation, and choline supplementation alters local and global DNA cytosine methylation patterns. To better understand cellular responses to ethanol in the developing nervous system, and how these responses might be mitigated by choline, rat prefrontal cortices were studied. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups in a 2 (EtOH, sham) x 2 (choline chloride, vehicle) design. Alcohol (5.25 g/kg/day) was administered by intragastric intubation at postnatal days (PD) 4-9; choline (100 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection at PD 4-30. Tissue was collected on PD 31. The early (PD 4-9) postnatal development of the rat brain models the third trimester of human fetal brain development. Methylated DNA from prefrontal cortex tissue was captured by a methyl binding protein approach (ActiveMotif Methyl Collector Ultra). Greater than 200 million DNA fragments were sequenced for each group and methylome features analyzed using the CLC Bio Genome Workbench (version 6.5b3). Results: Comparing global DNA methylation patterns by scatter, Q-Q, volcano plots, antibodybased fluorescent assays, and LINE-1 pyrosequencing, we observed high correlation between treatment groups. However, when we queried genomic regions 10 kilobases upstream and downstream of the transcriptome transcription start site, we identified hypermethylated and hypomethylated loci in the different treatment groups. Using a modified gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to group changes in genic DNA methylation into molecular pathways, we detected alcohol-induced and choline-modified DNAmethylation changes at genes involved in acetylcholine signaling, retinoidmetabolism, and others. Discussion: This genomic view of brain methylome in the developing rat exposed to alcohol and choline suggests an important role for retinoid signaling in FASD, and also implicates several other gene networks. These data identify genetic targets through which prenatal alcohol might alter development, as well as choline's modification of gene expression.

N2  - Insult to the CNS is accompanied by a graded response in which glia become activated. The molecular and phenotypic changes in activated microglia are increasingly understood and can now be applied to better understand the consequences of alcohol consumption. Maternal consumption of alcohol can lead to widespread neuropathology in the developing fetal brain. Using the neonatal mousemodel of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), characterized by significant neuronal loss and long term behavioral deficits, we previously demonstrated that microglia are highly vulnerable targets of ethanol pathogenesis in the developing brain. Specifically, ethanol exposure causes loss of microglial cells and the surviving microglia express morphological changes suggestive of microglial activation and neuroinflammation. In addition, we demonstrated that neuroprotective and antiinflammatory pharmaceutical PPAR-c agonists can block ethanol pathogenesis in both neurons and microglia. The present study analyzed cytokine and chemokine expression in this model to determine both the graded stage and molecular consequences of ethanol-induced microglial activation in the developing brain. Further, we determined whether treatment with the PPAR-c agonist pioglitazone would prevent ethanol-induced pathogenic changes in gene expression. Mice were treated with 4 g/kg ethanol by gavage on postnatal days (PD) 4-9. Animals received either water or pioglitazone by gavage on PD3-9. On PD10, animals were perfused to remove blood from the brain vasculature and the brain was microdissected. Analysis of gene expression revealed that ethanol induced expression of IL-1beta, TNF-a, and CCL2 (MCP-1) mRNA in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Treatment with pioglitazone completely prevented the ethanol-induced increase in cytokine and chemokine expression. These findings shed light on an important new potential mechanism underlying the neuropathology of FASD. First, expression of these specific cytokines and chemokines indicates that ethanol exposure in the developing brain produces a stage of microglial activation associated with major CNS insult and neurodegeneration. Second, these molecules are pro-inflammatory, as well as neurotoxic and gliotoxic, and thus likely contribute to the neuropathology of FASD. Finally, the FDA-approved pharmaceutical agent pioglitazone holds promise to intervene in the neuropathological consequences of FASD.

N2  - Lifelong social behavior deficits can serve as a unifying feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Social behavior deficits following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) becomemore pronounced prior to and during adolescence, a critical period of social behavior development. PAE is known to reprogram the stress systemsuch that PAE offspring are hyper-responsive to stressors, and exhibit increased drive and deficits in feedback. The functional relationship between the stress system and brain areas important for regulating social behavior suggests that alterations to the stress system are a source of observed PAE-related social behavior deficits. We investigated social behavior using a test of social learning in PAE and control rats. Pregnant rat dams were assigned to: 1) PAE: access to liquid ethanol diet ad libitum; 2) Pair-Fed: access to liquid control diet yoked to consumption of a PAE partner; or 3) Control: access to control diet ad libitum. Periadolescent offspring (~P30) were evaluated using a social recognition test. The learning phase of the test involves four 2-min sessions (18-min intertrial interval) during which the same social stimulus is introduced into the testing apparatus. A fifth, 2-min session with a novel social stimulus serves as the test phase. Time spent in investigation and specific social behaviors were recorded. Blood was collected for analysis of the stress hormone corticosterone and corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG). Preliminary data indicate PAE males show impairments in social recognition. Animals habituated to the familiar social stimulus, as measured by decreases in latency to initiate play over the learning phase. PAE males showed no change in latency to initiate play with the novel social stimulus, whereas control males showed a significant increase in play latency. PAE animals also showed divergent patterns of play behavior. These results demonstrate that PAE alters social recognition memory in early adolescence andmodifies normal social behavior. Additionally, we found no difference in levels of corticosterone, though increased levels of CBG were observed in PAE and Pair-Fed animals, indicating less free corticosterone in these animals and altered HPA activity. Changes in the stress system may underlie some of the social behavior deficits observed in PAE animals.

N2  - Recent experiments in our laboratory indicate that moderate fetal ethanol exposure(FAE) results in reductions in measures of dendritic morphology in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. The current experiments were undertaken to further establish a link between FAE, structure and function in the NAc, and voluntary alcohol consumption in adulthood. Moderate FAE was achieved using a two-bottle choice voluntary consumption paradigm. Dams received either 0 or 5%ethanol in saccharin throughout gestation, resulting in blood ethanol concentrations around 82 mg/dL. At sixmonths of age, male offspring were individually housed and given 4-hour access to two bottles containing either 20%ethanol or tap water. Immediately following ethanol consumption, rats were sacrificed and NActissue was processed for either immediate-early gene expression or Golgi-Cox staining. Using RT-PCR, the expression ofc-fos, Arc, and Homer1a were measured. No significant effects were found for Arc or c-fos expression in either the NAc core or shell between FAE and saccharinexposed control rats. There was a significant reduction in Homer1a expression in the NAc core, but not the shellof FAE rats. It was also found that NAc core Arc expression was negatively correlated with ethanol consumption in saccharin controls, but not in FAE animals.Measures of dendritic morphology found significant reductions in the core and shell for dendritic branching and length, as well as reduced spine density, in FAE rats. Reductions in the shell for all animals and in the core for FAE rats predicted ethanol consumption, with reduced dendritic branching associated with increased ethanol consumption. Two further experiments found no significant differences between FAE and control rats for ethanol metabolismor general reward learning using an operant intracranial selfstimulation paradigm. These results suggest that alcohol consumption by adult rats exposed tomoderate levels of ethanol in utero may lead to structural and functional alterations in the NAc core, and that these changes, combined with pre-existing deficits in the NAc shell,may partially explain the deficits in reward-guided learning and behavior in these animals.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can result in enduring severe cognitive deficits and characteristic facial features. A growing body of literature suggests that even moderate PAE can result in long lasting cognitive deficits exemplified in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, including impairments in learning and memory, social behavior and executive function. Executive function describes a broad range of cortically mediated behaviors including behavioral flexibility, which has been shown to be a sensitive and reliablemeasure across species. High dose of PAE has been shown to impair flexible behavior, but the effects of moderate PAE on this cognitive process have not been examined. Further, themechanisms that underlie the executive function deficits associated with FASD are still unclear. In order to investigate the effects of moderate PAE on executive control, we utilized a voluntary drinking paradigm where dams had access to a saccharine sweetened 10%alcohol solution for 4 hours, during the dark cycle, throughout gestation. Pups of alcohol and saccharine only (SAC) exposed dams were then tested on a visual pair-wise discrimination reversal touch-screen operant task during adulthood. PAE animals were not impaired in discriminative learning, butmade significantly more perseverative errors during choice shifting in the early phase of reversal (<20% correct). Further analysis of perseverative errors during early reversal revealed differences in the length of time spent in the perseverative phase between PAE and SAC mice. Across species reversal learning is mediated by orbital frontal cortex (OFC), therefore, we performed in vivo electrophysiology in the OFC of PAE and SACmice to examine whether alterations in cortical firing may underlie the behavioral deficit. Results showed a difference in phasic firing in the OFC of PAE animals specifically during early reversal, when choice shifting is occurring. Given the well-established role of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in synaptic plasticity and previous work showing alterations ofNMDAR subunits in the hippocampus after PAE, we are currently investigating if alterations in NMDA receptor function and expression are possiblemechanisms behind the alteration in cortical firing. Together our data demonstrate a long lasting impairment in executive function after moderate PAE that may result from alterations in cortical firing.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol SpectrumDisorders (FASD) are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) and believed responsible for the majority of developmental disabilities in the U.S. Our objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral for Treatment (SBIRT) interventionmay reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) women in Southern California. Southern California AI/AN women of childbearing age completed a survey including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use, were randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former completed an on-line SBIRT intervention, and were followed-up at 1, 3, and 6 months post-intervention. of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, a third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior and risk of AEP in the followup period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Factors associated with decreased risk included the baseline perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per week, a greater number of binge episodes in the past two weeks, and depression. Participation in this study may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the web-based intervention. The importance of perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/ functionality have implications for future interventions.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a broad term used to describe individuals exposed prenatally to alcohol and encompasses a broad range of birth defects including facial abnormalities and learning,motor, and behavioral deficits. Despite promoting alcohol abstinence during pregnancy, the incidenceof FASD has failed to declineand individuals lackingcardinal facial abnormalities and historical exposure are increasingly difficult to identify. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is readily available, provides superior brain contrast, and in previous human studies of FASD hasshownsignificant volume reductions in various brain structures.We hypothesize that postnatal MRI derived volumetric brain measurements can predict prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant ewes received 2.5 g/kg alcohol (N=8) IV three consecutive days per week fromgestation day 4-41 (mimicking a binge drinking pattern in the first trimester of pregnancy) while remaining ewes were controls (N=7). Lambs were sacrificed at 6 months of age, their brains were perfused with fixative, and MRI's were performed immediately post mortem.T1-weighted images were used to calculate cerebellar and pituitary volume(ITK-SNAP software, Version 2.4.0). Corrected mean cerebellar volume to total brain weight in controls(10.03+/-0.2328 g) was significantly different from the alcohol group (9.27+/-0.1305 g) (p<0.05) while corrected mean pituitary volume to total brain weight in controls (207.44+/-26.25 g) did not differ significantly from the alcohol group (180.63+/-8.106 g) (p=0.3175). TheseMRI findings differ fromour previous workutilizing stereological methods on the fetal cerebellumand the same first trimester alcohol exposure. The total estimated cerebellar Purkinje cell number andPurkinje cell density decreased significantlyin the alcohol group compared to thecontrol group but no significant differences existed between cerebellar volumes. Findings in the pituitary are consistent with previous rodent literature in which no significant volume differences were identified. Pituitary volume is therefore a poor predictor of first trimester alcohol exposureat this alcohol dose and pattern in sheep, but MRI derived volumetric measures of the cerebellum or other brain structures may be beneficial and further studies are warranted.

N2  - Early detection of alcohol use among pregnant women is critical to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Maternal self-reporting is largely unreliable and the utility of current biomarkers is also limited during pregnancy. Based on alcohol's complex effects on the transferrin N-glycans including loss of sialic acids, partial loss of sugars, and/or complete loss of oligosaccharide chains, we herein utilized state of the art mass spectrometry to characterize the sequences and abundances of maternal plasma transferrin N-linked oligosaccharides preserving the location of the N-glycosite in a pregnant rat binge alcohol paradigm model. We utilized a once-daily binge alcohol exposure paradigm (4 or 6 g/kg ethanol, intragastric gavage) for two weeks till gestational day 20. Blood sample (200 ll) was drawn into a heparinized vial at peak blood alcohol concentration time, plasma separated and utilized formass spectrometric studies. Protein identification and sequence mapping was followed by glycopeptide identification using the diagnostic fragmentation spectra. Absolute glycopeptide quantitation was performed. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed the composition, sequences, and abundances of rat maternal plasma transferrin N-linked oligosaccharides preserving the location of the N-glycosite. The abundances of several N-linked oligosaccharides were dosedependently altered with knock out of some moieties at the higher alcohol dose. These studies may pave way for developing highly sensitive protein post-translational modification signature profile directly relating to the dose and duration of exposure. We believe that these novelmethodologies can be in the future extended to pregnant women and form the basis for a high throughput screening tool that will help establish a standardized diagnostic criteria with a real clinical impact not only in diagnosis but also in treatment and prevention.

N2  - This study is a collaboration between theMotherisk Program and the University of British Columbia School of Population and Public Health, which collected meconium samples in Uganda to measure the prevalence of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during pregnancy. The focus of our study is to measure the frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure by meconium fatty-acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) analysis. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) describes a range of lifelong neurodevelopment impairments originating frommaternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Recent studies determined that of the Ugandan women who drank regularly prior to pregnancy, 18.3%reported abstinence, 68.3% decreased alcohol consumption, whereas an astonishing 11.1%reported increases in alcohol consumption. The number of FASD cases in parts of sub-Saharan Africa has been increasing, which is a cause for concern due to the socio-economic impact. The increase in FASD cases may be linked to the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy (2.2%-87%). FAEEs have served as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. Meconiumwas collected from 505 newborns between October-November 2013 atMbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Each meconium sample was attached to a questionnaire, which contained maternal and neonatal information. The questionnaires will serve as the maternal self-report for alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The criterion used to describe a positivemeconium FAEE test, which confirms excessive alcohol consumption during 2nd and/or 3rd trimester, are when the total FAEE concentration (sum of ethyl palmitate, oleate, stearate and linoleate concentrations) is greater than 2 nmol/g. All samples are analyzed by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction followed by GC/MS analyses. Meconium FAEE analysis is currently ongoing at Motherisk Laboratory. The identification of specific populations (i.e. Uganda) in need of basic epidemiologic research on the prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure is urgently required in order to create awareness and reduce the devastation of FASD.

N2  - While direct ethanol metabolites including ethyl glucuronide (EtG) play an important role for the confirmation of ethanol consumption, their utility is often limited by their short half-lives in blood and urine. Maternal hair might allow for a retrospectivemeasure of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) for up to severalmonths. Prior studies yieldedmixed results with respect to the utility of hair EtG (hEtG) in pregnant women. This study examined the validity of hEtG relative to self-reporting and five other biomarkers (gamma glutamyltranspeptidase [GGT], carbohydrate-deficient transferrin [CDT], urine ethyl glucuronide [uEtG], urine ethyl sulfate [uEtS], and phosphatidylethanol [PEth]) in 103 pregnant women. Patients were recruited from a UNM prenatal clinic and followed until the early postpartum period. The composite index, which was based on self-reported measures of alcohol use and allowed us to classify subjects into PAE (n=47) and control (n=56) groups, was the criterion measure used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of hEtG and other biomarkers. Proximal segments of hair were collected at enrollment (average 21.0 gestational weeks) and sent to a contract laboratory for analysis by LCMS/ MS. At the same visit,maternal specimens were collected for analysis of GGT and%dCDTin serum, urine EtG and EtS (uEtG, uEtS), and whole blood PEth. The pregnant population included a large proportion of ethnic minorities (76.7%Latina, 9.7% Native American, 3.9%African American) who were socially disadvantaged (51.5%< high school education; 99% Medicaid/no health insurance). Themeanmaternal age at recruitment was 26.6+/-5.1 years. Hair EtG demonstrated a 19.2%sensitivity and 87.5%specificity. The sensitivities of other biomarkers were comparable (6.7-20.0%) to hEtG in this cohort, but specificities were higher (98.2-100%). Of the five subjects positive for three or more biomarkers at enrollment, only two had hEtG levels greater than the limit of detection, and those concentrations were low (8 and 13 pg/mg). Mothers of two children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome had hEtG levels of 158 and 58 pg/mg. Combining hEtG with other biomarkers resulted in a substantial increase in the sensitivity to 44.7%with a slight decrease in specificity to 80.4%.These data suggest that given its lower specificity compared with other ethanol biomarkers, hEtG should not be used as a sole biomarker for identification of prenatal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol SpectrumDisorder (FASD) is an umbrella term used to describe the range of disabilities and diagnoses that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure. While alcohol teratogenesis generally results in diffuse brain alterations, the functional patterns of disability that result seem to vary patient to patient. To our knowledge, no actual data exists from more than specific research studies or single clinical programs that note the frequency of each co-occurring functional disorder nor identifies the common clusters of functional disorders. Similarly, diagnostic clinics may makemany treatment recommendations at the end of the FASD assessment process for health, mental health, social services, education, and others, but there has not been any published work that informs the ability to make meaningful interpretations of the diagnoses and disorders, as well as tomake recommendations for the most effective interventions. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop a database that would enable the collection of FASD diagnostic data across Canada in order to analyze and clearly document the common problems-and recommended treatments-associated with FASD. Importantly, the universal data form project provides a platform for standardized data collection. Methods: The data form was developed using a set of common forms and data was collected from over 30 participating FASD diagnostic teams in Canada. To date, the FASDataform Project has captured over 350 client records and initial data analysis reveals interesting patterns of functional diagnoses. The top three functional deficits were in the areas of adaptive behaviour (83%), executive function and abstract reasoning (81%), and social Communication (78%). The most frequent patterns of functional deficits were 'academic achievement, executive function, communication' (58%) and 'cognition, Executive function and Adaptive behaviour' (58%). Variations among provincial experiences and atypical functional clusters will also be discussed. Conclusion: This is the first clinical dataset for FASD that has provided identification of trends and modalities related to prevention, prevalence and diagnosis of FASD across jurisdictional lines. This data accurately reflects the pan-Canadian FASD diagnostic clinical experience. These data can be used for reporting, research and surveillance; as well as informing best practices and policy.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancymay lead to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Although models of IUGR exhibit altered uterine vascular adaptations, nothing is known about the effects of alcohol on uterine artery reactivity. We herein hypothesized that chronic binge-alcohol exposure during pregnancy impairs uterine vascular adaptations via the nitric oxide (NO) vasodilatory system. A chronic once daily binge alcohol paradigm was followed in the rats (6 g/kg; intragastric gavage; gestation day (GD) 5-19). Experiments were conducted on GD 20. A significant reduction in fetal whole body weight and crown-rump length was observed following alcohol exposure. Alcohol did not alter uterine artery contractility in response to a1 adrenergic agonist phenylephrine and thromboxane or vasodilatory response to endothelium-independent sodium-nitroprusside. Alcohol selectively impaired endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-induced uterine vascular relaxation (EMax, Ctrl, 94.7+/-1.6; Alc, 69.7+/-1.7; p<0.001). Alcohol-induced Ach-mediated impaired vasorelaxation was due to NO pathway because addition of inhibitors of prostacyclin and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor activity demonstrated a significant NO component (EMax, Ctrl, 65.8+/-2.4; Alc, 47.3+/-1.4; p<0.001). Addition of NO-related inhibitors (L-NAME and ODQ) validated the effects of alcohol on uterine NO system. Alcohol decreased the levels of amajor endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) excitatory site Pser1177eNOS (p<0.05) compared to the normal and pair-fed Ctrls, whereas alcohol significantly increased the levels of a major eNOS inhibitory site Pthr495eNOS (p<0.001). Total eNOS was significantly decreased in the alcohol group compared to the normal and pair-fed Ctrls (p<0.001). These data show that chronic binge alcohol impairs uterine vascular adaptations during pregnancy. Alcohol specifically impairs endothelium-dependent NO-mediated vasodilation via its effects on specific excitatory and inhibitory eNOS multi-site phosphorylation sites. These data underscore the importance ofmaternal uterine vascular adaptations in the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a multitude of neurological problems in offspring, varying from subtle behavioral changes to severe mental retardation. These alterations are collectively referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Early alcohol exposure can strongly affect the visual system and children with FASD can exhibit an amblyopia-like pattern of vision acuity defects even in the absence of optical and oculomotor disruptions. Here we test whether early alcohol exposure can lead to a disruption in visual acuity, using a mousemodel of FASD to mimic alcohol consumption in the last months of human gestation. To accomplish this, mice were exposed to ethanol (5 g/kg i.p.) or saline on postnatal days (P) 5, 7 and 9. Two to three weeks later, we recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to assess spatial frequency detection and contrast sensitivity, conducted electroretinography (ERG) to further assess visual function, and imaged retinotopy using optical imaging of intrinsic signals.We observed that animals exposed to ethanol displayed spatial frequency acuity curves similar to controls. However, ethanol treated animals showed a significant deficit in contrast sensitivity. Moreover, ERGs revealed a marked decrease in both a-and b-wave amplitudes, and optical imaging suggested that the elevationmaps of the primary visual cortex in ethanol treated animals have a 20-30degree difference in map tilt compared to saline controls. Overall, our findings suggest that binge alcohol drinking restricted to the lastmonths of gestation can lead to marked deficits in visual function.

N2  - Ethanol causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders partly by inhibiting adhesion mediated by the L1 neural cell adhesion molecule.We showed previously that L1 sensitivity to ethanol requires phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 substrate S1248 on the L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1-CD). Here we show that L1 sensitivity to ethanol also requires phosphorylation of Y1176 in the L1-CD by Src family kinase (SFK). Inhibition of phosphorylation using the SFK inhibitors PP2 or AZD0530 did not inhibit L1 adhesion but abolished ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion. Replacement of L1-Y1176 with leucine, which cannot be phosphorylated, also abolished ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion without altering L1 adhesion in the absence of ethanol.We used antibody 74-5H7, which recognizes only the dephosphorylated state of L1-Y1176 to show that clonal, ethanol-sensitive L1-expressing NIH/3T3 cells have higher levels of Y1176 phosphorylation than ethanol-insensitive cells. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of L1-Y1176, like phosphorylation of L1-S1248, is necessary for ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion, and differences in phosphorylation of Y1176 might also account for differences in sensitivity to ethanol among different cells. To learn whether differential phosphorylation of L1-Y1176 is associated with differential sensitivity to ethanol teratogenesis, wemeasured L1-1176 phosphorylation in embryonic day-10 embryos from C57BL/6 J and C57BL/6 N mice. Prvious studies have shown that prenatal ethanol exposure causes a higher incidence of ocular defects in C57BL/6 J mice than in C57BL/6 N mice, in this study we found that phosphorylation of L1-1176 is higher in C57BL/6 J mice than in C57BL/6 N mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that phosphorylation of multiple sites in the L1-CD is necessary for ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion, and that constitutive differences in phosphorylation of the L1-CD phosphorylation partly determine the susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis. Genes that encode proteins that regulate the phosphorylation of these sites might, therefore, be susceptibility genes for FASD.

N2  - Alcohol drinking inflicts a broad spectrum of consequences, which range fromundetectable effects to severe dysmorphology, growth retardation and neurodevelopmental deficits, which lead to diverse neurological abnormalities and psychosocial disabilities that are independent of dosage and stage of alcohol exposure. Can the genetic background contribute to such diversified phenotypic outcomes? The presence of several differential alcohol vulnerabilities among mouse strains, including C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2), support this hypothesis by holding alcohol factors constant to rule out the innate or interactive gene 9 environment differences. Using embryonic B6 and D2 cultures to eliminate confounding factors produced by the maternal environment, we demonstrated that the fetal genetic background contributes to the observed differences in alcohol (300-400 mg/dl) vulnerability at the organ (e.g. brain, heart and eye) and cellular levels (e.g. apoptosis and neural stem cell differentiation). Further, to identify the genomic signatures of the B6 and D2 strains, we mapped the B6 and D2 genomes onto release 66 (NCBI37/mm9) of the M. musculus genome from Ensembl using CLC GenomicsWorkbench V4.7.We then overlaid our Affymetrix expression data to identify strainspecific, fixed genomic loci that are differentially influenced by alcohol.We identified over 100,000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between the two strains. Using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we found ~1200 differentially expressed genes between B6 and D2. Over 400 contained SNVs between the two lines, indicating potential cis-acting elements at these loci. Using two-factor analysis, we determined that 11/54 genes exhibiting differential responses to alcohol (5%FDR) contain SNVs. These include Eya2 (Eyes absent Homolog 2), Csmd3 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3), Tac2 (Tachykinin 2), Apold1 (Apolipoprotein L Domain Containing 1), Psme4 (Proteasome). These findings warrant further analysis of genetic contribution to alcohol susceptibility. A better understanding of the innate and GXE interactions will contribute significantly to the understanding of the mechanism and diversity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and further the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD.

T1  - Higher functioning children with prenatal alcohol exposure: Is there a specific neurocognitive profile?

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Recent attempts to identify a neurocognitive profile of children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have led to an emerging "generalized deficit" conceptualization marked by diffuse information processing and integration difficulties as opposed to a specific profile. This study examines whether this conceptualization can be extended to higher functioning children with PAE who are without intellectual disability and addresses several limitations of previous research. One hundred twenty-five children aged 6-12 years with social skills deficits, 97 of whom met diagnostic criteria for a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), underwent a comprehensive, multi-informant assessment of neurocognitive, emotional, social, behavioral, and adaptive functioning. Multivariate analyses of variance examined differences in functioning between the PAE group and a nonexposed comparison group with and without controlling for child IQ. Results indicated that the PAE group returned significantly poorer scores than the nonexposed group on every construct assessed, including executive functioning, attention, working/visuospatial memory, linguistic abstraction, adaptive behavior, emotional/behavioral functioning, and social cognition. These differences largely maintained after controlling for IQ and were similar regardless of informant, although teachers reported somewhat fewer group differences. Within the PAE group, no differences were found across FASD subtypes. These results provide evidence extending the emerging generalized deficit conceptualization of children with PAE to those higher functioning individuals without global intellectual disability. © 2013 The Author(s).

N2  - Background There is a growing need for validated tools to screen children at risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The Neurobehavioral Screening Tool (NST) is one of several promising screening measures for FASD, though further evidence is needed to establish the tool's psychometric utility. Objective To assess the predictive accuracy of the NST among children with an FASD diagnosis, with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but no FASD diagnosis, and typically developing controls. Method The NST was completed by caregivers of children ages 6 to 17, including 48 with FASD, 22 with PAE, and 32 typically developing non-exposed controls. Predictive accuracy coefficients were calculated using Nash et al. (2006) criteria, and compared against controls. An alternative scoring scheme was also investigated to determine optimum referral thresholds using item-level total scores. Results The NST yielded 62.5% sensitivity for participants with FASD and 50% for PAE. Specificity values were 100% with no typically developing control scoring positive. Within the FASD group there was a trend for higher sensitivity among adolescents aged 12 to17 (70.8%) compared with children aged 6 to 11 years (54.2%), p = 0.23. Conclusion The findings support a growing body of literature evidencing psychometric promise for the clinical utility of the NST as an FASD screening tool, though further research on possible age-effects is warranted. The availability of a validated clinical screening tool for FASD, such as the NST, would aid in accurately screening a large number of children and lead to a timelier diagnostic referral. © 2014 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), characterized by significant changes in the physiology, structural plasticity of hippocampal function, including long-term deficits in learning and memory. Environmental enrichment has long been known to improve motor and cognitive function levels, causes several neurochemical and morphological alterations in the brain. Therefore, the effects of environmental enrichment on the neurobehavioral and neurotrophic changes in mice exposed prenatally to alcohol were investigated in this study. The pregnant dams were given 25 % ethanol (w/v) or isocaloric sucrose by liquid diet from gestation day 7 to 20. After weaning on postnatal day 28, offspring were exposed to standard cage (CC, CFAS) or enriched living conditions (CE, EFAS) for 8 weeks. Neurobehavioral studies both on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and place and cue learning strategy, a striatum-dependent test, were measured by the Morris water maze task. Moreover, the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was also used in order to study the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level in both the hippocampus and striatum of mice. Neurobehavioral studies show that animals exposed prenatally to alcohol were impaired as shown in both hippocampal-dependent spatial/ place and striatal-dependent response/cue learning tests. Moreover, the levels of BDNF expression both in the hippocampus and striatum of mice were also decreased. Interestingly, environmental enrichment can ameliorate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure both on the neurobehavioral and neurotrophic levels. These observations indicated that enriched environment attenuated memory impairment of prenatal alcohol exposure both in hippocampal and striatal circuitry.

N2  - The maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy causes birth defects and lifelong disabilities in the affected children. Due to the wide range of symptoms related to prenatal alcohol exposition, the umbrella term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is used. FASD covers full Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (pFAS). Children with FAS are smaller in length and weight than healthy children of their age. Head circumference is smaller as well. Typical signs of FAS are facial characteristics such small eyes, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip. Many affected children only show distinct behavioural problems (pFAS). Children with FAS or pFAS do not recognize dangerous situations, they would go with anyone, and are easily influenced. They are forgetful, do not learn from consequences. The diagnosis of FAS goes by small size and weight of the children, and the typical facial alterations. pFAS, however, is diagnosed if behavioural, social and emotional problems are present, and prenatal alcohol exposition is assured by anamnesis. Medical treatment is supplemented by occupational and behavioural therapy. The affected children need instruction, orientation, apportionment concerning time (and space), and a firm daily routine. At legal age, most patients with FASD are not able to live autonomously. They are naive and easily talked into things, therefore they require long-lasting care. Prevention and patient education, rather than being scaring, are supposed to invite and motivate pregnant women and their relatives to act responsible-minded.

N2  - Background. Suboptimal nutrition may explain the higher incidence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in disadvantaged populations. A clinical trial evaluated potential benefits of micronutrient supplementation, including choline, in an at risk populationin Khmelnitsky and Rivne, Omni-Net sites inWestern Ukraine. Methods. Alcohol-using and nondrinking women recruited mid-pregnancy were randomized to: 1) multivitamin/multimineral supplement (MVM); 2) MVM+ choline; 2) non-supplements. At 6-Months, children (N= 192) were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd ED) yielding standard scores for Mental Development Index (MDI), Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), orientation, emotional reactivity, and motor performance. Results. Generalized Linear Modeling evaluated the impact of amount of alcohol used preconceptionally and within pregnancy. We collapsed the two supplement groups (Suppl group) and controlled social class (SES), smoking, gender, vitamin and folic acid use prior to recruitment. MDI was significantly impacted by alcohol dose during pregnancy (beta = -14.66, X2 (1) =9.3, p < .002) with those exposed to more alcohol having lower cognitive scores. Those who received supplements performed better (beta = -3.69, X2(1) =8.03, p < .005). PDI scores did not differ by nutrition but showed a significant effect of alcohol dose during pregnancy (beta = -26.99, X2 (1) =8.28, p < .004). Orientation behavior also differed as a function of Suppl Group (beta = -5.45, X2 (1) =4.51, p < .03) and as a result of alcohol dose at conception (beta = -4.52,X 2 (1) =5.75, p < .02); Motor Optimality was affected by alcohol dose at conception and during pregnancy. Conclusions. Results suggest that multimicronutrient supplementation reduces negative impact of alcohol use during pregnancy on specific outcomes.

N2  - Background. The cardinal features of full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have been well-described. However, prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broader spectrum of structural defects with implications regarding the mechanisms of alcohol's effects on the developing fetus. Methods. We examined 831 children from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) using a structured protocol for diagnosis of FASD. Each child was evaluated for the cardinal facial and growth features, as well as for additional structural defects thought to occur more often in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects were classified as FAS, Deferred or No FAS. Groups were compared on prevalence of additional features observed, and were stratified by diagnostic category for sex, race and age. Results. Of the eight additional features evaluated, there was a statistically significant increase in seven. Children in the FAS group had the highest prevalence of additional features and those in the No FAS group had the lowest. Four of the additional features, including decreased elbow pronation/supination, decreased finger extension, hockey stick palmar crease, and other palmar crease abnormalities, could be related to decreased fetal movement, the result of the effect of alcohol on early brain development. The frequency of additional structural features varied by age and race of the child. Conclusions. This study shows that prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broad spectrum of structural defects, which is critical in documenting the true prevalence of this disorder.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt development, leading to life-long cognitive deficits. We have reported that the essential nutrient choline can protect against alcohol-induced behavioral deficits, even when administered after developmental alcohol exposure. Specifically, postnatal choline administration improves performance on memory tasks that depend on the functional integrity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Choline likely improves cognitive performance by acting as a methyl donor, a precursor to cell membranes, and/or as a precursor to acetylcholine. Using a rat model, we examined the effects of developmental alcohol exposure and postnatal choline supplementation on cholinergic receptors. Sprague-Dawley rats received ethanol (5.25 g/kg/ day) or sham intubations from postnatal days (PD) 4-9, and were treated with choline (100 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or saline from PD 10-30. On PD 38, quantitative autoradiography was used to measure nicotinic cholinergic receptor densities. Alcohol significantly reduced alpha7 receptor densities in the PFC, the amygdala, and hippocampus. Choline attenuated some of these effects, although receptor densities were still lower than those of controls. In contrast, alcohol significantly increased non-alpha7 receptor densities in various forebrain structures, and choline selectively reduced receptor densities to control levels, but only in the PFC. Choline had no significant effect on nicotinic receptor densities among the controls. Alcohol-induced alterations in cholinergic functioning likely contribute to the cognitive impairments caused by developmental alcohol exposure. These results suggest that choline supplementation may serve as an effective treatment for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, in part, by altering ethanol's action on cholinergic development and functioning.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can induce important anomalies in the developing brain, being embryogenesis an important critical period for the craniofacial defects and mental disabilities associated with foetal alcohol syndrome. We generate neural progenitors (NPs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to reproduce early stages of human brain development and we evaluate the effects of ethanol during early embryogenesis. We show that neuroepithelial progenitors display the morphological and functional characteristics of their embryonic counterparts, and the proper timing of neurons and glia cells generation, reproducing the early stages of human brain development. Immunocytochemical and RT-PCR analyses reveal that cells appeared as clusters during neuroepithelial cell proliferation, and that the genes associated with the neuroectodermal (Pax-6) and the endodermic (alpha-fetoprotein, AFP) lineages decreased in parallel to the up-regulation of the genes of neural progenitors (nestin, Tuj1), followed by their differentiation into neurons (MAP-2 + , GABA+), oligodendrocytes (GalC+) and astrocytes (GFAP+). Ethanol exposure (25 mM) impairs the derivation of hESCs towards NPs, altering the disappearance of the neuroectodermal and endodermic markers PAX-6 and AFP, as well as the Nanog and Sox2 expression, suggesting that ethanol alters cell fate and maintains the NPs in undifferented state. Ethanol also impairs the differentiation of NPs into mature neurons and astrocytes (e.g. MAP-2, GFAP, GABA). These results provide evidence that exposure to alcohol during early embryogenesis, alters cell fate and disrupts the transformation of NPs into mature neural cells. These effects could contribute to the mechanisms that lead to the abnormal craniofacial defects associated with FASD.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to impairment in cerebellar structure and function, including eyeblink conditioning. The deep cerebellar nuclei, which play a critical role in cerebellar-mediated learning, receive extensive inputs from brain stem and cerebellar cortex and provide the point of origin for most of the output fibers to other regions of the brain. We used in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurochemistry in this important cerebellar region. Methods: MRS data from the deep cerebellar nuclei were acquired from 37 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 17 non- or minimally exposed controls from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa. Results: Increased maternal alcohol consumption around time of conception was associated with lower N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in the deep nuclei (r = -0.33, p < 0.05). Higher levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to lower levels of the choline-containing metabolites (r = -0.37, p < 0.01), glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine (Cho). Alcohol consumption levels both at conception (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and during pregnancy (r = 0.38, p < 0.01) were related to higher levels of glutamate plus glutamine (Glx). All these effects continued to be significant after controlling for potential confounders. Conclusions: The lower NAA levels seen in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure may reflect impaired neuronal integrity in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Our finding of lower Cho points to disrupted Cho metabolism of membrane phospholipids, reflecting altered neuropil development with potentially reduced content of dendrites and synapses. The alcohol-related alterations in Glx may suggest a disruption of the glutamate-glutamine cycling involved in glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Invited commentary on Australian fetal alcohol spectrum disorder diagnostic guidelines
A1  - Astley S.J.
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The publication of Australian fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) diagnostic guidelines marks an important step forward in Australia's efforts to prevent FASD. But do we need yet another set of FASD guidelines? At the 5th International FASD Conference, the ever growing number of FASD diagnostic guidelines was identified as a core area of concern by leaders in FASD worldwide. All agreed we need to strive to adopt a single set of guidelines. It is essential that FASD diagnosis advance to incorporate new knowledge and technology. But to date, the field of FASD has seen multiple sets of guidelines published that do not address the important question-How is the performance of these new guidelines superior to the performance of existing guidelines to warrant/justify their introduction into the medical literature?The Australian guidelines include FAS, PFAS and Neurodevelopmental Disorder-Alcohol Exposed (ND-AE). This latter group includes individuals with severe CNS abnormalities without the physical features of FAS. This is the group the 4-Digit-Code calls Static-Encephalopathy-Alcohol-Exposed (SE-AE). The criteria for FAS, PFAS, and ND-AE (or what the 4-Digit-Code calls SE-AE) are identical between the Australian and 4-Digit-Code guidelines with the exception of one very small, but very consequential difference in facial criteria for PFAS. The 4-Digit-Code requires a Rank 3 FAS facial phenotype for PFAS (J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol 20(3):e416-e467, 2013); the Australian guidelines relax the criteria to include the Rank 2 FAS facial phenotype. This relaxation of the criteria renders the facial phenotype NOT specific to prenatal alcohol exposure as confirmed in published empirical studies. If the facial phenotype is not specific to (caused only by) prenatal alcohol exposure one can no longer validly call the outcome PFAS. When one makes a diagnosis of FAS (full or partial), one is stating explicitly that the individual has a syndrome caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. One is also stating explicitly that the biological mother drank alcohol during pregnancy and, as a result, harmed her child. These are bold conclusions to draw and are not without medical, ethical, and even legal consequences. So the question remains-Why go against the published empirical evidence and relax the PFAS facial criteria into the normal range? © 2014 Astley; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) consists of a pattern of mental and physical defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. The disorder is well described during childhood while little is known about adults. This ongoing study investigates Swedish adults with FAS regarding their socieconomic situation by variables such as state of employment, early retirement from work, dependence on public welfare, criminality, marital and parental state, mortality rate, and medical care. Adults with FAS (N=80, age 19 to 49 years, mean age 30 years, 63% men) and a comparison group matched to gender and age (N=2664) are included. Data are obtained from the Swedish Governmental Office of Statistics, National Board of Health and Welfare, Enforcement Authorities, and the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. Up to now data show that 54% of the adults with FAS and 26% of the comparison group (p<0.05) were unemployed. Thirty-three percent of the study group versus 3% of the comparison group (p<0.001) had retired early from work. Twenty-six percent of the individuals with FAS and six percent of the comparison group (p<0.001) were dependent on public welfare. Eighty percent of the study group and 50% of the comparison group (p<0.01) were living as singles (i.e., without their children), if any, and/or a partner. The results indicate that the adults with FAS had a difficult socioeconomic situation compared with their gender and age-matched persons. Such knowledge might be useful in understanding and providing support to this vulnerable and socially-exposed population.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are thought to be a leading cause of developmental disabilities worldwide. However, data are lacking on alcohol use among pregnant women in many countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of alcohol consumption by pregnant women in Ukraine. Methods: Cross-sectional screening of pregnant women was conducted in 2 regions of Ukraine during the recruitment phase of an ongoing clinical study that is part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. Women attending a routine prenatal visit at 1 of 2 participating regional centers were asked about alcohol consumption. Quantity and frequency of alcoholic beverages consumed in the month around conception and in the most recent month of pregnancy were measured using a standard interview instrument. Results: Between 2007 and 2012, 11,909 pregnant women were screened on average in the second trimester of pregnancy. Of these, 92.7% reported being ever-drinkers. Among ever-drinkers, 54.8% reported drinking alcohol in the month around conception and 12.9% consumed at least 3 drinks on at least 1 day in that time period. In the most recent month of pregnancy, 46.3% continued to report alcohol use and 9.2% consumed at least 3 drinks per day. Significant predictors of average number of drinks or heavier drinking per day in either time period in pregnancy included lower gravidity, being single, unmarried/living with a partner, or separated, lower maternal education, smoking, younger age at initiation of drinking, and higher score on the TWEAK screening test for harmful drinking. Conclusions: These findings support the need for education/intervention in women of childbearing age in Ukraine and can help inform targeted interventions for women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The initiation of a standard screening protocol in pregnancy is a step in the right direction. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Adipose tissue secretes numerous bioactive peptides ("adipocytokines"). Visceral fat mediates inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, subcutaneous fat is the principal source of adiponectin production. Adiponectin, consisting of 247 amino acids and single nucleotide polymorphisms (mutations), causes hypoadiponectinemia. Individuals with this mutation are highly susceptible for development of insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, hypertention, and left ventricular hypertrophy. We hypothesize that alcohol consumption during pregnancy may alter endocrine signaling, by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines thus inducing fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Even low-dose/or short duration ethanol exposure early in development can produce more subtle effects by alteration of subcutaneous fat and subsequently, decrease in adiponectin production. Zebrafish eggs (AB strain) were raised in water (control) or in 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, and 2.5% ethanol solution for one of 3dpf, 5 dpf, 10 dpf, 15dpf, or 20dpf. Anatomical measures including heart diameter and total body length were compared across groups. At the concentration of 2.5%, there were more abnormal physical distortions and significantly higher mortality rates than any other group. Nile Red (NR) and Oil Red O (ORO) staining was used to detect adipogenesis (visceral vs subcutaneous) fat depots. Adipogenesis during zebrafish development was altered and subcutaneous fat was depleted at 15pft after 2% alcohol exposure compared with control. The expression of an "adipogenic" transcriptional program including PPAR, SREBP1c, CEBPalpha and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, HIF-1alpha ROS, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB was altered, as evident from quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We conclude that exposure of zebrafish larvae to ethanol during development results in modified external and internal morphological development and that the severity of these effects is due to remarkable changes in adiposity and hypoadiponectinemia.

These co-occurring public health problems raise the need to understand alcohol consumption among trauma-exposed pregnant women in this setting. Since a known predictor of drinking during pregnancy is drinking behavior before pregnancy, this study explored the relationship between women's drinking levels before and after pregnancy recognition, and whether traumatic experiences - childhood abuse or recent intimate partner violence (IPV) - moderated this relationship.Methods:Women with incident pregnancies (N = 66) were identified from a longitudinal cohort of 560 female drinkers in a township of Cape Town, South Africa. Participants were included if they reported no pregnancy at one assessment and then reported pregnancy four months later at the next assessment. Alcohol use was measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and traumatic experiences of childhood abuse and recent IPV were also assessed. Hierarchical linear regressions controlling for race and age examined childhood abuse and recent IPV as moderators of the effect of pre-pregnancy recognition drinking on post-pregnancy recognition AUDIT scores.Results:Following pregnancy recognition, 73% of women reported drinking at hazardous levels (AUDIT > 8). Sixty-four percent reported early and/or recent exposure to trauma. While drinking levels before pregnancy significantly predicted drinking levels after pregnancy recognition, t(64) = 3.50, p <.01, this relationship was moderated by experiences of childhood abuse, B =577, t(60) = -2.58, p =.01, and recent IPV, B =477, t(60) = -2.16, p =.04. Pregnant women without traumatic experiences reported drinking at levels consistent with levels before pregnancy recognition. However, women with traumatic experiences tended to report elevated AUDIT scores following pregnancy recognition, even if low-risk drinkers previously.Conclusion:This study explored how female drinkers in South Africa may differentially modulate their drinking patterns upon pregnancy recognition, depending on trauma history. Our results suggest that women with traumatic experiences are more likely to exhibit risky alcohol consumption when they become pregnant, regardless of prior risk. These findings illuminate the relevance of trauma-informed efforts to reduce FASD in South Africa. © 2014 Choi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is an umbrella term that refers to a wide range of behavioral and cognitive deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. It involves changes in brain gene expression that underlie lifelong FASD symptoms. How these changes are achieved from immediate to long-term effects, and how they are maintained, is unknown. We have used the C57BL/6J mouse to assess the dynamics of genomic alterations following binge alcohol exposure. Ethanol-exposed fetal (short-term effect) and adult (long-term effect) brains were assessed for gene expression and microRNA (miRNA) changes using Affymetrix mouse arrays. We identified 48 and 68 differentially expressed genes in short- and long-term groups, respectively. No gene was common between the 2 groups. Short-term (immediate) genes were involved in cellular compromise and apoptosis, which represent ethanol's toxic effects. Long-term genes were involved in various cellular functions, including epigenetics. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed the downregulation of long-term genes: Camk1g, Ccdc6, Egr3, Hspa5, and Xbp1. miRNA arrays identified 20 differentially expressed miRNAs, one of which (miR-302c) was confirmed. miR-302c was involved in an inverse relationship with Ccdc6. A network-based model involving altered genes illustrates the importance of cellular redox, stress and inflammation in FASD. Our results also support a critical role of apoptosis in FASD, and the potential involvement of miRNAs in the adaptation of gene expression following prenatal ethanol exposure. The ultimate molecular footprint involves inflammatory disease, neurological disease and skeletal and muscular disorders as major alterations in FASD. At the cellular level, these processes represent abnormalities in redox, stress and inflammation, with potential underpinnings to anxiety. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study is in collaboration with MaternalInfant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC), a look into the Canadian profile of in utero exposures through meconium analysis. The focus of this study was to investigate the incidence of heavy alcohol use during pregnancy in Canada through meconium analysis. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) serve as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. This study is the first to investigate alcohol use during pregnancy in Canada through meconium FAEE analysis. METHODS: Meconium was collected from 1,537 newborns at 11 obstetric units across Canada and participating mothers also completed questionnaires that contained a section focusing on alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. The questionnaires will serve as a maternal self-report and will be compared to meconium FAEE concentration. Any meconium sample with a total FAEE concentration (the sum of ethyl palmitate, oleate, stearate and linoleate concentrations) greater than 2 nmol/g meconium is classified as positive for excessive alcohol consumption during the second and/or third trimesters of pregnancy. RESULTS: Thus far, 82 samples have been processed, with 62 eligible for analysis. Of the samples analyzed, 10 were deemed transitional and results inconclusive and 2 were identified as positive. This equates to a 3.22% positivity rate for heavy fetal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSION: Through this study, heavy alcohol use rates in a pregnant population in Canada will be determined. Meconium FAEE analysis via GC-MS is currently ongoing at the Motherisk Laboratory.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is a leading cause of significant neurobehavioral and neurocognitive deficits. Its potential consequences for eating behaviors, nutritional status, and other nutritional issues in childhood have received little attention. Methods: Nineteen children (11 boys, 8 girls) of mean age 9.6 years, referred for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) screening and assessment, were analyzed with physical exams and caregiver questionnaires to identify possible abnormalities in food and eating behaviors. Fourteen children contributed 24-hour diet recalls and were assessed for nutritional status. Results: Seventy-nine percent of participants were diagnosed with FASD and 63.2% had confirmed PAE. Fifty percent of girls were overweight or obese, whereas 37% of boys had reduced stature, weight, or body mass index for their age. Recurring feeding problems included constant snacking (36.8%), lack of satiety (26.3%), and picky eating/poor appetite (31.6%). None had oral feeding problems. Constipation was common (26.3%). Macronutrient intakes were largely normal, but sugar consumption was excessive (140 to 190% of recommendations) in 57% of subjects. Vitamin A intake exceeded the upper limit for 64% of participants, whereas >50% had intakes <80% of recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for choline, vitamin E, potassium, beta-carotene, and essential fatty acids; 100% had vitamin D intakes <80% of the RDA. Conclusions: PAE may be associated with altered acquisition and distribution of body mass with increasing age. Disordered eating was common. The increased feeding behaviors surrounding lack of satiety suggest that self-regulation may be altered. Constipation could reflect low dietary fiber or altered gastrointestinal function. These exploratory data suggest that children with PAE may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies, which are influenced by inappropriate food preferences, disordered eating patterns, medication use, and the stressful dynamics surrounding food preparation and mealtime. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Adolescent binge alcohol exposure has long-lasting effects on the expression of hypothalamic genes that regulate the stress response, even in the absence of subsequent adult alcohol exposure. This suggests that alcohol can induce permanent gene expression changes, potentially through epigenetic modifications to specific genes. Epigenetic modifications can be transmitted to future generations therefore, and in these studies we investigated the effects of adolescent binge alcohol exposure on hypothalamic gene expression patterns in the F1 generation offspring. It has been well documented that maternal alcohol exposure during fetal development can have devastating neurological consequences. However, less is known about the consequences of maternal and/or paternal alcohol exposure outside of the gestational time frame. Here, we exposed adolescent male and female rats to a repeated binge EtOH exposure paradigm and then mated them in adulthood. Hypothalamic samples were taken from the offspring of these animals at postnatal day (PND) 7 and subjected to a genome-wide microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR for selected genes. Importantly, the parents were not intoxicated at the time of mating and were not exposed to EtOH at any time during gestation therefore the offspring were never directly exposed to EtOH. Our results showed that the offspring of alcohol-exposed parents had significant differences compared to offspring from alcohol-naive parents. Specifically, major differences were observed in the expression of genes that mediate neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity during neurodevelopment, genes important for directing chromatin remodeling, posttranslational modifications or transcription regulation, as well as genes involved in regulation of obesity and reproductive function. These data demonstrate that repeated binge alcohol exposure during pubertal development can potentially have detrimental effects on future offspring even in the absence of direct fetal alcohol exposure. © 2014 Przybycien-Szymanska et al.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Detection of at-risk alcohol consumption during pregnancy is essential for prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs), with the widely used T-ACE screen developed for that purpose. Recent work with an urban cohort revealed that increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point from 2 to 3 doubled specificity of detecting risk drinking in pregnancy without reducing sensitivity substantially. The goal of this study was to further validate a cut-point of 3 (TACER-3) in a rural cohort. METHODS: Prospectively recruited pregnant patients (n=540) completed the T-ACE and a simple alcohol questionnaire that assessed the women's self-reported typical pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption. RESULTS: 22.2% of participants were positive on the T-ACE (cutpoint =2) compared to 5.4% positive on the TACER-3 (cut-point =3). An ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD contrasts revealed that "At- Risk" women (positive on T-ACE and TACER-3) reported consuming significantly more alcohol per day before pregnancy than both the "Notat- Risk" (negative on both on T-ACE and TACER-3) and "Change Risk" (positive on T-ACE but not TACER-3) women (omnibus F=22.3, p<.001). The rate of average daily alcohol use among women in the "Change Risk" group was not significantly different than women in the "No Risk" group. Relative Risk scores indicated that women in the TACER-3-positive "At- Risk" group were 6.6 times more likely to drink alcohol at risk levels (>0.5 absolute oz./day) than women in the "No-Risk" group, and 2.6 times more likely than women in the "Change Risk" group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the original T-ACE, the TACER-3 was more effective at selectively identifying women who were drinking at risk level prior to pregnancy recognition in this rural cohort. These analyses further validate prior findings that using the TACER-3 reduces "false positives." The TACER-3 allows for more efficient use of health care provider time in directing targeted clinical interventions with those pregnant women most at risk for adverse fetal outcomes.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, a continuum of physiological, behavioural, and cognitive phenotypes that include increased risk for anxiety and learning-associated disorders. Prenatal alcohol exposure results in life-long disorders that may manifest in part through the induction of long-term gene expression changes, potentially maintained through epigenetic mechanisms. Findings: Here we report a decrease in the expression of Canabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1) and an increase in the expression of the regulatory microRNA miR-26b in the brains of adult mice exposed to ethanol during neurodevelopment. Furthermore, we show that miR-26b has significant complementarity to the 3'-UTR of the Cnr1 transcript, giving it the potential to bind and reduce the level of Cnr1 expression. Conclusions: These findings elucidate a mechanism through which some genes show long-term altered expression following prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to persistent alterations to cognitive function and behavioural phenotypes observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2013 Stringer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: South Africa has one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in the world. However, little is known about what men and women who attend alcohol serving establishments believe about alcohol use during pregnancy and how these beliefs may be related to alcohol use. Objectives: To understand FASD beliefs and related behaviors among men and women attending alcohol-serving establishments. Methods: We surveyed 1047 men (n=565) and women (n=482) -including pregnant women and men with pregnant partners- attending alcohol serving establishments in a township located in Cape Town, South Africa. Results: Among both pregnant (n=53) and non-pregnant (n=429) women, 54% reported drinking alcohol at least 2-4 times per month, and 57% reported having at least 3-4 alcohol drinks during a typical drinking session. Pregnant women were less likely to believe that they should not drink alcohol and that alcohol can harm a fetus when compared to non-pregnant women. Similar findings were observed between men with pregnant partners compared to men without pregnant partners. Among women, beliefs about how much alcohol pregnant women can safely drink were associated with self-reported alcohol use. Conclusions: Efforts to address FASD need to focus on understanding how men and women perceive alcohol use during pregnancy and situational factors that contribute to alcohol consumption among pregnant women attending alcohol serving establishments. Structural and individual-level interventions targeting women at alcohol serving establishments should be prioritized to mitigate alcohol use during pregnancy. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Aims: Although Russia has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable burden of disease, little is known about the existing research on prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) in this country. The objective of this study was to locate and review published and unpublished studies related to any aspect of PAE and FASD conducted in or using study populations from Russia. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple English and Russian electronic bibliographic databases. In addition, a manual search was conducted in several major libraries in Moscow. Results: The search revealed a small pool of existing research studies related to PAE and/or FASD in Russia (126: 22 in English and 104 in Russian). Existing epidemiological data indicate a high prevalence of PAE and FASD, which underlines the strong negative impact that alcohol has on mortality, morbidity and disability in Russia. High levels of alcohol consumption by women of childbearing age, low levels of contraception use, and low levels of knowledge by health and other professionals regarding the harmful effects of PAE put this country at great risk of further alcohol-affected pregnancies. Conclusions: Alcohol preventive measures in Russia warrant immediate attention. More research focused on alcohol prevention and policy is needed in order to reduce alcohol-related harm, especially in the field of FASD. © The Author 2013.

N2  - Alcohol consumption by mothers during pregnancy causes a fetal alcohol syndrome associated with massive neuronal apoptosis. We have recently shown that taurine at a dose of 2 g/kg saves about 50% of dying cerebellar neurons from ethanol-induced apoptosis in 7-day-old mice. However, a further increase in the taurine dose to ethanol-treated mice had a toxic and in some cases lethal effect. In the present work we studied the toxic effects of taurine and ethanol coadministration in three age groups: 7-day-old, adult (5 to 6 months old), and old (12 to 13 months old) mice. Taurine and ethanol were injected in two half-doses: taurine at 0 and 4 h and ethanol at 1 and 3 h. The minimal 100% lethal doses in coadministration of taurine and ethanol were the following: 7-day-old mice-6 g/kg taurine + 5 g/kg ethanol, adult mice-10 g/kg of taurine + 8 g/kg of ethanol, and old mice-above 6 g/kg of taurine + 6 g/kg of ethanol. All mice treated with taurine or ethanol alone survived. The adult and old mice dying from the combined toxicity of taurine and ethanol showed a marked fall in blood glucose, which may be one reason for lethality. A comparison of the lethal doses of taurine and ethanol coadministration in different age groups allows us to conclude that the adverse effect of the combined toxicity of taurine and ethanol is age dependent. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

N2  - Background: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that emotional withdrawal is an early indicator of affective disorder in infants heavily exposed prenatally to alcohol, which is independent of alcohol-related effects on mother-infant interaction and temperament and discriminated between children later diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS) and predicted cognitive and affective outcomes at 5 and 9 years. Methods: The sample consisted of Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) infants, whose mothers were interviewed during pregnancy regarding their alcohol consumption using a timeline follow-back approach. Infant emotional withdrawal (n = 85) was assessed on the Alarm Distress Baby Scale at 6.5 months. Mother-infant interaction was evaluated from video recordings during free play and infant feeding at 6.5 months (n = 127). Infant temperament was assessed by maternal report on the EAS Temperament Survey at 13 months (n = 119). Sociodemographic and psychological correlates of maternal alcohol use and infant iron deficiency were examined as potential confounders. The children were diagnosed for FAS/PFAS by expert dysmorphologists at 5 years, cognitive and affective function at 5 and 9 years. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with increased infant emotional withdrawal and decreased activity, but unrelated to mother-infant interaction or any other temperament measures. Children later diagnosed with FAS and PFAS at 5 years exhibited more emotional withdrawal and less responsivity and activity as infants. Infant withdrawal, responsivity, quality of interaction, and maternal sensitivity also predicted poorer IQ and affective response at 5 and 9 years. When all 4 infant affective measures were examined simultaneously in a regression analysis, only infant emotional withdrawal persisted as a significant predictor of 9-year IQ. Conclusions: This study is the first to document a direct effect of fetal alcohol exposure on emotional withdrawal in infancy. These data link prenatal alcohol to a specific aspect of infant affective function not attributable to mother-infant interaction, infant temperament, or other socioemotional aspects of the infant's environment and identify infant emotional withdrawal as an early indicator of affective disturbance, particularly in children later diagnosed with FAS and PFAS. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Ethanol is known as a potent teratogen responsible for the fetal alcohol syndrome characterized by cognitive deficits especially pronounced in juveniles but ameliorating in adults. Since the mechanisms of these deficits and following partial recovery are not fully elucidated, the aim of the present study was to investigate the process of synaptogenesis in the hippocampus over the first two months of life in control and fetal-alcohol rats. Ethanol was delivered to the pregnant dams by intragastric intubation throughout 7-21 gestation days at the daily dose of 6. g/kg generating a mean blood alcohol level of 246.6 +/- 40.9 mg/dl on gestation day 20. The spine densities as well as the expression of pre- and postsynaptic proteins, synaptophysin (SYP) and PSD-95 protein, were evaluated for three distinct hippocampal regions: CA1, CA2+3, and DG and four postnatal days: PD1, PD10, PD30 and PD60, independently. Our results confirmed an intensive synaptogenesis within the brain spurt period (first 10 postnatal days), however, the temporal pattern of changes in the SYP and PSD-95 expression was different. The ethanol exposure during half of the 1st and the whole 2nd human trimester equivalent resulted in an overall trend toward lower values of synaptic indices at PD1 with a fast recovery from these deficits observed already at PD10. At PD30, around the age when the most pronounced behavioral deficits have been previously reported in juvenile fetal-alcohol subjects, no significant changes were found in either the hippocampal levels of synaptic proteins or in the spine density in principal hippocampal neurons. © 2013 ISDN.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Background: Previous studies on male rodents found that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) decreases the number of serotonin immunoreactive (5-HT-ir) neurons in the brainstem. However, data on the effects of PAE in females are lacking. In light of known sex differences in responsiveness of the 5-HT system and known effects of estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) in the brain, we hypothesized that sex steroids will modulate the adverse effects of PAE on 5-HT neurons in adult females. Methods: Adult females from 3 prenatal groups (Prenatal alcohol-exposed [PAE], Pair-fed [PF], and ad libitum-fed Controls [C]) were ovariectomized (OVX), with or without hormone replacement, or underwent Sham OVX. 5-HT-ir cells were examined in key brainstem areas. Results: Our data support the hypothesis that PAE has long-term effects on the 5-HT system of females and that ovarian steroids have a modulatory role in these effects. Intact (Sham OVX) PAE females had marginally lower numbers of 5-HT-ir neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the brainstem compared with PF and C females. This marginal difference became significant following removal of hormones by OVX. Replacement with E2 restored the number of 5-HT-ir neurons in PAE females to control levels, while P4 reversed the effects of E2. Importantly, despite these differential responses of the 5-HT system to ovarian steroids, there were no differences in E2 and P4 levels among prenatal treatment groups. Conclusions: These data demonstrate long-term, adverse effects of PAE on the 5-HT system of females, as well as differential sensitivity of PAE compared with control females to the modulatory effects of ovarian steroids on 5-HT neurons. Our findings have important implications for understanding sex differences in 5-HT dysfunction in depression/anxiety disorders and the higher rates of these mental health problems in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Introduction: It is well established that individuals exposed to alcohol in utero have reduced cortical grey matter volumes. However, the candidate determinants of these reductions, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), have not been investigated exclusively in alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), the most prevalent fetal alcohol spectrum disorder subgroup that lacks the characteristic facial dysmorphology. Methods: T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 88 participants (8-16 years), 36 diagnosed with ARND and 52 typically developing controls. Scans were submitted to the CIVET pipeline (version 1.1.10). Deformable models were used to construct the inner white matter surfaces and pial surfaces from which CT and SA measures were derived. Group differences in cortical volume, CT, and SA were computed using a general linear model covaried for age, sex, and handedness. Results: Global cortical volume reductions in ARND did not reflect CT, which did not differ between groups. Instead, volume decreases were consistent with global SA reductions in bilateral frontal and temporal as well as right occipital regions. Local reductions in SA were observed in the right superior temporal gyrus and the right occipital-temporal region. Conclusion: Results suggest that in ARND, prenatal alcohol exposure perturbs global SA to a greater degree than CT, particularly in the right temporal lobe. © 2013 The Authors.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) frequently exhibit impairment on tasks measuring inhibition. The objective of this study was to determine if a performance-based relationship exists between psychometric tests and eye movement tasks in children with FASD. Participants for this dataset were aged 5-17 years and included those diagnosed with an FASD (n= 72), those with PAE but no clinical FASD diagnosis (n= 21), and typically developing controls (n= 139). Participants completed a neurobehavioral test battery, which included the NEPSY-II subtests of auditory attention, response set, and inhibition. Each participant completed a series of saccadic eye movement tasks, which included the antisaccade and memory-guided tasks. Both the FASD and the PAE groups performed worse than controls on the subtest measures of attention and inhibition. Compared with controls, the FASD group made more errors on the antisaccade and memory-guided tasks. Among the combined FASD/PAE group, inhibition and switching errors were negatively correlated with direction errors on the antisaccade task but not on the memory-guided task. There were no significant correlations in the control group. These data suggests that response inhibition deficits in children with FASD/PAE are associated with difficulty controlling saccadic eye movements which may point to overlapping brain regions damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. The results of this study demonstrate that eye movement control tasks directly relate to outcome measures obtained with psychometric tests that are used during FASD diagnosis, and may therefore help with early identification of children who would benefit from a multidisciplinary diagnostic assessment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Concise, accurate measures of maternal prenatal alcohol use are needed to better understand fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Measures of drinking by mothers of children with specific FASD diagnoses and mothers of randomly-selected controls are compared and also correlated with physical and cognitive/behavioral outcomes. Results: Measures of maternal alcohol use can differentiate maternal drinking associated with FASD from that of controls and some from mothers of alcohol-exposed normals. Six variables that combine quantity and frequency concepts distinguish mothers of FASD children from normal controls. Alcohol use variables, when applied to each trimester and three months prior to pregnancy, provide insight on critical timing of exposure as well. Measures of drinking, especially bingeing, correlate significantly with increased child dysmorphology and negative cognitive/behavioral outcomes in children, especially low non-verbal IQ, poor attention, and behavioral problems. Logistic regression links (p< .001) first trimester drinking (vs. no drinking) with FASD, elevating FASD likelihood 12 times; first and second trimester drinking increases FASD outcomes 61 times; and drinking in all trimesters 65 times. Conversely, a similar regression (p= .008) indicates that drinking only in the first trimester makes the birth of a child with an FASD 5 times less likely than drinking in all trimesters. Conclusions: There is significant variation in alcohol consumption both within and between diagnostic groupings of mothers bearing children diagnosed within the FASD continuum. Drinking measures are empirically identified and correlated with specific child outcomes. Alcohol use, especially heavy use, should be avoided throughout pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - There are no biological treatments for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), lifelong conditions associated with physical anomalies, brain damage, and neurocognitive abnormalities. In preclinical studies, choline partially ameliorates memory and learning deficits from prenatal alcohol exposure. This phase I pilot study evaluated the feasibility, tolerability, and potential adverse effects of choline supplementation in children with FASD. We hypothesized that choline would be well tolerated with minimal adverse events. The study design was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Participants included 20 children aged 2.5 to 4.9 years with prenatal alcohol exposure and FASD diagnoses. Participants were randomly assigned to 500 mg choline or placebo daily for 9 months (10 active, 10 placebo). Primary outcome measures included feasibility, tolerability, adverse effects, and serum choline levels. Seventeen participants completed the study. Compliance was 82% to 87%, as evidenced by parent-completed log sheets and dose counts. Periodic 24-hour dietary recalls showed no evidence of dietary confounding. Adverse events were minimal and were equivalent in the active and placebo arms with the exception of fishy body odor, which occurred only in the active group. There were no serious adverse events to research participants. This phase I pilot study demonstrates that choline supplementation at 500 mg/d for 9 months in children aged 2 to 5 years is feasible and has high tolerability. Further examination of the efficacy of choline supplementation in FASD is currently underway. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Describe the intellectual performance in a sample of children and adolescents that suffered prenatal exposure of alcohol. Methods: This report constitutes a case series study, comprising 10 subjects between 6 and 16 years old, with a history of fetal alcohol exposure. These subjects underwent a medical evaluation to be characterized as a clinical sample, respecting the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously established. The sample's intellectual performance was studied by means of instruments: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 3rd. Edition (WISC-III) and Raven's Progressive Matrices Test. Results: The sample was evaluated as being of low medium performance by the WISC-III. In the Raven Test the sample exhibited medium intellectual performance. Among all of the WISC-III indexes, Resistance to Distractions was most impaired. The Arithmetic and Picture Arrangement subtests showed more impairment results in comparison of the others subtests. As a secondary consequence, the impairment of these functions can cause difficulties in learning and social interaction and impact the development of these young people. Conclusions: The results of these series of ten cases were compared to those reported in national and international studies. The cognitive impairment caused by alcohol use during pregnancy can manifest in school-age children through learning difficulties and difficulty in establishing social interactions. Thus, prenatal exposure to alcohol becomes a public health issue which needs greater attention from national policies to carry out identification and early intervention.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by excess alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Using an in vitro system, we examined the role that chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure plays in gene expression changes during the early stage of embryonic differentiation. We demonstrated that EtOH affected the cell morphology, cell cycle progression and also delayed the down-regulation of OCT4 and NANOG during differentiation. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis demonstrated that EtOH deregulates many genes and pathways that are involved in early embryogenesis. Follow-up analyzes revealed that EtOH exposure to embryoid bodies (EBs) induced the expression of an organizer-specific gene, goosecoid (GSC), in comparison to controls. Moreover, EtOH treatment altered several important genes that are involved in embryonic structure formation, nervous system development, and placental and embryonic vascularization, which are all common processes that FASD can disrupt. Specifically, EtOH treatment let to a reduction in ALDOC, ENO2 and CDH1 expression, whereas EtOH treatment induced the expression of PTCH1, EGLN1, VEGFA and DEC2 in treated EBs. We also found that folic acid (FA) treatment was able to correct the expression of the majority of genes deregulated by EtOH exposure during early embryo development. Finally, the present study identified a gene set including GSC, which was deregulated by EtOH exposure that may contribute to the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). We also reported that EtOH-induced GSC expression is mediated by Nodal signaling, which may provide a new avenue for analyzing the molecular mechanisms behind EtOH teratogenicity in FASD individuals.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure, especially during early pregnancy, can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome. The pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms of ethanol are related to the effects of ceramide. In this study, we established an alcohol exposure model in wild-type mice and in knockout mice for the key enzyme involved in ceramide metabolism, sphingomyelin synthase 2. This model received daily intragastric administration of 25% ethanol, and pups were used at postnatal days 0, 7, 14, 30 for experiments. Serology and immunofluorescence staining found that ethanol exposure dose-dependently reduced blood sphingomyelin levels in two genotypes of pups, and increased neural cell proliferation and the number of new neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Western blot analysis showed that the relative expression level of protein kinase C alpha increased in two notypes of pups after ethanol exposure. Compared with wild-type pups, the expression level of the important activator protein of the ceramide/ceramide-1-phosphate pathway, protein kinase C alpha, was reduced in the hippocampus of sphingomyelin synthase 2 knockouts. Our findings illustrate that ceramide is involved in alcohol-induced neural proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of pups after prenatal ethanol exposure, and the mechanism may be associated with increased pression of protein kinase C alpha activating the ceramide/ceramide-1-phosphate pathway.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are debilitating, with effects of prenatal alcohol exposure persisting into adolescence and adulthood. Complete characterization of FASD is crucial for the development of diagnostic tools and intervention techniques to decrease the high cost to individual families and society of this disorder. In this experiment, we investigated visual system deficits in adolescents (12-21 years) diagnosed with an FASD by measuring the latency of patients' primary visual M100 responses using MEG. We hypothesized that patients with FASD would demonstrate delayed primary visual responses compared to controls. M100 latencies were assessed both for FASD patients and age-matched healthy controls for stimuli presented at the fovea (central stimulus) and at the periphery (peripheral stimuli; left or right of the central stimulus) in a saccade task requiring participants to direct their attention and gaze to these stimuli. Source modeling was performed on visual responses to the central and peripheral stimuli and the latency of the first prominent peak (M100) in the occipital source timecourse was identified. The peak latency of the M100 responses were delayed in FASD patients for both stimulus types (central and peripheral), but the difference in latency of primary visual responses to central vs. peripheral stimuli was significant only in FASD patients, indicating that, while FASD patients' visual systems are impaired in general, this impairment is more pronounced in the periphery. These results suggest that basic sensory deficits in this population may contribute to sensorimotor integration deficits described previously in this disorder. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause alterations to neurodevelopmental brain. Several studies have described difficulties in many cognitive functions and more specifically in IQ, attention and executive functions. Individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure are at increased risk for ADHD. According to the ADHD ethology, children show different cognitive and behavioral profiles. As reported, children with ADHD related to prenatal alcohol consumption show greater severity and incidence of social adjustment difficulties in comparison to idiopathic ADHD. The present study aims to assess working memory as well as behavioral problems in children with FASD/ADHD in comparison with idiopathic ADHD. METHODS: 17 adopted children diagnosed of FASD/ ADHD, age ranged between 6 and 10 years, were compared with 17 idiopathic ADHD children. Both groups were matched by the same subtype of ADHD, age and sex. Working memory was assessed using Digits, Letter and Number and Arithmetic subtests of the WISC-IV. Behavior problems were assessed using the Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist for Parents and Teachers (CBCL). RESULTS: Statistical analysis using T student shows significant differences between both groups in Digits (p <0.004), Letter and number (p <0.003) and Arithmetic (p < 0.000) WISC-IV subtest. In related to behavioral problems, we found only significant differences in social problems subscale in teacher's CBCL (p < 0,037). CONCLUSION: FASD/ADHD children tend to have more cognitive and behavioral problems compared to probable idiopathic ADHD. This profile is the one described in the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. These differences in neuropsychological profile can contribute to improve the differential diagnosis, the intervention and outcome between both groups. We recommend a routine monitoring FASD/ADHD to implement therapeutic interventions as early as possible.

N2  - Background: While much FASD research has focused on sociological, behavioural, and neuro-structural changes, prenatal alcohol exposure also results in long-term alterations in gene expression. A small but growing number of independent international research groups have begun to speculate that the mechanisms underlying the persistence of these changes are Epigenetic marks; Stable but potentially reversible alterations in gene expression that occur without changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Some epigenetic processes are linked to the chromatin (i.e., DNA, histone proteins, and other associated proteins), commonly involve chemical modifications (e.g. methylation) and operate at as on or off switches at the level of transcription, while others (e.g. miRNA) may fine-tune gene expression post-transcriptionally. Results: In our latest research publication (Laufer et al. Disease Models & Mechanisms 2013), we used four ethanol treatment protocols to model developmental ethanol exposure in mice: injections at 3 specific neurodevelopmental time points that model a "binge" exposure, and a voluntary maternal consumption model, which represents a moderate and chronic exposure throughout development. We then assessed small RNA brain gene expression in resulting adult offspring (PD 70) using miRNA expression arrays, gene expression arrays, and qPCR. The analysis revealed that a large number of microRNAs are altered, both up and down, depending on treatment paradigm. Some of these expression profiles are unique to a treatment protocol while others overlap. Strikingly, approximately 20% of the altered noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) localized to three imprinted clusters. The first two, Snrpn-Ube3a (Human 15q11-q13) and Dlk1-Dio3 (Human 14q32.2), are associated with processes involved in neuronal plasticity and several neurodevelopmental disorders that include schizophrenia, autism, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman Syndrome. Next, we assessed brain DNA methylation using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to DNA arrays (MeDIP-Chip), which revealed that even moderate fetal alcohol exposure has a genome-wide effect on DNA methylation, with PTEN/AKT/mTOR/PI3K signaling and imprinted regions of the genome appearing to be particularly sensitive. More recent results from our group have examined the hippocampal formation and confirmed brain region specificity of these results via analysis of gene expression, miRNA and snoRNA regulation, and DNA cytosine methylation. Histone modifications and trans-generational studies are a current avenue of investigation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that imprinted ncRNAs, which play critical roles in neurodevelopment and brain function, may have a role in the long-term maintenance of altered gene expression and cognitive endophenotypes associated with FASD. Discussion: Current research from our group is examining how environmental conditions; both enriched and deprived, affect disease development. This presentation will conclude with our current efforts to translate these results to create a diagnostic molecular profile in humans, which may then be used by clinical researchers to establish therapeutic attenuations, given the highly dynamic nature of epigenetic marks.

N2  - Introduction: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is characterized by Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). IUGR models show dysfunctional maternal uterine vascular adaptations. We hypothesized that chronic binge alcohol during pregnancy impairs uterine artery function via endothelialdependent mechanisms. Methods: A chronic binge alcohol paradigm was followed in the rats (peak blood alcohol concentration, 248 +/- 82.3 mg/dl, gestation day (GD) 7-17 or 19). On the day after the last alcohol exposure, uterine artery function was studied using wire myography. Alteration to endothelial function was also validated using cultured ovine uterine artery endothelial cells (GD 120-130; term = 147) with an alcohol dose and duration similar to the in vivo studies. Results: In rats, no growth deficits were observed on GD 18, whereas by GD 20 fetal body (21%, P=0.002) and placental weights (22%, P=0.001) decreased in the alcohol group. No differences in uterine artery contraction was noted in response to phenylephrine (group effect, P=0.4; logEC50, -6.02+/-0.02 vs. -5.94+/-0.03) or thromboxane (group effect, P=0.73; logEC50, -8.08+/-0.17 vs. -7.98+/-0.17). Further, alcohol did not alter endotheliumindependent SNP-induced relaxation (group effect, P=0.65; logEC50, -7.68+/-0.05 vs. -7.61+/-0.04). Alcohol selectively impaired uterine endothelium-dependent relaxation; acetylcholine significantly decreased vessel relaxation (dose and group main effect, P<0.01; logEC50, -7.02+/-0.14 vs. -6.53+/-0.35; Emax, 14%). Endothelium dysfunction was also noted in uterine endothelial cell culture system; binge alcohol decreased levels of major endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS, rate limiting enzyme for NO vasodilator production) excitatory P635eNOS/total eNOS (23%, P<0.003) compared to the Controls and the related pERK/total ERK signaling (25.7%, P<0.001). Discussion: 1) Chronic binge alcohol has detrimental effects on agonist-mediated endothelium-dependent uterine artery relaxation during pregnancy; 2) These data support that uterine vascular dysfunction precedes FASD growth deficits; 3) Chronic binge alcohol has specific effects on uterine eNOS activity and related signaling; 4) Ongoing studies will investigate role of NO, prostacyclin, and endothelium dependent hyperpolarizing factor in alcohol-induced decreases in uterine vascular function; 5) These findings suggest the involvement of the uterine compartment in FASD pathogenesis.

N2  - Alcohol exposure during pregnancy results neurodevelopmental and learning abnormalities and affects 1/100 deliveries. Neuroprotective proteins (NAP,SAL) have been shown to prevent some of the alcohol-induced sequelae including learning abnormalities and growth restriction. Previous work has demonstrated that when evaluated at 30min, 60min and 10days after exposure, phosphorylation of the JNK and p38 cell signaling pathways were affected by alcohol exposure in pregnancy. Given the acute changes in phosphorylation we sought to evaluate the impact of alcohol and NAP+SAL after 5 and 10 minutes of exposure, in cellular signaling pathways involved in stress/cell death (JNK, p38) and those that regulate cellular growth, survival and differentiation (STAT, MAP/ERK, CREB). We used the well characterized Webster mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnancy was identified by vaginal plug and treatment with alcohol, alcohol+NAP,SAL (20ug IP) or placebo(saline) were administered on gestational day 8. Embryos were harvested after 5 or 15min. Cell signaling pathways were studied using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore) and normalized to total protein concentration. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with Fishers post hoc for multiple comparisons; P<.05 significant. Prenatal alcohol exposure affects phosphorylation in the embryo at 5 and 15min with alterations in JNK in the embryo at both timepoints compared with controls (both P<0.01). Pretreatment with NAP+SAL returned levels to control at 15min. Phosphorylation of other pathways although significant at 5min, was not dramatically different, however at 15min a persistent pattern of alterations with alcohol treatment decreasing levels (all P<.01) with no improvement with the peptides, these included CREB, IL1b, p38, p70 and STAT3. Alcohol exposure stimulates the cellular signaling pathways involved in stress/cell death (JNK, p38) decreases those that regulate cellular growth, survival and differentiation. Targeting these pathways may provide an intervention for alcohol induced damage in pregnancy. (Figer Presented) .

N2  - Introduction: A cardinal feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). IUGR models show dysfunctional uterine vascular adaptations. Although alcohol has pregnancy-specific effects on both the maternal systemic & uterine endothelium, large scale quantitative proteomic studies are lacking. Objective: We utilized ITRAQ-label based method & nanoLC MS/MS to quantitate alcohol-induced alterations in the maternal uterine endothelial proteome. Methods: Uterine artery endothelial cells from pregnant ewes (Day 120-130; term=147), were FAC sorted, validated, & cultured. To mimic maternal binging patterns, 4 pairs of cell lines derived from 4 pregnant ewes were treated for 3 h on 3 days in a compensating system without or with alcohol (300 mg/dl) for 2 weeks. Lysates were TCA precipitated, solubilized, trypsin digested before addition of isobaric ITRAQ tags. Following SCX fractionation, samples were analyzed by nano LC MS/MS (MS Bioworks). Data were searched using MASCOT, quantitated & analyzed by Student's t test using Scaffold Q+. Results: Cell viability was unaltered by alcohol. Independent of treatment, a total of 363 proteins were detected with >2 unique peptides/protein & 0% false discovery rate (FDR). Of the 31 proteins significantly (P<0.05) altered by alcohol, 14 were upregulated () & 17 downregulated (). These proteins include those related to cell structure (eg. tubulin beta, P=0.002; vimentin, P<0.001), transcription & translation regulation (eg. elongation factor 1alpha, P<0.001; 40S ribosomal protein S19, P=0.002; calreticulin, P=0.004), histones (eg. H4, P<0.001; H2B-1k, P=0.036), Ca+2/nitric oxide (NO) (eg. HSP90beta, P=0.014; calmodulin, P<0.001), & redox balance (eg. thioredoxin, P=0.017). In addition to 100% FDR in these analyses, we also performed gel based 2-D Dige analysis. Conclusions: 1) This is the first study to utilize the well established ITRAQlabeled technology for proteomic analyses on any cell type in FASD field; 2) Chronic binge alcohol has specific effects on the maternal uterine vasculature at the level of the endothelial proteome; 3) The data support binge alcohol effects at multiple levels including epigenetic, transcriptional & translational; 4) Alcohol has major effects on proteins related to redox balance & Ca+2/NO regulation; & 5) These findings support a role for the uterine compartment in FASD pathogensis.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to a wide range of neurodevelopmental impairments in children and adults including behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In rhesus monkeys, we examined whether moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure would alter acoustic startle responses and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle. PPI is a highly quantifiable measure of inhibitory neural processes or sensorimotor gating associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Methods: Acoustic startle and PPI of the acoustic startle were tested in 37 adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from 4 experimental conditions: (i) moderate-level prenatal alcohol-exposed, (ii) prenatally stressed, (iii) moderate-level prenatal alcohol-exposed + prenatally stressed, and (iv) sucrose controls. Results: Prenatal alcohol-exposed monkeys showed a higher magnitude of acoustic startle response and disrupted PPI compared with monkeys not exposed to alcohol prenatally. Monkeys in all conditions showed higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis responses after undergoing the startle procedure, but HPA responses were unrelated to startle response magnitude, latency, or PPI. Conclusions: Finding altered PPI in monkeys prenatally exposed to a moderate dose of alcohol suggests that reduced sensorimotor gating is 1 effect of prenatal alcohol exposure. Because reduced sensorimotor gating is observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders, sensorimotor gating deficits could be an aspect of the comorbidity between fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and mental health conditions. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Alcohol use disorders (AUD) during pregnancy can have profound lifelong effects on the baby, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Hospital admission for AUD during pregnancy provides an opportunity for intervention. Characterization of women along the AUD spectrum during pregnancy aids the development of prevention strategies, policy, and clinical management guidelines aimed at this population. This study describes the hospital admission levels for AUD between the sixth month before pregnancy and the first year after birth and explores risk factors associated with the hospital admissions. Methods: This study was based on linked population data between 2002 and 2005 using the New South Wales (NSW) Midwives Data Collection (MDC) and the NSW Admitted Patients Data Collection (APDC), Australia. The study subjects included primiparous mothers who were admitted to hospital in the period from the sixth month before pregnancy to 1 year after birth with at least 1 of the following diagnoses (ICD-10-AM): mental and behavioral disorders due to the use of alcohol (MBDA) (F10.0-10.9); toxic effects of alcohol (T51.0-51.9); maternal care for suspected damage to fetus from alcohol (O35.4); or alcohol rehabilitation (Z50.2). Results: A total of 175 new mothers had 287 hospital admissions with the principal or stay AUD diagnoses during the study period in NSW. Of the 287 admissions, 181 admissions (63.07%) were reported for an alcohol-related disorder as the principal diagnosis. The hospital admission rate for AUD was 1.76/1,000 person-years (PY) (95% CI: 1.45 to 2.07) during the 6 months prepregnancy. The rate decreased to 0.49/1,000 PY (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.63) during pregnancy and to 0.82/1,000 PY (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.97) in the first year after birth. Women who smoked during pregnancy, lived in a remote area and were younger than 25 years, were more likely to be admitted to hospital with AUD diagnoses. Women in the middle disadvantaged quintile and born in other countries were less likely to be admitted to hospital with AUD diagnoses. Conclusions: Hospital admission for AUD decreased significantly in pregnancy and the first year postpartum compared to the prepregnancy period. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: While much FASD research has focused on sociological, behavioural, and neuro-structural changes, prenatal alcohol exposure also results in longterm alterations in gene expression. A small but growing number of independent international research groups have begun to speculate that the mechanisms underlying the persistence of these changes are Epigenetic marks; Stable but potentially reversible alterations in gene expression that occur without changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Some epigenetic processes are linked to the chromatin (i.e., DNA, histone proteins, and other associated proteins), commonly involve chemical modifications (e.g. methylation) and operate at as on or off switches at the level of transcription, while others (e.g. miRNA) may fine-tune gene expression post-transcriptionally. Results: In our latest research publication (Laufer et al. Disease Models & Mechanisms 2013), we used four ethanol treatment protocols to model developmental ethanol exposure in mice: injections at 3 specific neurodevelopmental time points that model a "binge" exposure, and a voluntary maternal consumption model, which represents a moderate and chronic exposure throughout development. We then assessed small RNA brain gene expression in resulting adult offspring (PD 70) using miRNA expression arrays, gene expression arrays, and qPCR. The analysis revealed that a large number of microRNAs are altered, both up and down, depending on treatment paradigm. Some of these expression profiles are unique to a treatment protocol while others overlap. Strikingly, approximately 20% of the altered noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) localized to three imprinted clusters. The first two, Snrpn-Ube3a (Human 15q11-q13) and Dlk1-Dio3 (Human 14q32.2), are associated with processes involved in neuronal plasticity and several neurodevelopmental disorders that include schizophrenia, autism, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman Syndrome. Next, we assessed brain DNA methylation using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to DNA arrays (MeDIP-Chip), which revealed that even moderate fetal alcohol exposure has a genome-wide effect on DNA methylation, with PTEN/AKT/mTOR/PI3K signaling and imprinted regions of the genome appearing to be particularly sensitive. More recent results from our group have examined the hippocampal formation and confirmed brain region specificity of these results via analysis of gene expression, miRNA and snoRNA regulation, and DNA cytosine methylation. Histone modifications and trans-generational studies are a current avenue of investigation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that imprinted ncRNAs, which play critical roles in neurodevelopment and brain function, may have a role in the long-term maintenance of altered gene expression and cognitive endophenotypes associated with FASD. Discussion: Current research from our group is examining how environmental conditions; both enriched and deprived, affect disease development. This presentation will conclude with our current efforts to translate these results to create a diagnostic molecular profile in humans, which may then be used by clinical researchers to establish therapeutic attenuations, given the highly dynamic nature of epigenetic marks.

N2  - Background: The Lililwan Project is the first population-based study to determine Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) prevalence in Australia and was conducted in the remote Fitzroy Valley in North Western Australia. The diagnostic process for FASD requires accurate assessment of gross and fine motor functioning using standardised cut-offs for impairment. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2) is a norm-referenced assessment of motor function used worldwide and in FASD clinics in North America. It is available in a Complete Form with 53 items or a Short Form with 14 items. Its reliability in measuring motor performance in children exposed to alcohol in utero or living in remote Australian Aboriginal communities is unknown.Methods: A prospective inter-rater and test-retest reliability study was conducted using the BOT-2 Short Form. A convenience sample of children (n = 30) aged 7 to 9 years participating in the Lililwan Project cohort (n = 108) study, completed the reliability study. Over 50% of mothers of Lililwan Project children drank alcohol during pregnancy. Two raters simultaneously scoring each child determined inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was determined by assessing each child on a second occasion using predominantly the same rater. Reliability was analysed by calculating Intra-Class correlation Coefficients, ICC(2,1), Percentage Exact Agreement (PEA) and Percentage Close Agreement (PCA) and measures of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were calculated.Results: Thirty Aboriginal children (18 male, 12 female: mean age 8.8 years) were assessed at eight remote Fitzroy Valley communities. The inter-rater reliability for the BOT-2 Short Form score sheet outcomes ranged from 0.88 (95%CI, 0.77 - 0.94) to 0.92 (95%CI, 0.84 - 0.96) indicating excellent reliability. The test-retest reliability (median interval between tests being 45.5 days) for the BOT-2 Short Form score sheet outcomes ranged from 0.62 (95%CI, 0.34 - 0.80) to 0.73 (95%CI, 0.50 - 0.86) indicating fair to good reliability. The raw score MDC was 6.12.Conclusion: The BOT-2 Short Form has acceptable reliability for use in remote Australian Aboriginal communities and will be useful in determining motor deficits in children exposed to alcohol prenatally. This is the first known study evaluating the reliability of the BOT-2 Short Form, either in the context of assessment for FASD or in Aboriginal children. © 2013 Lucas et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Brief, effective interventions are needed to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy in women who drink and do not use effective contraception. The Healthy Choices study compared telephone and in-person administration of a brief intervention. In addition to indicators of alcohol use and effective contraception, compliance with the intervention was examined. Women between the ages of 18 and 44 who were drinking above recommended levels and not using effective contraception were randomly assigned to either a telephone (n= 68) or in-person (n= 63) brief (two sessions) intervention. Overall, participants showed small but significant reductions in alcohol use and larger increases in effective use of contraception. Risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancy was thus significantly reduced, largely due to improved contraception with minor reductions in alcohol use. There was no significant difference in success of the intervention between the two conditions (telephone versus in-person). These findings suggest telephone-based brief intervention may be equally successful and cost-effective in reducing the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy and thus fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2013.

N2  - The failure of education to significantly reduce the incidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome has made it important to understand the mechanisms in order to develop preventative or ameliorative strategies. Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to be associated with altered fetal blood flow, oxidative stress and growth restriction that can persist into adolescence. Low birth weight is also associated with altered development and programming which can have lifelong consequences. Glutamine has been linked with fetal nitrogen and carbon metabolism, synthesis of the cellular anti-oxidant glutathione, and apoptosis suppression. It is a precursor for the synthesis of other amino acids, endothelial-dependent relaxation, and increases in protein synthesis and is used clinically as a nutrient supplement in low birth weight infants. We hypothesized that chronic third trimester-equivalent prenatal alcohol exposure would decrease the bioavailability of amino acids, hamper fetal body growth, increase fetal cerebellar oxidative stress, and alter fetal blood flow; a corollary hypothesis was that maternal L-glutamine supplementation may improve these negative developmental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to 4 groups: saline control, glutamine (GLN) control, alcohol or alcohol + GLN. Alcohol or saline infusions were given intravenously (IV) over 1 h from gestation day (GD) 109 to 132 or from GD99 to 121, 3 consecutive days per week to mimic a weekend binge drinking pattern. 100 mg/kg of GLN dose was administered IV as a 4.5 %w/v aqueous bolus three times a day. Third trimester equivalent prenatal alcohol exposure reduced fetal weight and height and also increased the ponderal index compared to the control group; these parameters were significantly improved in the alcohol + GLN group compared to the alcohol group. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreased fetal plasma concentrations of arginine, aspartate, glutamine, taurine and tyrosine; maternal glutamine supplementation improved the bioavailability of amino acids in both the maternal and fetal compartments. We observed a decrease in oxidized glutathione in maternal hemocytes and the fetal cerebellum for the alcohol + GLN group compared to the alcohol group. Fetal cerebellar blood flow was significantly increased in the alcohol group, hence increasing the cerebellar alcohol delivery. This alcohol-induced increase in fetal cerebellar blood flow was mitigated in the alcohol + GLN group. In summary, maternal glutamine supplementation improved amino acid bioavailability, fetal growth and endogenous antioxidant levels in alcohol exposed fetuses. Thus, glutamine shows great potential as a therapeutic or intervention strategy for the negative effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is a major, preventable cause of neurobehavioral dysfunction in children worldwide. The measurement and quantification of saccadic eye movements is a powerful tool for assessing sensory, motor, and cognitive function. The quality of the motor process of an eye movement is known as saccade metrics. Saccade accuracy is 1 component of metrics, which to function optimally requires several cortical brain structures as well as an intact cerebellum and brain-stem. The cerebellum has frequently been reported to be damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. This study, therefore, tested the hypothesis that children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) will exhibit deficits in the accuracy of saccades. Methods: A group of children with FASD (n = 27) between the ages of 8 and 16 and typically developing control children (n = 27) matched for age and sex, completed 3 saccadic eye movement tasks of increasing difficulty. Eye movement performance during the tasks was captured using an infrared eye tracker. Saccade metrics (e.g., velocity, amplitude, accuracy) were quantified and compared between the 2 groups for the 3 different tasks. Results: Children with FASD were more variable in saccade endpoint accuracy, which was reflected by statistically significant increases in the error of the initial saccade endpoint and the frequency of additional, corrective saccades required to achieve final fixation. This increased variability in accuracy was amplified when the cognitive demand of the tasks increased. Children with FASD also displayed a statistically significant increase in response inhibition errors. Conclusions: These data suggest that children with FASD may have deficits in eye movement control and sensory-motor integration including cerebellar circuits, thereby impairing saccade accuracy. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Early identification of and intervention for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has been shown to optimize outcomes for affected individuals. Detecting biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in neonates may assist in the identification of children at risk of FASD enabling targeted early interventions. Despite these potential benefits, complicated ethical issues arise in screening for biomarkers of PAE and these must be addressed prior to the implementation of screening programs. Here, we identify and comment, based on a North American perspective, on concerns raised in the current ethical, social, and legal literature related to meconium screening for PAE. Major ethical concerns revolve around the targeting of populations for PAE screening, consent and respect for persons, stigma and participation rates, the cost-benefit analysis of a screening program, consequences of false-positive and false-negative test results, confidentiality and appropriate follow-up to positive screen results, and the use of screen results for criminal prosecution. We identify gaps in the literature on screening for PAE, most notably related to a lack of stakeholder perspectives (e.g., parents, healthcare providers) about screening and the ethical challenges it presents. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, can result in craniofacial dysmorphism, cognitive impairment, sensory and motor disabilities among other defects. FASD incidences are as high as 2% to 5 % children born in the US, and prevalence is higher in low socioeconomic populations. Despite various mechanisms being proposed to explain the etiology of FASD, the molecular targets of ethanol toxicity during development are unknown. Proposed mechanisms include cell death, cell signaling defects and gene expression changes. More recently, the involvement of several other molecular pathways was explored, including non-coding RNA, epigenetic changes and specific vitamin deficiencies. These various pathways may interact, producing a wide spectrum of consequences. Detailed understanding of these various pathways and their interactions will facilitate the therapeutic target identification, leading to new clinical intervention, which may reduce the incidence and severity of these highly prevalent preventable birth defects. This review discusses manifestations of alcohol exposure on the developing central nervous system, including the neural crest cells and sensory neural placodes, focusing on molecular neurodevelopmental pathways as possible therapeutic targets for prevention or protection. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Alcohol is a known teratogen that is estimated to affect 2-5% of the births in the U.S. Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce physical features such as facial dysmorphology, physiological alterations such as cell loss in the central nervous system (CNS), and behavioral changes that include hyperactivity, cognitive deficits, and motor dysfunction. The range of effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure is referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Despite preventative measures, some women continue to drink while pregnant. Therefore, identifying interventions that reduce the severity of FASD is critical. This study investigated one such potential intervention, vitamin D3, a nutrient that exerts neuroprotective properties. The present study determined whether cholecalciferol, a common vitamin D3 nutritional supplement, could serve as a means of mitigating alcohol-related learning deficits. Using a rat model of FASD, cholecalciferol was given before, during, and after 3rd trimester equivalent alcohol exposure. Three weeks after cholecalciferol treatment, subjects were tested on a serial spatial discrimination reversal learning task. Animals exposed to ethanol committed significantly more errors compared to controls. Cholecalciferol treatment reduced perseverative behavior that is associated with developmental alcohol exposure in a dose-dependent manner. These data have important implications for the treatment of FASD and suggest that cholecalciferol may reduce some aspects of FASD. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: Chronic prenatal alcohol exposure can injure the developing brain, and is associated with a variety of physiological and behavioural postnatal anomalies, collectively referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Included among the anomalies is a markedly increased prevalence of seizures. To date, there exists limited information regarding the underlying mechanisms. The hippocampus is a structure implicated in the FASD and is a source of seizure activity in a variety of epileptic conditions. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in mice on the physiology and seizure susceptibility of the hippocampus. Method: Pregnant mice received 10% v/v ethanol for the first trimester of gestation by voluntary consumption. Extracellular field potentials were recorded from the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions using acute brain slices prepared from control and ethanol-exposed pups of age PD 15 to PD 21. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure for the first trimester resulted in an increase of spontaneous field activity in both the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions. These spontaneous discharges consist of depolarizing shifts of 0.2-1 mV in amplitude and 30-150 ms in duration, which were blocked by the addition of the gap junctional communication antagonist, carbenoxolone. Furthermore, prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in an increase in spontaneous and recurrent seizures in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions. Along with the physiological changes we observed molecular changes in FASD mice, including up-regulation of connexin 30 mRNA and connexin 30 protein compared to age-matched controls. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that exposure of the developing brain to alcohol results in abnormal physiological and molecular changes and an increase in seizure susceptibility in the hippocampus.

N2  - Presentation A 32-year-old woman booked her second pregnancy at the local district hospital. Her first pregnancy and delivery were unremarkable. Investigation The anomaly scan was undertaken at 20 weeks and 2 days, where all measurements were found to be on the fifth centile. A referral was made to the Consultant Obstetrician, and serial scans demonstrated the growth velocity to be maintained on the fifth centile, but the head circumference well below the third centile at 21, 23 and 26 week scans. Uterine dopplers were normal, as were liquor volume and umbilical dopplers. A fetal echocardiogram was performed. An amniocentesis was normal. A fetal brain MRI was undertaken at 28 weeks, which demonstrated delayed sulcation and a small brain. After counselling, the couple opted for a fetocide, followed by induction at 33 weeks, and a male infant was born weighing 1075 g and head circumference of 25 cm. A minimally invasive postmortem revealed normal development, other than isolated microcephaly with an immature brain for gestational age, of undetermined aetiology. Discussion Microcephaly is defined when the head circumference is measured to be smaller than expected for gestational age. The threshold at which diagnosis is made varies between authors; it is usually defined as a head perimeter measurement of -3 SD or less below the mean. Minus 2 SD is also sometimes used but will incorporate a proportion of fetuses with a small head circumference but normal development. It is primarily a disorder of cell proliferation in the cortex rather than the bones of the cranium. The forebrain is most affected and there can be other associated abnormalities including asymmetries and atrophy of the basal ganglia. The diagnosis is primarily pathogenetic. Once the diagnosis has been made, other abnormalities are sought as microcephaly may exist as part of a syndrome or an isolated finding. The causes of microcephaly include chromosomal abberations and gene defects, the result of infection (such as rubella, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis) and environmental toxins including fetal alcohol syndrome. A family history of microcephaly or other possible genetic syndromes should be taken, along with a history of exposure to viral illness and alcohol consumption. Conclusion Diagnosis on ultrasound can be challenging, and accurate gestational age is required. Head perimeter is used, and the cranial vault appears small compared with the facial bones. The forehead may have a sloping appearance. Dilated lateral ventricles can also suggest microcephaly in the context of borderline head perimeter.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Objective: To investigate the relationship between maternal alcohol-use disorder and dental hospital admissions in children up to 5 years of age. Study design: Mothers with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision/10th revision alcohol-related diagnosis, a proxy for alcohol-use disorder, were identified through the Western Australian data-linkage system. Exposed mothers were frequency-matched by maternal age, Aboriginal status, and child's birth year to randomly selected comparison mothers without an alcohol diagnosis. Linkage with the Midwives Notification System (1983-2002) identified all births of these mothers; "exposed" (non-Aboriginal, n = 11 171; Aboriginal, n = 8145) and comparison cohorts (non-Aboriginal, n = 32 508; Aboriginal, n = 16 719). Dental hospital admissions were identified through linkage with Hospital Morbidity Data (1983-2007) (3.2% exposed; 3.0% comparison) and cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (n = 84) through linkage with the Western Australian Register of Developmental Anomalies. ORs and 95% CIs for having a dental admission (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision: 520-529; International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision: K0-K14.9) were generated by the use of generalized estimating equations, which we adjusted for potential confounding factors (aOR). Results: Children of mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis had increased adjusted odds of gingivitis and periodontal diseases (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.12-2.51) and "other" diseases of the lip and oral mucosa (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.21-2.01). Diseases of the salivary glands were increased only in Aboriginal children of mothers with an alcohol-related diagnosis (aOR 2.65; 95% CI 1.09-6.44). Children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome had increased ORs of any dental admission (aOR 2.58; 95% CI 1.30-5.11). Conclusions: Maternal alcohol-use disorder was associated with dental admissions related to disorders of the soft tissues, but questions remain regarding perinatal influences on dental admissions and disease.

N2  - Aims: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a very common and completely avoidable disease caused by intrauterine alcohol exposition. FAS has severe consequences not only for the individual and its direct environment but also for the health and social system in Germany. The first aim of the project is the determination of evidence-based, clinically relevant and implementable diagnostic criteria for the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome in children and adolescents in Germany. With help of the defined diagnostic criteria of FAS the disorder can be diagnosed and treated earlier, so secondary disorders can be reduced. The second aim is to create awareness in the German society about the severe complications of alcohol use in pregnancy in order to reduce the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and diminish the incidence of FAS. Methods: A steering group in Munich and a consensus group consisting of representatives of the German Federal Ministry of Health, the German Professional Societies and other FAS experts have been established in 2011. Representatives of the Patient Support Group FASworld are also members of the consensus group. For the methodological guidance the AWMF (Consortium of the scientific medical societies) is responsible and the literature evaluation is conducted by the AZQ (Center for Quality in Medicine). Results: The consensus group defined a key question and specific issues for the literature search. The evaluation of the literature is in progress. The methodological quality of the international and especially the German publications about the diagnostic criteria are rather poor. Most of the existing international guidelines for the diagnosis of FAS are consensus- but not evidence-based. Conclusion: There is great need for a standardized, multidisciplinary, quality assured and implementable prevention of FAS in Germany. The first step is the establishment of evidence- and consensus-based diagnostic criteria for children with FAS which will be approved and presented in 2012.

N2  - Alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) are the direct cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). This study examines drinking patterns among pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing age in Russia, a country with one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world. Cross-sectional survey. Seven public women's clinics in two locations: St Petersburg (SPB) and the Nizhny Novgorod region (NNR). A total of 648 pregnant and non-pregnant childbearing-age women. A face-to-face structured interview assessed alcohol consumption, pregnancy status/possibility of becoming pregnant and consumption before and after pregnancy recognition. Eighty-nine per cent of non-pregnant women reported consuming alcohol and 65% reported binge drinking in the past 3 months; 47% in NNR and 28% in SPB reported binges at least monthly. Women who might become pregnant consumed alcohol similarly to women who were not likely to become pregnant, and 32% of women in SPB and 54% in NNR were categorized as at risk for AEP. There was a significant decline in drinking after pregnancy identification. Twenty per cent of pregnant women reported consuming alcohol and 6% in SBP (none in NNR) reported binge drinking; however, a high prevalence of binge drinking was found among women who might become pregnant or who were trying to conceive. Russian women substantially reduce drinking after pregnancy recognition compared to pre-pregnancy levels. No reductions were found prior to pregnancy recognition, either when a woman might become pregnant or when she was trying to conceive. The pre-conception period presents a risk window and, therefore, a prevention opportunity. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.

N2  - Human birth defects are highly variable and this phenotypic variability can be influenced by both the environment and genetics. However, the synergistic interactions between these two variables are not well understood. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is the umbrella term used to describe the wide range of deleterious outcomes following prenatal alcohol exposure. Although FASD are caused by prenatal ethanol exposure, FASD are thought to be genetically modulated, although the genes regulating sensitivity to ethanol teratogenesis are largely unknown. To identify potential ethanol-sensitive genes, we tested five known craniofacial mutants for ethanol sensitivity: cyp26b1, gata3, pdgfra, smad5 and smoothened. We found that only platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (pdgfra) interacted with ethanol during zebrafish craniofacial development. Analysis of the PDGF family in a human FASD genome-wide dataset links PDGFRA to craniofacial phenotypes in FASD, prompting a mechanistic understanding of this interaction. In zebrafish, untreated pdgfra mutants have cleft palate due to defective neural crest cell migration, whereas pdgfra heterozygotes develop normally. Ethanol-exposed pdgfra mutants have profound craniofacial defects that include the loss of the palatal skeleton and hypoplasia of the pharyngeal skeleton. Furthermore, ethanol treatment revealed latent haploinsufficiency, causing palatal defects in ~62% of pdgfra heterozygotes. Neural crest apoptosis partially underlies these ethanol-induced defects in pdgfra mutants, demonstrating a protective role for Pdgfra. This protective role is mediated by the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Collectively, our results suggest a model where combined genetic and environmental inhibition of PI3K/mTOR signaling leads to variability within FASD. © 2013.

T1  - A potential molecular target for morphological defects of fetal alcohol syndrome: Kir2.1
A1  - Bates E.A.
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a developmental disorder that affects up to 0.2% of births. FASD comprises severe cognitive and structural birth defects including cleft lip/palate, small jaw, wide-set eyes, dental abnormalities, digit abnormalities, small head, and short stature. Strict counseling guidelines stress abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy, but the prevalence of FASD persists. The lack of a convincing molecular target has hindered FASD research and treatment. Interestingly, mutations in an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1, cause a similar constellation of birth defects as in FASD. In other words, FASD phenocopies the traits conveyed by Kir2.1 mutations. Furthermore, alcohol directly binds to and modulates Kir2.1. Substantial evidence now suggests that alcohol targets Kir2.1 to cause the birth defects associated with FASD. This review compiles clinical, genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological, and molecular evidence that identifies Kir2.1 as a molecular target for FASD development and possibly therapeutic treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - A derived peptide from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) has been shown to be neuroprotective in the fetal alcohol exposure model. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 against alcohol-induced apoptosis using TUNEL staining. We further characterize in this study the proteomic architecture underlying the role of ADNF-9 against ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic days 7-13 (E7-E13) to a 25% ethanol-derived calorie [25% EDC, Alcohol (ALC)] diet, a 25% EDC diet simultaneously administered i.p. ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9), or a pair-fed (PF) liquid diet. At E13, fetal brains were collected from 5 dams from each group, weighed, and frozen for LC-MS/MS procedure. Other fetal brains were fixed for TUNEL staining. Administration of ADNF-9 prevented alcohol-induced reduction in fetal brain weight and alcohol-induced increases in cell death. Moreover, individual fetal brains were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Statistical differences in the amounts of proteins between the ALC and ALC/ADNF-9 groups resulted in a distinct data-clustering. Significant upregulation of several important proteins involved in brain development were found in the ALC/ADNF-9 group as compared to the ALC group. These findings provide information on potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 in the fetal alcohol exposure model.

N2  - Although children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure may exhibit the distinctive facial dysmorphology seen in full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), many lack that dysmorphology. This study examined the functional organization of working memory in the brain in three groups of children-those meeting diagnostic criteria for FAS or PFAS, heavily exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children, and healthy controls. A verbal n-back task (1-back and 0-back) was administered to 47 children (17 with FAS/PFAS, 13 HE, and 17 controls) during fMRI. Intra-group one-sample t-tests were used to identify activity regions of interest central to verbal working memory including the dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC), inferior frontal gyrus, caudate/putamen, parietal cortex, and cerebellar Crus I/lobule VI and lobule VIIB-IX. Whereas groups did not differ in task sensitivity, fMRI analyses suggested different patterns of sub-network recruitment across groups. Controls primarily recruited left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). By contrast, HE primarily recruited an extensive set of fronto-striatal regions, including left dPFC and left caudate, and the FAS/PFAS group relied primarily on two cerebellar subregions and parietal cortex. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate differential recruitment of critical brain regions that subserve basic function in children with different fetal alcohol spectrum disorders compared to controls. The distinct activation patterns seen in the two exposed groups may be related to substantial differences in alcohol dose/occasion to which these groups were exposed in utero.

N2  - High numbers of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) have been described as having mental health problems. This article summarizes research about mental health problems in FASD and considers related developmental and environmental issues. A computer-based literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Academic Search Complete, and Education Resources Information Centre for articles addressing the prevalence and types of mental health issues in individuals affected by FASD. High rates of mental disorders within the FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) population were found to be consistently reported for both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Moreover, problems that emerge in childhood may reflect a convergence of genetic, environmental, and neurophysiological factors that persist into adulthood. Researchers are beginning to document the impacts of PAE on later mental health development. Further longitudinal study is needed to determine whether there is an increasing severity of mental health deficits and consequences with age, and whether any such changes reflect increasingly deteriorating environmental factors or brain-based factors. Additionally, research is needed to design interventions to better address the unique mental health needs of this population.

N2  - Craniofacial bone dysmorphology is an important but under-explored potential diagnostic feature of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. This study used longitudinal MicroCT 3D imaging to examine the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on craniofacial bone growth in a mouse model. C57BL/6J dams were divided into 3 groups: alcohol 4.2% v/v in PMI liquid diet (ALC), 2 weeks prior to and during pregnancy from embryonic (E) days 7-E16; pair-fed controls (PF), isocalorically matched to the ALC group; chow controls (CHOW), given ad libitum chow and water. The MicroCT scans were performed on pups on postnatal days 7 (P7) and P21. The volumes of the neurocranium (volume encased by the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones) and the viscerocranium (volume encased by the mandible and nasal bone), along with total skull bone volume, head size, and head circumference were evaluated using general linear models and discriminant analyses. The pups in the alcohol-treated group, when compared to the chow-fed controls (ALC vs CHOW) and the isocaloric-fed controls (ALC vs PF), showed differences in head size and circumference at P7 and P21, the total skull volume and parietal bone volume at P7, and volume of all the tested bones except nasal at P21. There was a growth trend of ALC<CHOW and ALC
CHOW), and the total skull, parietal bone, and occipital bone at P21 (ALC<CHOW, ALC<PF). While covarying for the P7 measures, the treatment affected only the 3 neurocranial bones at P21 (ALC<CHOW, ALC<PF). Discriminant analysis sensitively selected between ALC and CHOW (AUC=0.967), between ALC and PF (AUC=0.995), and between PF and CHOW (AUC=0.805). These results supported our hypothesis that craniofacial bones might be a reliable and sensitive indicator for the diagnosis of prenatal alcohol exposure. Significantly, we found that the neurocranium (upper skull) was more sensitive to alcohol than the viscerocranium (face). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: During late prenatal and early postnatal life, the reproductive system in males undergoes an extensive series of physiological and morphological changes. Prenatal ethanol (EtOH) exposure has marked effects on the development of the reproductive system, with long-term effects on function in adulthood. The present study tested the hypothesis that prenatal EtOH exposure will delay the onset of spermatogenesis. Methods: Development of the seminiferous tubules and the onset of spermatogenesis were examined utilizing a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Male offspring from ad libitum-fed control (C), pair-fed (PF), and EtOH-fed (prenatal alcohol exposure [PAE]) dams were terminated on postnatal (PN) days 5, 15, 18, 20, 25, 35, 45, and 55, to investigate morphological changes through morphometric analysis of the testes from early neonatal life through young adulthood. Results: PAE males had lower relative (adjusted for body weight) testis weights compared with PF and/or C males from PN15 through puberty (PN45). In addition, fewer gonocytes (primordial germ cells) were located on the basal lamina on PN5, while more of those touching the basal lamina were dividing in PAE compared with PF and C males, suggesting delayed cell division and migration processes. As well, the percentage of tubules with open lumena was lower in PAE compared with PF and C males on PN18 and 20, and PAE males had fewer primary spermatocytes per tubule on PN18 and round spermatids per tubule on PN25 compared with C males. Finally, the percentage of tubules at stages VII and VIII, when mature spermatids move to the apex of the epithelium and are released, was lower in PAE compared with PF and/or C males in young adulthood (PN55). Conclusions: Maternal EtOH consumption appears to delay both reproductive development and the onset of spermatogenesis in male offspring, with effects persisting at least until young adulthood. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - We explored differences in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors across six groups of professionals in key position to provide primary and secondary prevention efforts (physicians, educators, correctional staff, social workers, public health nurses, and substance abuse counselors). Achieving a 60.1% response rate, 2,292 professionals returned surveys, providing data on basic knowledge of FAS, FASD-associated risks and cognitive deficits, and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women. Across groups, findings revealed ample FASD knowledge and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women that increases as consumption becomes more frequent and severe. However, results revealed significant between-group differences data that provide valuable guidance for targeted future FASD education efforts. Public health initiatives regarding FASD have been effective in increasing knowledge among a broad range of professionals. However, between-group differences indicate the need for targeted, discipline-specific interventions. These differences highlight the need for all professional groups to provide a consistent public health message regarding maternal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Jones et al in 1973 described the prenatal alcohol exposure and the correlation with facial malformations, growth restriction, cognitive and behavioral problems as the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). But the first time that the correlation of the pregnant woman with alcohol consumption and the bad infant outcome referred was by Aristotles 2.350 years ago. Alcohol consumption had increased in the contemporary world. In USA 7.6% of the pregnant women drink alcohol during pregnancy. In Europe the problem is worst, especially in northern countries that 1% pregnant women are heavy addicted with alcohol. 25-50% of the women who drink alcohol continued alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In our country, in a very recent study, Karavitakis and al found that 20% of the Cretan pregnant women consume alcohol. The 13% had mild consumption (1 standard drink, 1 time/week). The women who drink alcohol in this study were the most educated, with the higher income and older age. From the above it is obvious that FAS is not uncommon and May et al considered an incidence of 0.2-2 per 1000 live births. In order to describe the large range of adverse outcomes, they proposed the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Stratton et al in 1996 defined the 5 diagnostic categories of FASD. These are, FAS with confirmed or not alcohol exposure, partial FAS with confirmed alcohol exposure, alcohol related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). The accurate history of prenatal exposure to alcohol is the main and crucial issue for the diagnosis of the FASD, but this is not always possible. The existing biomarkers as the levels of fatty acid ethyl esters in meconium and hair are difficult to be utilized in the clinical practice. The most common phenotype at birth includes low centile of OFC and BW and withdrawal symptoms. During infancy and early childhood, facial deformities (thin upper lip, short palpebral fissures, disappearance of lip philtrum, epicanthic folds, clinodactyly, nail hypoplasia), microcefaly, growth failure, intellectual disability, behavior problems and speech difficulties, were presented. Chromosomal imbalances may have similar to FASD phenotypes. So it is important the role of clinical geneticist in these cases. Fanconi anaemia, Smith-Lemi-Opitz syndrome, Stickler syndrome, Kabuki syndrome, Turner syndrome, has features which overlap with FASD. Chromosomal microarray analysis is useful to identify alternative diagnosis with similar phenotype as 22q11 deletions, which occurs of around 1 in 8000. Alcohol can damage a fetus at any stage of pregnancy. Damage can occur in the earlier weeks of pregnancy even before a woman knows that she is pregnant, and that time the fetus is particularly susceptible to alcohol exposure due to organogenesis,. Conclusions: No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered as safe during pregnancy. Even low amounts of alcohol during early pregnancy increases, the risk of spontaneous abortion substantially. For all these reasons a pregnant woman should not drink alcohol during pregnancy.

N2  - Ethanol consumption during pregnancy is a widespread problem which is increasing in the generation of young women. Gestational alcohol consumption causes fetal exposure to this teratogen and is associated with the onset of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FASD and FAS can lead to several physical, cognitive and behavioral disabilities, whose early diagnosis is of primary importance to perform primary prevention with total abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and secondary prevention in newborns and children for a proper follow up to reduce risk of secondary consequences. In recent years significant efforts have been made to understand the underlying mechanisms of this disease and to identify objective biological and instrumental diagnostic tools, such as exposure biomarkers in neonatal meconium and advanced magnetic resonance imaging. Nonetheless, further studies are still needed to implement our knowledge on fetal effects of ethanol, and multidisciplinary actions are necessary to raise awareness among women of childbearing age about the danger of consuming even small amounts of ethanol during pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The study investigated prenatal alcohol consumption and knowledge of alcohol risks and fetal alcohol syndrome among Korean women. The participants were 221 Korean women who attended the post-partum care centers in Seoul, Korea. The data included the participants' background characteristics, quantity-frequency typology, Student Alcohol Questionnaire, and a scale on the participants' knowledge of fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol was consumed during pregnancy by 12.7% of the participants. Of these, 60.7% drank alcohol with their spouse. A few participants reported that nurses identified their drinking habits and gave them information on alcohol consumption and fetal alcohol syndrome. Most of the participants did not have the opportunity for prenatal counseling about fetal alcohol syndrome. The knowledge level regarding alcohol risks and fetal alcohol syndrome among the participants was poor. Alcohol consumption before pregnancy was significantly related to prenatal alcohol consumption. Prenatal alcohol consumption was not related to knowledge about alcohol consumption and fetal alcohol syndrome. The assessment of alcohol consumption and counseling about alcohol are needed for pregnant women in order to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

N2  - The highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome worldwide can be found in South Africa. Particularly in impoverished townships in the Western Cape, pregnant women live in environments where alcohol intake during pregnancy has become normalized and interpersonal violence (IPV) is reported at high rates. For the current study we sought to examine how pregnancy, for both men and women, is related to alcohol use behaviors and IPV. We surveyed 2,120 men and women attending drinking establishments in a township located in the Western Cape of South Africa. Among women 13.3% reported being pregnant, and among men 12.0% reported their partner pregnant. For pregnant women, 61% reported attending the bar that evening to drink alcohol and 26% reported both alcohol use and currently experiencing IPV. Daily or almost daily binge drinking was reported twice as often among pregnant women than non-pregnant women (8.4% vs. 4.2%). Men with pregnant partners reported the highest rates of hitting sex partners, forcing a partner to have sex, and being forced to have sex. High rates of alcohol frequency, consumption, binge drinking, consumption and binge drinking were reported across the entire sample. In general, experiencing and perpetrating IPV were associated with alcohol use among all participants except for men with pregnant partners. Alcohol use among pregnant women attending shebeens is alarmingly high. Moreover, alcohol use appears to be an important factor in understanding the relationship between IPV and pregnancy. Intensive, targeted, and effective interventions for both men and women are urgently needed to address high rates of drinking alcohol among pregnant women who attend drinking establishments.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can alter physical and behavioral development, leading to a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Despite warning labels, pregnant women continue to drink alcohol, creating a need to identify effective interventions to reduce the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects. Choline is an essential nutrient that influences brain and behavioral development. Recent studies indicate that choline supplementation can reduce the teratogenic effects of developmental alcohol exposure. The present study examined whether choline supplementation during prenatal ethanol treatment could mitigate the adverse effects of ethanol on behavioral development. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated with 6 g/kg/day ethanol in a binge-like manner from gestational days 5-20; pair-fed and ad libitum chow controls were included. During treatment, subjects from each group were intubated with either 250 mg/kg/day choline chloride or vehicle. Spontaneous alternation, parallel bar motor coordination, Morris water maze, and spatial working memory were assessed in male and female offspring. Subjects prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibited delayed development of spontaneous alternation behavior and deficits on the working memory version of the Morris water maze during adulthood, effects that were mitigated with prenatal choline supplementation. Neither alcohol nor choline influenced performance on the motor coordination task. These data indicate that choline supplementation during prenatal alcohol exposure may reduce the severity of fetal alcohol effects, particularly on alterations in tasks that require behavioral flexibility. These findings have important implications for children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Alcohol exposure in pregnancy is a common and modifiable risk factor for poor pregnancy and child outcomes. Alcohol exposure in pregnancy can cause a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems in the child including the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). In order to improve prevention strategies, we sought to describe the knowledge and attitudes of women of childbearing age regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus. We conducted a national cross-sectional survey via computer assisted telephone interview of 1103 Australian women aged 18 to 45 years. Participants were randomly selected from the Electronic White Pages. Pregnant women were not eligible to participate. Quotas were set for age groups and a minimum of 100 participants per state to ensure a national sample reflecting the population. The questionnaire was based on a Health Canada survey with additional questions constructed by the investigators. Descriptive statistics were calculated and logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations with participants' knowledge and attitudes. Of women surveyed, 61.5% had heard about effects of alcohol on the fetus and 55.3% had heard of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Although 92.7% agreed alcohol can affect the unborn child, 16.2% did not agree that the disabilities could be lifelong. Most women agreed that pregnant women should not drink alcohol (80.2%) and 79.2% reported having negative feelings towards pregnant women drinking alcohol. Women with higher education levels were more likely to know the effects of alcohol consumption in pregnancy (adjusted OR 5.62; 95% CI 3.20 to 9.87) but education level and knowledge were not associated with attitude. There was a disjunction between knowledge and attitudes towards alcohol consumption in pregnancy. These findings will assist in developing effective health promotion campaigns to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and subsequent fetal damage.

N2  - Psychological distress (PD) includes symptoms of depression and anxiety and is associated with considerable emotional suffering, social dysfunction and, often, with problematic alcohol use. The rate of current PD among American Indian women is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of U.S. women in general. Our study aims to fill the current knowledge gap about the prevalence and characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems among American Indian mothers whose children were referred to screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data was conducted from maternal interviews of referred American Indian mothers (n = 152) and a comparison group of mothers (n = 33) from the same Plains culture tribes who participated in an NIAAA-funded epidemiology study of FASD. Referred women were from one of six Plains Indian reservation communities and one urban area who bore children suspected of having an FASD. A 6-item PD scale (PD-6, Cronbach's alpha = .86) was constructed with a summed score range of 0-12 and a cut-point of 7 indicating serious PD. Multiple statistical tests were used to examine the characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems. Referred and comparison mothers had an average age of 31.3 years but differed (respectively) on: education (<high school: 47.4%, 9.1%), PD-6 mean scores (3.57, 1.48), current prevalence of serious PD (19.1%, 0.0%), and a current drinking problem (31.6%, 12.1%). Among referred mothers, those with a current drinking problem had a significantly higher mean PD-6 score. Having PD, serious PD, and 2 specific scale items significantly increased the odds that a referred mother would have a current drinking problem. Psychological distress among referred mothers is significantly associated with having a self-reported drinking problem. FASD prevention requires multi-level prevention efforts that provide real opportunities for educational attainment and screening and monitoring of PD and alcohol use during the childbearing years. Mixed methods studies are needed to illuminate the social and cultural determinants at the base of the experience of PD and to identify the strengths and protective factors of unaffected peers who reside within the same communities.

N2  - In the last 40 years a vast mass of clinical, epidemiological and experimental evidence has demonstrated that alcohol is a teratogenic agent and that its consumption during gestation can cause foetal death, malformations and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in the exposed fetus. The most dramatic presentation is the complete foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is observed in children born from heavy alcohol consuming mothers. FAS and of other fetal alcohol-related effects was reported in both USA and Europe in the middle 80 s. However, despite these evidences, many European countries have largely forgotten or minimize the risks associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. Thirty years later, new epidemiological and clinical studies as well as new biomarkers of fetal-alcohol damage have identified high risk populations and have provided data demonstrating that significant number of women in the EU drink during pregnancy. In September of 2009, a conference on 'ALCOHOL AND PREGNANCY' was organized sponsored by the Swedish Presidency of the European Union, to discuss political interventions in the EU concerning this question. I briefly summarize here the discussions, presentations and the prevention programs of some European countries. The main conclusion of the conference was that we need more information and prevention programs to improve prevention of the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption during gestation.

N2  - Background: A battery of clinical assessments was used in the Lililwan* Project, Australia's first population-based Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) prevalence study, conducted in the remote Fitzroy Valley, Western Australia. One objective was to develop and assess test-retest reliability of an acceptable questionnaire for collecting health information in remote Aboriginal communities feasible for use in the Lililwan Project.Methods: A questionnaire was developed by paediatricians to assist in diagnosis of FASD. Content was based on a literature review of FASD diagnostic criteria, existing questionnaires and risk factors for FASD and birth defects. Aboriginal community members, including qualified Aboriginal language interpreters, adapted the questionnaire to ensure language and cultural components were appropriate for use in the Fitzroy Valley. Locally developed pictorial aids were used for gathering accurate information on alcohol use. Aboriginal 'community navigators' assisted researchers to translate the questions into Kimberley Kriol or local Aboriginal languages depending on participant preference.A subset of 14 questions was assessed for test-retest reliability in 30 parents/carers of children in the Lililwan Project cohort, who were interviewed by one rater using the entire questionnaire, then by a second rater who repeated 14 critical questions at least 6 hours later.Results: The full questionnaire contained 112 items and took 50 minutes to administer. For a subset of 14 items from the full questionnaire percent exact agreement between raters ranged from 59-100%, and was below 70% for only 1 question. Test-retest reliability was excellent (Kappa 0.81-1.00) for 5 items, substantial (Kappa 0.61-0.80) for 5 items, and moderate, fair or slight (Kappa <0.60) for the remaining 4 items tested. Test-retest reliability for questions relating to alcohol use in pregnancy was excellent. When questions had moderate, fair or slight agreement, information was obtained from alternate sources e.g. medical records. Qualitative feedback from parents/carers confirmed acceptability of the questionnaire.Conclusions: This questionnaire had acceptable test-retest reliability and could be used to collect demographic, socio-cultural and biomedical information relevant to the diagnosis of FASD in Aboriginal communities throughout Australia and elsewhere. Community input is crucial when developing and administering questionnaires for use in cross-cultural contexts.*Lililwan is a Kimberley Kriol word meaning 'all the little ones'.

N2  - Background: Accurate confirmation of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is required as a diagnostic criterion for the majority of children adversely affected by PAE who do not manifest the physical features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. A number of ethanol biomarkers have been used to assess PAE, often with suboptimal results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and cost of PAE screening in newborns by measuring phosphatidylethanol (PEth) in dried blood spot (DBS) cards. Methods: The feasibility of collecting an additional DBS card during routine newborn screening and the background prevalence of PAE were evaluated in a de-identified sample of newborn children delivered at the University of New Mexico Hospital. Electronic orders to collect DBS cards from newborns who continue to bleed after the routine newborn screen, glucose, or hematocrit testing were initiated for all infants delivered during a 4-week time frame. Specimens were sent to a contract laboratory for PEth analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A cost analysis was conducted to compare the cost of PAE screening by PEth in DBS versus PEth in conventional blood specimens and by meconium fatty acid ethyl esters. Results: From 230 collected cards, 201 (87.4%) had at least 1 full blood spot (amount sufficient for PEth analysis), and 6.5% had PEth >20 ng/ml indicative of potential PAE in late pregnancy. PAE screening by PEth in DBS is logistically simpler and less expensive compared with 2 other screening approaches. Conclusions: These results indicate that screening for PAE in DBS cards is a feasible procedure and that a majority of infants have enough blood after the routine heel prick to fill an additional card. Moreover, screening by PEth analysis from DBS cards is cost-efficient. The acceptability of such screening by parents and corresponding ethical issues remain to be investigated. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain development are well documented in infants, children, and adolescents, but the long-term effects into adulthood are poorly understood. We present here the neuropathologic findings in a 34-year-old woman with an early childhood diagnosis of FAS. In addition to the characteristic FAS facial dysmorphia and cognitive impairments, the patient's course was notable for multiple psychiatric manifestations, with co-morbid diagnoses of schizophrenia (with auditory hallucinations), depression, and anxiety. The patient died of an acute pulmonary embolism. At autopsy, the brain was mildly underweight (1150 grams). The cerebral hemispheres demonstrated a simplified gyral pattern and mild underdevelopment of the lateral temporal lobes with striking bilateral clefts between the superior and middle temporal gyri. Histologically, there was an apparent paucity of neurons (both granular and pyramidal) in the temporal cortex, and mild asymmetric hippocampal rotation. The corpus callosum, subcortical nuclei, cerebellum, and brainstem were unremarkable. The ventricles were not enlarged. There were no acquired changes, e.g., infarcts. Moreover, neuronal loss and/or gliosis were not detected in the gray matter structures, and there was no evidence of destructive lesions in the white matter. The analysis of this case provides the unique opportunity to determine the phenotype of the human brain that was exposed to prenatal alcohol more than three decades before death and in which secondary diseases, e.g., atherosclerosis with infarcts, were not present to obscure the phenotype. The primary process appears to be static and malformative without evidence of secondary degenerative lesions, e.g., neuronal loss, over time. While clefts of the temporal lobe have not been reported in FAS, excessive cortical thickness of the lateral temporal gyri and asymmetry of the hippocampi have been described. The relationship of these lesions involving the limbic system to comorbid psychiatric disease in older individuals with FAS is unknown.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are conditions caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in amounts sufficient to cause permanent deficits in brain functioning. Extent of damage largely depends on timing, dose, frequency, and pattern of exposure. Timing is especially important because prenatal alcohol exposure during critical periods of gestation can affect brain development in ways that produce varying patterns of neurocognitive deficits and associated adaptive impairments. This article describes some of the more serious neurophysiological and neuropsychological sequelae of prenatal alcohol exposure that contribute to increased risk for substance abuse problems among people with an FASD. We discuss the unique interface between pharmacological treatment and FASD, noting that failure to consider the possibility of FASD in treatment planning may result in treatment failure and/or relapse. Finally, we present a clinical case example and recommend service accommodations to address some of the impairments in FASD that limit substance abuse treatment success.

N2  - One critical clinical challenge in the fetal alcohol research field is the need to develop more sensitive and reliable biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure that might also serve as predictors of functional brain damage in newborns, allowing for earlier identification of children at risk for longer-term adverse neurobehavioral consequences. Using genomic approaches, we reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy dierentially aects placental and fetal cortical gene expression, including genes coding for proteins associated with nervous, vascular and immune system development. Given the critical role of angiogenesis in both placental function and brain development, we have focused subsequent studies on the impact ofmoderate prenatal ethanol exposure on the expression of four placental proteins associated with angiogenesis. These proteins were measured in both placenta and fetal cortex along with an assessment of cerebral cortical microvascular development. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0%or 5%ethanol solution in 0.066%saccharin water for four hours each day throughout gestation. The mean daily ethanol consumption of 2.72 g/ kg, which produces a peak maternal serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL, did not aectmaternal weight gain, litter size, placental or fetal body weight. On GD20, rat placental:fetal units were removed by Caesarian section and both placenta and cerebral cortex were processed for western blotting analysis. In addition, fetal frontal cortices were evaluated for vascular density in the cortical plate (CP), intermediate zone (IZ), and ventricular zone (VZ) layers. Moderate drinking during pregnancy significantly decreased the expression of cerebral cavernous malformation protein 3 (CCM-3) and inhibin A in both placental and cerebral cortical tissues. In contrast, the levels of annexin A4 and neuropilin 2 were significantly increased in placenta, but not significantly dierent in cerebral cortex. Prenatal ethanol exposure decreased vascular density in all three layers of cerebral cortex. The reduction was statistically significant in the ventricular zone. These results provide preliminary evidence regarding the prospect of using a biosignature pattern of ethanol-induced alterations in placental proteins associated with angiogenesis as a biomarker for altered microvascular development, a process critical for normal brain development and function.

N2  - Alcohol (ethanol) drinking during pregnancy has become a major health and social concern. It has been linked to a wide range of birth-related defects and abnormal behaviors in ospring. In this study, we examined the eect of prenatal alcohol exposure on voluntary alcohol consumption and brain CB1 receptor using alcohol binge model that has been shown to produce a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The pregnant C57BL/6J mice were given alcohol (2.9 g/kg, two doses, 4 hrs apart, i.g.) on gestation days 7 and 8, while control mice received isocaloric maltose-dextrin solution. The results indicate increase in CB1 receptor expression in prefrontal cortex and alcohol consumption (10%v/v) in alcohol exposed adult ospring compared to control groups. Pharmacological antagonismof CB1 receptor function with either SR141716A or AM4113 (a dose of 3 mg/kg body wt. i.p.) significantly decreased alcohol consumption in alcohol exposed ospring. These results suggest that alcohol exposure during gestation day 7 and 8 dysregulates the function of eCB system and increases alcohol consumption in adult ospring. The eCB system might serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of some of the behavioral deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare the nutritional status ofmothers of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) with randomly-selected mothers of children without an FASD. One hundred and seventy-eight mothers (57 mothers of children with FASD and 121mothers with children without FASD) from a community in theWestern Cape Province of South Africa completed 24- hour dietary recall interviews. Data were analyzed with the Nutrition Data System for Research. Using a timeline, follow-back technique, each woman reported how current dietary intake compared to intake during her pregnancy with the index child. Dierence ofmeans tests compared the intake for macronutrients (total grams, fat, carbohydrate, protein, cholesterol, and fiber) andmicronutrients (vitamin A,D,E,K,C,B-complex, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, selenium, sodium, potassium, omega-3s, eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), docosapentanoic acid (DPA) and docshexanoic acid (DHA)) between the Dietary Recommended Intake (DRI) for pregnant women 19-30. Further analyses were made comparing subgroups.Mothers of children with an FASD, alcohol exposed controls, and unexposed controls. Statistical analysis indicated that: compared to DRI, with the exception of vitamin B12, selenium, and sodium, all mothers (FASD and control) were significantly deficient on all micronutrients (p < .000). While all mothers weremicronutrient deficient compared to DRI, mothers of children with FASD in this sample consumed, on average, higher amounts ofmicronutrients than mothers of randomlyselected controls. Analyses of specific micronutrient intake dierences betweenmothers of FASD and control children are ongoing at the time of the abstract preparation, but will be presented. Despite no statistical dierence in the total gram intake, mothers of randomly-selected controls had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) than mothers of children with FASD. These results support previous studies which indicate that people who consume large quantities of alcoholmay be at an additional nutritional disadvantage because chronic alcohol use can cause malabsorption or altered metabolism of nutrients. These results confirm the importance of BMI as one co-factor of risk for FASD, and suggest that nutritional status of the mother may have a direct or indirect eect on the fetus. And poor nutrition could be a co-factor that exacerbates the hallmark characteristics of FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) causes lifelong cognitive deficits found in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) by impairing brain development.We recently showed that dietary prevention of gestational maternal iron deficiency (ID) lessens FASD's learning deficits. Our preliminary data suggest this is due, in part, because alcohol inhibits the fetus from correctly interpreting maternal iron status, thus preventing the proper homeostatic adaptations between the ID fetal brain and liver. In adults, alcohol dysregulates iron homeostasis and suppresses the synthesis of hepcidin, the "master regulator" of iron homeostasis and a potent anti-inflammatory peptide. The consequences of hepcidin dysregulation during gestation to fetal development and its iron-sensing ability are unknown.We investigated this question using a 2nd trimester rat gestational PAEmodel (5 g/kg/d) under conditions of maternal iron suciency (IS) and ID.We evaluated gestational day 20.5 fetal brain, fetal liver, andmaternal liver using real-time PCR for the expression of hepcidin and pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa). Unexpectedly, rather than reducing hepcidin, as in adult alcoholics, PAE increased hepcidin production in both maternal and fetal liver, but not in fetal brain, during both IS and ID. PAE also increased IL-1b and TNFa expression under both IS and ID in fetal liver, brain, and maternal liver. These increases were additive in fetal brain and indicated a feed-forward inflammatory loop driven by alcohol. Additionally, in alcohol's absence, maternal ID increased both IL-1b and TNFa in these fetal andmaternal tissues, as compared with maternal IS. As a whole, our data suggest that PAE during maternal ID causes a more dramatic disruption of fetal iron metabolismand inflammation compared to maternal IS, magnifying the proinflammatory state produced by PAE. A firmer understanding of the impact ofmaternal iron status on PAE's inflammatory action may inform prophylactic and therapeutic dietary interventions withmaternal iron supplementation to reduce the FASD's outcome severity in children.

N2  - Disruption of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated as an important molecular mechanism underlying alcohol (ethanol)-induced birth defects. Recently, haploinsuciency in the Hedgehog receptor Cdon was shown to synergize with prenatal alcohol exposure to produce the facial and brain abnormalities associated with severe forms of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Employing a mousemodel of FAS, the study reported herein was conducted to examine whether single allelemutations in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh; the dominant vertebrate Hh ligand) or Gli2 (the dominant transcriptional activator of the Hh pathway) alter the severity of alcohol-induced facial dysmorphology. Timed-pregnancies were established by mating wildtype C57Bl/6J female mice with Shh+/- or Gli2+/- (backcrossed to C57Bl/6J) malemice. On gestational day (GD)7, timed pregnant dams were treated with two IP doses of 2.9 g/kg ethanol (or vehicle alone), administered four hrs apart. GD17 fetuses were then removed and genotyped. Following rigorous alignment, frontal and sagittal images of each specimen were captured, fromwhich nine unique craniofacial measurements were performed. Vehicle treated wildtype and heterozygous animals were largely indistinguishable. However, relative to their wildtype alcohol-exposed littermates, Shh+/- and Gli2+/- alcohol-exposed ospring exhibited an increase in severity of FAS-associated facial features, including midfacial hypoplasia and hypotelorism.While Shh+/- and Gli2+/- mice have been described as phenotypically normal, this study illustrates a functional haploinsuciency of both genes in combination with alcohol exposure. Additionally, these results further support Hh signaling perturbation as amechanism underlying the pathogenesis of FAS while highlighting the significance of gene-environment interactions for the teratogenic endpoint.

N2  - Because the majority of children adversely aected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) do not present with the physical features characteristic of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, confirmation of maternal drinking is required both for diagnosing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and initiating interventions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to play an important role in the mechanisms underlying the deleterious eects of PAE and are appealing as novel biomarkers since they are very stable in plasma and serum and have shown great promise as biomarkers of cancer and other conditions. In this study we used Exiqon wholemiRome PCR plates to examine the levels of 766 human miRNAs in serum samples from 34 pregnant women (17 Alcohol-users [AU] and 17 abstinent controls [AC]) selected from a well-characterized cohort at UNM. Patients were recruited from a clinic that serves pregnant women with current or past history of substance abuse.Women classified as AU reported >3 drinks/week and/or binge drinking episodes during pregnancy and were positive for at least one conventional ethanol biomarker, whereas controls abstained from alcohol use during pregnancy per self-report and were negative for all ethanol biomarkers. All serum samples were collected at mid-gestation. We found that the levels of 184 of the 341 miRNAs that were detected in serum were significantly altered in the AU group vs. controls (p < 0.05). To validate these findings, a subset of the 12most promising miRNAs due their fold change dierences between the groups was selected and analyzed by individualmiRNA PCR assays. We found that twomiRNAs (miR-200a andmiR-1908) emerged as candidatemiRNAs associated with AU. Furthermore, the ratio of miR- 1908/miR-200a was significantly higher in the AU group compared to controls (p < 0.002). Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, we found that the combination of these miRNAs resulted in an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.83 (p < 0.001) indicative of high sensitivity and specificity.When a novel direct ethanol metabolite (phosphatidylethanol [PEth], measured in a dry blood spot cards of a newborn) was added to the panel, diagnostic accuracy of the test improved further (AUC = 0.95; p = 0.001). In conclusion, our results suggest that alterations in the levels of two serum miRNAs could be used to reliably detect alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to numerous adverse eects on the developing fetus. Theses teratogenic outcomes are termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which in the most severe cases lead to fetal alcohol syndrome. There is a high prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and hearing disorders in the FASD population. Thus, alcohol exposure in utero is a potential factor for the etiology and mechanisms of PAE-related seizures. Evidence indicates that PAE alters auditory brainstemresponses in rodent, and the alterations persist into adulthood. The inferior colliculus (IC), the generator of auditory brainstem response wave V, plays a critical role in the initiation of tonic-clonic seizures following alcohol withdrawal. Thus, alcohol-induced changes in IC neuronal excitability may contribute to the mechanisms of PAE-related seizures.We have previously reported that PAE enhances the current density of high threshold voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels including CaV2.3 (R-type) channels, which exhibit biophysical properties closer to that of low threshold CaV (CaV3 T-type) channels. Here, we examined the eects of PAE on T-type channel currents in dissociated IC neurons obtained from ospring (P3-P7). Pregnant rats received a single dose of 5 g/kg body weight ethanol (95%) as a 30%(v/v) solution in Isomil by gastric intubation at gestational day 18. Control animals received only Isomil. Currents were recorded in the whole cell patch clamp configuration. T-type currents weremeasured using 5 mMCa2+ as charge carrier during voltage steps to - 40 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV. Quantification shows that T-type current density was significantly elevated in IC neurons of ospring subjected to PAE. Pharmacological experiments to dissect T-type currents are in progress. These findings suggest that in addition to high threshold CaV channels, PAE also alters the low threshold CaV channels, which may play important roles in the pathophysiology of PAE-related disorders of neuronal excitability.

N2  - Introduction : Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is characterized by Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). IUGR models show dysfunctional uteroplacental vascular adaptations.We hypothesized that chronic binge alcohol results in uteroplacental vascular dysfunction by disrupting critical endothelial gestational adaptations. Methods: Maternal uterine vascular function was assessed utilizing wire myography following chronic binge alcohol administration in rats (peak blood alcohol concentration, 248 +/- 82.3 mg/dl, gestation day (GD) 7-17 or 19). Complementary proteomic approaches (2-D DIGE gel-based, iTRAQlabel-based, and label-free) and immunoblotting were used to delineate underlying mechanistic perspectives utilizing FAC sorted ovine uterine artery endothelial cells (GD 120-130; term = 147) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Results: Alcohol-induced uterine vascular dysfunction preceded fetal growth deficits (body weight, 21%, P = 0.002; placental weight, 22%, P = 0.001). No differences in uterine artery reactivity was noted in response to vasoconstrictors phenylephrine (P = 0.4) or thromboxane (P = 0.73), and to endothelium-independent dilator SNP (P = 0.65). Alcohol selectively impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation; acetylcholine significantly decreased vessel relaxation (dose and groupmain effect, P < 0.01; logEC50, -7.02 +/- 0.14 vs. -6.53 +/- 0.35; Emax, 14%). Complementary proteomic approaches showed that proteins associated with the key vasodilator nitric oxide (NO), and redox balances were affected (eg, HSP90b, P = 0.014; calmodulin, P < 0.001; thioredoxin, P = 0.017). Further, alcohol decreased levels of total endothelial NO synthase (eNOS, rate limiting enzyme for NOproduction) and excitatory P635eNOS/total eNOS (23%, P < 0.003) compared to the Controls and the related pERK/total ERK signaling (25.7%, P < 0.001). Discussion: (1) Chronic binge alcohol impairs endothelium-dependent uterine artery relaxation that is critical for gas and nutrient delivery to the fetus; 2) Uteroplacental vascular dysfunction precedes FASD growth deficits; 3) Alcohol negatively affects the chief uteroplacental vasodilator system (NO) and related signaling; 4) Rapid and high throughput quantitative proteomic platforms may be very helpful for FASD mechanistic insights, diagnosis, and to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies for FASD; 5) These findings suggest the involvement of the uteroplacental compartment in FASD pathogenesis.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Massive apoptosis of neurons resulting from exposure of the developing brain to alcohol is considered as the main cause of long-lasting structural CNS abnormalities and neuronal cell death by activation of pro-apoptotic caspase 3. We established an in vivo rat FAS model by feeding of 16-day pregnant rats with a 6.7%ethanol liquid diet until delivery.We demonstrate that the levels of proapoptotic caspase 3 and Bax were increased in the brain of pups from the ethanol group, while the early expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl2-associated athanogene-3 (Bag3) was inhibited by ethanol exposure. Bag3 plays an important role in protein quality control and the clearance of misfolded proteins in the developing brain. The level of glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b) playing an essential role in neural development was increased in relation to the decreased Bag3 in the ethanol-treated groups. During the period of Bag3 inhibition, the level of a GSK3b downstreamtarget, b-catenin, was also increased in the brain of ethanol-exposed pups, suggesting its accumulation in cells and dysregulation of b-catenin signaling that can possibly induce developmental brain defects. In vivo studies demonstrated a negative correlation between prenatal ethanol uptake and the development of the brain. Body and brain weight were significantly lower at P5 and P8 in the ethanol groups as compared to control groups, coinciding with low Bag3 expression. Behavioral observations at postnatal days P8 and P15 revealed hearing and feeding diculties and eye blink deficits in the ethanol group when compared to controls.We also found dysregulation of synaptophysin and genes that control synaptogenesis. These genes were also altered in an in vitro human FAS model, where we used primary neuronal culture and utilized a relevant concentration of ethanol (50 mM) for 24 hours. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that biphasic Bag3 expression (low in developing brain and increases with aging) is strongly inhibited by ethanol exposure. These changes were accompanied by alterations in key signaling pathways in the brain including early postnatal expression and accumulation of apoptosis-related and developmentally regulated proteins, neuronal loss and developmental delays later in life.

N2  - This study is a collaboration between Motherisk and theMaternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC), which collected meconiumsamples throughout Canada to measure environmental chemicals, but not alcohol. The focus of our study is to investigate the incidence of heavy fetal alcohol exposure bymeconium FAEE analysis in Canada, as well as correlating neonatal outcomes and fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) concentrations. FAEEs serve as an established biomarker for in utero alcohol exposure. Meconium was collected from 1537 newborns at 11 obstetric units across Canada and participatingmothers also completed questionnaires that contained a section focusing on alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. The questionnaires will serve as a maternal self-report and will be compared to meconium FAEE concentration. Any meconiumsample with a total FAEE concentration (the sum of ethyl palmitate, oleate, stearate and linoleate concentrations) greater than 2 nmol/g meconium is classified as positive for excessive alcohol consumption during the second and/or third trimesters of pregnancy. Additionally, neonatal and maternal outcomes were recorded and will be correlated with total and individual FAEE concentrations to determine any associations. MeconiumFAEE analysis of the samples by GC-MS is currently ongoing at theMotherisk Laboratory. This study is the first National study on heavy fetal alcohol exposure anywhere in the world. Because an estimated 40%of heavily alcohol-exposed fetuses exhibit FASD, this approach will yield the most accurate estimate of the incidence of FASD in Canada.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) is one of the most prominent causes of mental retardation in the developed world, as heavy alcohol consumption can cause gross structural and physiological abnormalities in the central nervous systemresulting in deficits in learning and memory processes. Heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome, while moremoderate consumption of ethanol causes more subtle physiological changes. Underlying many of learning and memory deficits observed in FAE are alterations in gene expression, which when properly characterized will lead to a better understanding of the neurological abnormalities occurring following exposure to alcohol during development. One important regulator of gene expression is the RNA binding protein HuD, which binds to and stabilizes transcripts containing a HuD binding site. This protein is important during development for proper axonal outgrowth and targeting, as well as during learning andmemory processes. For these experiments, pregnant Long-Evans rats were given 5% saccharin- sweetened ethanol in a voluntary exposure paradigm.Once the pups reached adulthood, the animals were sacrificed and hippocampi harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was then extracted and HuD mRNA levels analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. HuD mRNA levels in hippocampi from rats exposed to ethanol in utero were significantly lower than saccharin exposed control animals. These results suggest that FAE could be limiting HuD expression, which could have a number of downstream eecs. Lower basal expression levels of HuD in FAE could be one factor contributing to deficits in learning andmemory processes. HuD stabilizes a number of transcripts involved in long-term potentiation, so learning and memory deficits in FAE could also be a results of abnormal synaptic plasticity. Decreased HuD expression could also lead to changes in the expression of HuD RNA targets involved in hippocampal dependent memory, leading to a cascade of changes in gene expression that would have a profound impact on neural function.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce persistent adverse developmental outcomes, collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Despite the substantial research characterizing the brain injury and resultant neurodevelopmental disabilities, a significant gap still exists in providing coordinated, timely and eective care and supportive policies for children with FASD. Furthermore, relatively little research has been conducted on interventions that provide eective services for these children. The purpose of this research was to perform a needs assessment that could be used to develop a customized, internet-based intervention that provides families aected by FASD with the appropriate strategies tomanage challenging behaviours and to facilitate positive interactions. Sixty caregivers and 26 clinicians from across Canada were interviewed by telephone. The questions were open-ended and designed to gain insight into the behavioural and emotional problems associated with FASD, eective and ineective parenting strategies, as well as the skills needed to manage challenging behaviours. Caregivers reported that themost challenging behaviour categories were Externalizing Behaviours (most common subcategories: 1st temper tantrums/anger; 2nd violence/ aggression; 3rd impulsivity), Cognitive Diculties (most common subcategories: 1st memory; 2nd language problems; 3rd attention problems) and Social Diculties/Maladjustment (most common subcategories: 1st issues with playing; 2nd inability to filter; 3rd annoys/aggravates others). The most successful parenting strategies were Parental Reflection, Routine/Structure/ Consistency and Environmental Modification, while the use of Aggression, Unrealistic Expectations and Consequences and Rewards were the least eective. When caregivers were asked the best way to deliver assistance, the top response was Internet followed by Support Groups. Clinicians reported that Issues with Professional Institutes and Behavioural Diculties/Challenges were the most common concerns they heard from caregivers of children with FASD; and the major limitations in accessing services and supports were Lack of Knowledge, Awareness and Training, Services and Supports are not accessible and Services and Supports Do not Exist. These data will inform the development of the intervention program Strongest Families: FASD, which will provide a family-centered approach to training, education and support for children with FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with increased sleep problems which may aggravate the neurobehavioural problems in children with FASD. Treatment of sleep problems in these children is a challenge, at least partly due to an incomplete understanding of the specific nature of the problems. We have completed a study to develop and evaluate 2 intervention programs (a motor-skill development and a neurofeedback program) for children with FASD. One of the objectives of this study was to assess the nature and occurrence of sleep disturbances in participating children. Methods: The caregivers of 43 children with FASD filled out a questionnaire developed to survey sleep disturbances. The questionnaire assessed the prevalence and frequency of sleep disturbances, as well as specific problems with going to bed or falling asleep, and waking up during the night. Caregivers were also asked to rate the quality of life of themselves and their child (on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being highest), and to rate what the quality would be if the sleep problems were solved. Information was also collected on the use of melatonin, which is commonly used to treat problems with falling asleep. Results: Twenty-nine out of 43 children (67%) were reported to have sleep disturbances. Most (27 of 29) had problems going to bed or falling asleep, with 10 children experiencing problems every night and 12 experiencing problems 3-6 times weekly. Twenty children had problems with waking in the night, with 3 experiencing problems every night, and 4 experiencing problems 3-6 nights weekly. Of 26 respondents, 16 caregivers reported that their child's quality of life would improve if the sleep problems were solved, while 14 reported that their own quality of life would improve. Average quality of life scores were lower for the children with sleep disturbances (7.1+/- 2.0) and their caregivers (6.7+/-1.8), compared to children without sleep disturbances (8.0+/-2.0) and their caregivers (7.6+/-1.6), but these differences were not significant (p=0.166 for children, p=0.107 for caregivers). Twenty-four children had used melatonin for sleep problems, with 19 currently using melatonin. Only 13 caregivers had sought help from the medical systemfor their children's sleep issues. Conclusions: A high proportion of children with FASD experience frequent sleep disturbances, which are perceived by over half of caregivers to affect the quality of life of themselves and their children.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters the structure of specific brain regions, and these alterations correspond with a highly complex pattern of impairments in neurocognition, self-regulation, and adaptive functioning. However, very little is known about how PAE alters structural white matter connectivity among regions. Diusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a MRI technique that allows for the assessment of whitematter integrity by measuring restriction of water diusion known as fractional anisotropy (FA). Evidence from rodent models demonstrates that the development of myelination: 1) is reduced by PAE; and 2) begins earlier in females compared tomales. Similarly fromhuman studies, decreased integrity of several whitematter tracts were observed among individuals with a FASD compared to Controls. However, nothing is known about how the integrity of white matter tracts may dier between boys compared to girls with a FASD. In the current study, Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were utilized for analysis of DTI images in order to investigate tract integrity in FASD vs. Control boys and girls (ages 5 to 16 years). We hypothesized reduced integrity of whitematter tracts (lower FA) in FASD compared to Control participants, and that the eects of FASD on structural integrity will be sexually dimorphic. Independent t-tests were performed between each group and sex, and significance was determined by threshold-free clustering and a voxelwise significance of p<.05. Preliminary findings showed that youth with a FASD exhibit lower values of FA in frontal gyrus white matter. Interestingly, this eect was observed in opposite hemispheres between sexes, with reduced FA values occurring in the right hemisphere of FASD girls, but in the left hemisphere of FASD boys when compared to their sex matched Control peers. Interestingly, higher values of FA were observed in FASD compared to Control youth. Specifically, FASD girls had higher FA in the cerebellum, whereas FASD boys showed higher values in the posterior thalamic radiation, when compared to sex matched Controls. These novel findings provide evidence that PAE alters white matter microstructure in a sexually dimorphicmanner. Importantly, the present results have implications for understanding structural connectivity among regions that are implicated in cognitive, behavioral and mental health problems that occur at a high prevalence among individuals with an FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol has been linked to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) which includes a wide range of developmental deficits from non-detectable to severe mental retardation. Because women who abuse alcohol often ignore proper food intake, we investigate the contribution of nutritional disparity to FASD.We have previously observed that moderate alcohol and under-nourishment can independently cause partial and reversible facial dysmorphology, but moderate alcohol combined with under-nourishment exerted severe facial dysmorphology that could not be alleviated.We have also reported that DNA methylation is a programmed event playing a role in transcriptional regulation throughout neural development and that alcohol delays this epigenetic program and may contribute to FASD etiology. Because DNAmethylation depends on the availability ofmethyl donors, we set out to investigate the role of nutritional deficiency in alcohol-induced epigenetic alteration. Using an alcohol in liquid-diet mousemodel (4%v/v, across gestational days 7-17,) total free access nutrition was calorically matched to Chow controls but with 50-75%micronutrient deficiency. An alcohol-free isocaloric pair-fed (PF) control was also used. The cortices and cerebellumof all groups were immunostained with antibodies against DNA methylation markers 5-methylcytosine (5meC) and, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at postnatal day 7 and 21.We found that nutritional deficiency during gestation is independently capable of hindering the cell-specific DNA methylation program of the cerebellum which we have previously described. Specifically, nutritional deficiency was associated with an intranuclear reorganization of 5meC and 5hmC in addition to cellular growth restriction. Though this was also observed in alcohol-treated groups, nutritional deficiency exacerbated the eects of alcohol. This is in agreement with our long time observations of dysmorphogenesis at the rank of Alcohol> PF> Chow and further posits the question of whether nutritional supplementation can alleviate the burden of fetal alcohol. Preliminary evidence has indeed shown that nutritional supplementation can increase the daily intakes of liquid-diet of pregnant females. Due to the high incidence of nutritional insuciency associated with mothers who abuse alcohol during pregnancy, it is important to investigate the relationship between alcohol andmalnutrition further, as a step toward the development of a viable therapeutic.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal exposure to alcohol may negatively affect the developing brain with long term effects on development and behaviour. South Africa has a high prevalence of alcohol abuse and associated fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. A number of neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine systems are being implicated as underlying the association between maternal alcohol, and subsequent negative behavioural outcomes in offspring. In particular, the glutamatergic system, appears to be disrupted in offspring of rodent mothers exposed to stress. There has been relatively little work, however, on the glutamatergic system during early life in humans. This study aims to assess the effects ofmaternal alcohol use on infant neuronal integrity and glutamatergic function, as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Methods: Pregnant mothers in a Cape Town community were consented and further identified using the ASSIST questionnaire. Mothers screening positive for alcohol use in preganacy were administered a more detailed assessment of their alcohol use. Infants of these mothers as well as matched controls were assessed byMRS scan at 2-4 weeks of age performed during natural sleep. The MRS findings of index children were compared to that of the controls. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics committee. Results: Twenty eight infants aged between 2-4 weeks underwent MRS scans (12 controls, 15 alcohol-exposed infants, 1 infant was co-exposed to methamphetamines). Comparisons of group data on the findings from voxels placed over Parietal white matter (PWM) of infants exposed to alcohol prenatally showed significantly decreased Glx peak (Glu + Gln, p = 0.009) and significantly increased macromolecules and lipids (MM09 + Lip09, p = 0.007) (PWM nControl = 5, PWM nAlcohol=5).Parietal grey matter (PGM) of infants exposed to alcohol prenatally showed no significant differences (PGM nControl = 7, PWM nAlcohol=10). Discussion: This research advances understanding of the relevant mechanisms resulting in the neurological effects of alcohol and stimulant exposure. This may ultimately drive therapeutic approaches. The study offers an important opportunity to contribute to the protection of child health in South Africa and to further knowledge to benefit children in developing countries exposed to alcohol in pregnancy.

N2  - With Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) occurring in 2-5%of US live births, interventions are needed that assist women in reducing prenatal alcohol use to decrease the risk of FASD. This study determined the eectiveness of a single-session motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to decrease prenatal alcohol use. It also investigated the influence of self-determination theory mechanisms of basic psychological needs satisfaction and autonomous motivation on drinking behaviors. Of 184 women attending a prenatal visit (66%African American, mean age 25.4, mean weeks gestation 24.3), 122 women screened positive for previous year alcohol use asmeasured by the AUDIT or quantity/frequency measures of alcohol use. These women then completed the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS) and Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ) before randomization to an MI or comparison group. TheMI group received the intervention at the same or next prenatal visit. Both groups completed 30 day postbaseline (n = 92) and 30 day postpartum (n = 102) followups. Poisson regression using generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique to account for the repeated nature of the data found no significant main eects of MI on drink days per week, drinks per day, and total AUDIT scores. No interaction eects were noted, except for a significant interaction eect of MI on drink days per week showing the MI group to increase drink days per week, while the comparison group changed little across time. However, due to curvilinearity, strong caution is suggested when interpreting results. Linear regression using GEE did demonstrate a significant eect of time on BPNS and Relative Autonomy Index scores of the TSRQ with both increasing over time. In this study,MI was not found eective in decreasing prenatal alcohol use or in increasing basic psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivations to decrease prenatal alcohol use. However, future studies with increased numbers of data collection points would better allow interpretation and analysis of curvilinear relationships. Likewise, larger sample sizes with increased numbers of higher level drinkers would increase statistical power, as well as allow exploration of the eects of MI with women whose children are at higher risk for FASD. Additional sessions of the intervention, or booster interventions, are recommended to determineMI's ability to decrease prenatal alcohol use in the future.

N2  - This study aims to establish the incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure in the province of Prince Edward Island (PEI) in order to inform future public health initiatives addressing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. FASD in a leading preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disability in North America. Obtaining information about prenatal alcohol use in challenging via self-report due to the stigma associated with alcohol abuse in pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol exposure was investigated via population- based collection and analysis of meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE). FAEE are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol produced in the fetus and deposited into meconium. FAEE meconium concentrations greater than 2.0 nmol/g are indicative of frequent prenatal alcohol exposure during the last two trimesters of pregnancy. Meconium samples were collected from 1307 neonates born between November 2010 and November 2011 in hospitals on PEI or born to PEI-citizens giving birth at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Samples were frozen and shipped for analysis. FAEE were extracted via liquid-liquid extraction followed by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Four FAEE were quantified using deuterated internal standards; ethyl palmitate, ethyl linolate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate. Of 1307 samples collected, 1271 samples were successfully analyzed. Results were positive in 3.1%ofmeconium samples collected within the first twenty-four hours after delivery. It is estimated that approximately 40%of alcohol-exposed neonates will have FASD. This study suggests that approximately 1.3%of neonates born in the province will have FASD. This is the first province-wide study of fetal alcohol exposure conducted in Canada.

N2  - Purpose: Sensory processing impairments are reported frequently among children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). This pilot study aimed to validate previous clinical and behavioral findings by examining physiological reactivity to discrete, non-noxious sensory stimuli using the Sensory Challenge Protocol (SCP), a laboratory paradigm used with children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. Methods: Twenty-three children ages 5 through 11 years (11 with FASD; 12 with typical development and no prenatal alcohol exposure) participated in a two group comparison study. Sensory processing behaviors were measured by parent-report using the Short Sensory Profile (SSP; Dunn, 1999). Physiological reactivity to sensation was examined during the SCP using 1) electrodermal skin reactivity (EDR), 2) heart rate (HR), 3) heart rate variability (HRV) and 4) salivary cortisol levels taken at baseline, 15 and 30 minutes after the SCP. Results: Children with FASD showed significantly lower average EDR maximum amplitude during four of six sensory and the recovery conditions compared to controls. Significant differences in HRV change from baseline were detected in two of six sensory conditions and recovery. No significant group differences in heart rate outcomes or salivary cortisol levels at baseline or 15 and 30 minutes post SCP were found. Conclusions: Differential autonomic responses (EDR and HRV) to sensation and during recovery, but no differences in neuroendocrine responses, were found between children with FASD compared to controls without alcohol exposure. The direction and magnitude of these experimental differences require further investigation to understand the biobehavioral interplay between sensory reactivity and sensory processing behaviors among children with FASD.

N2  - Arithmetic has been identified as a particularly sensitive developmental endpoint for prenatal alcohol exposure. Our Detroit behavioral data suggest that fetal alcohol-related impairment in arithmetic is mediated primarily by a specific deficit in the core quantity systeminvolving the ability to mentally represent and manipulate number, a finding that we have confirmed in a Cape Town cohort. Five parietal regions are known to be critical in number processing: left and right horizontal intraparietal sulcus (IPS), left and right posterior superior parietal lobe (PSPL), and left angular gyrus (AG). IPS is activated in tasks involving relative quantities (magnitude representation), left AG during manipulation of numbers in verbal form. 59 right-handed children (age 7.9-13.4 yr) were administered fMRI tasks in Cape Town, South Africa. Prenatal alcohol exposure was assessed by maternal interview for oz absolute alcohol (AA)/day averaged across pregnancy, AA/drinking occasion, and drinking frequency. 14 children were diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS), 21 non-syndromal heavily exposed, and 24 controls whosemothers abstained or drank no more than minimally. fMRI data were acquired during exact addition (EA) (e.g.,"2 + 3 = 5 or 6?") and proximity judgment (PJ) (e.g.,"Is 5 closer to 4 or 7?"). Each of these self-paced tasks comprised 3 task (40s), 3 control (40s) and 3 rest blocks (20s), which were interleaved. Runs for which children scored <60% were excluded. fMRI regions of interest were defined as spheres, radius 6 mm. Because the tasks were simplified, the groups did not differ in accuracy on either task. However, the FAS/PFAS group completed fewer sums correctly during PJ (F(2,44)=3.40,p < 0.05). Increased AA/day and AA/occasion were associated with decreased activation in right IPS during both tasks (rs ranged from -0.36 to-0.38, ps<0.05). Although brain activation was not related to accuracy during EA, activity in left PSPL related inversely to accuracy on PJ (r = -0.55, p < 0.001). The reduced activation in right IPS is consistent with our previous behavioral findings suggesting a fetal alcohol-related specific deficit in representation and manipulation of quantity. Greater activation in left PSPL by children who perform the PJ task more poorly suggests that this regionmay be used to compensate for the reduced facility in magnitude representation in this group.

N2  - Background: Attention deficits are often observed in children with prenatal alcohol exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often diagnosed in this population. This study used an objective assessment tool to examine differences between alcohol-exposed and non-exposed children, with and without an ADHD diagnosis on core symptoms of ADHD: inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Method: Subjects (6-17y, M = 11.77) comprised four groups: alcohol-exposed with ADHD (AE+, n = 33), alcohol-exposed without ADHD (AE-, n = 19), non-exposed with ADHD (ADHD, n = 41), and non-exposed controls without ADHD (CON, n = 52). Subjects were evaluated with the Quotient ADHD System, which provides objective data on ADHD core symptoms. The system uses a motiontracking system to measure activity during a continuous performance task, measuring inattention and impulsivity. Data on six motion and six attention parameters were obtained and each dependent variable examined separately. Data were analyzed with a 2 (AE) x 2 (ADHD) between-subjects ANCOVA, using age as a covariate. Results: The AE x ADHD interaction was significant only for the number of commission errors (p = .040). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the average number of commission errors was significantly higher for the ADHD group compared to the CON and AE+ groups (p < .05). A significant main effect of ADHD diagnosis was observed on measures of omission errors, variability in response time, coefficient of variance, number of headmovements, distance, and area traveled (p < .05). The main effect of AE was significant on measures of omission errors, response latency, and variability in response time (p < .05). Conclusions: There was a high degree of similarity between alcohol-exposed children, regardless of ADHD diagnosis on this objectivemeasure of activity and attention. There was also a high degree of similarity between the AE groups and the non-exposed children with ADHD. However, impulsivity as measured by commission errors, was detected among the non-exposed children with ADHD but not in either alcohol-exposed group. Future studies should investigate the utility of the Quotient ADHD System in diagnosing individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and include expanded assessment of impulsivity, as thismeasure may aid in differential diagnosis of prenatal alcohol exposure versus ADHD due to other causes.

N2  - Background Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) comprises a triad of growth impairment, central nervous system dysfunction and characteristic facial features. Diagnosis is complex and often not recognised at an early age. The three facial features: short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip, are unique to FAS. Clinical examination is inherently subjective and apart from palpebral fissure length, minimal reference data is available in neonates. Establishing a standardised method and normal range would promote an objective assessment. Earlier diagnosis would enable earlier effective interventions. Methods Standardised digital facial photographs were taken of normal term Caucasian neonates. Mothers completed anonymous questionnaires about alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Photographs were assessed using Facial Analysis Software to obtain values for palpebral fissure length (PFL) and upper lip circularity (LC). Upper lip thinness and philtrum smoothness were ranked according to 5-point Likert Scale. Results 29 infants were studied, 17 male: 12 female. Mean gestational age 40.3 weeks (range 37.1-42.3), mean weight 3556g. 23 (79%) had no prenatal alcohol exposure whilst 6 had minimal exposure (1-2units/week). PFL measurements could be obtained from 21 photographs (72%) with mean of 15.6 mm (range 13.7-18.7mm). Upper lip and philtrum values could be determined in 24 (83%). Mean LC was 57.21 (range 31.4-128.2). Mean rank scores for upper lip and philtrum were both 3. Conclusion It has been possible to gain measurements of facial features in just over 3/4 of neonates studied, showing the feasibility of this technique in this age-group. Further results are needed to establish reference ranges.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure is the leading preventable cause of birth and developmental defects in the United States. Despite a growing body of knowledge about the spectrum of disorders resulting from fetal alcohol exposure, 1 in 9 pregnant women continues to drink alcohol during pregnancy, and a small percentage of pregnant women continues to binge drink. Health care providers do not consistently screen pregnant women for alcohol use, nor do health professionals necessarily know how to counsel pregnant women effectively about the risks of fetal alcohol exposure. In this article, we review the epidemiology of fetal alcohol exposure and discuss current strategies for screening and prevention of fetal alcohol exposure. We also explore the multiple barriers that exist toward reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancies from the patient, provider, and systems perspectives. Finally, we make recommendations for improved clinical and public health strategies to eliminate fetal alcohol exposure in the United States.Target Audience: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physiciansLearning Objectives: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to describe rates of fetal alcohol exposure in the United States, describe the demographic characteristics of women at highest risk for fetal alcohol exposure, counsel patients appropriately regarding the risk of poor fetal outcomes in association with fetal alcohol exposure, and understand the barriers to effective counseling about fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: The prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were determined in this fourth study of first-grade children in a South African community. Methods: Active case ascertainment methods were employed among 747 first-grade pupils. The detailed characteristics of children within the continuum of FASD are contrasted with randomly selected, normal controls on (i) physical growth and dysmorphology; (ii) cognitive/behavioral characteristics; and (iii) maternal risk factors. Results: The rates of specific diagnoses within the FASD spectrum continue to be among the highest reported in any community in the world. The prevalence (per 1,000) is as follows: fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)-59.3 to 91.0; partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS)-45.3 to 69.6; and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)-30.5 to 46.8. The overall rate of FASD is therefore 135.1 to 207.5 per 1,000 (or 13.6 to 20.9%). Clinical profiles of the physical and cognitive/behavioral traits of children with a specific FASD diagnosis and controls are provided for understanding the full spectrum of FASD in a community. The spectral effect is evident in the characteristics of the diagnostic groups and summarized by the total (mean) dysmorphology scores of the children: FAS = 18.9; PFAS = 14.3; ARND = 12.2; and normal controls, alcohol exposed = 8.2 and unexposed = 7.1. Documented drinking during pregnancy is significantly correlated with verbal (r = -0.253) and nonverbal ability (r = -0.265), negative behaviors (r = 0.203), and total dysmorphology score (r = 0.431). Other measures of drinking during pregnancy are significantly associated with FASD, including binge drinking as low as 3 drinks per episode on 2 days of the week. Conclusions: High rates of specific diagnoses within FASD were well documented in this new cohort of children. FASD persists in this community. The data reflect an increased ability to provide accurate and discriminating diagnoses throughout the continuum of FASD. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a congenital syndrome caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and is entirely preventable by abstinence from alcohol drinking during this time. Little is known about the prevalence of FAS and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Western countries. We present the results of FAS/partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) prevalence study and maternal characteristics in a sample of schoolchildren from a rural province of Croatia. This study involved seven elementary schools with 1,110 enrolled children attending 1st to 4th grade and their mothers. We used an active case ascertainment method with passive parental consent and Clarified IOM criteria. The investigation protocol involved maternal data collection and clinical examination of children. Out of 1,110 mothers, 917 (82.6%) answered the questionnaire. Alcohol exposure during pregnancy was admitted by 11.5%, regular drinking by 4.0% and binge drinking by 1.4% of questioned mothers. Clinical examination involved 824 (74.2%) schoolchildren and disclosed 14 (1.7%) with clinical signs of FAS and 41 (5.0%) of PFAS. The observed FAS prevalence, based on 74.2% participation rate, was 16.9, PFAS 49.7 and combined prevalence was 66.7/1,000 examined schoolchildren. This is the first FAS prevalence study based on active ascertainment among schoolchildren and pregnancy alcohol drinking analysis performed in a rural community of Croatia and Europe. High prevalence of FAS/PFAS and pregnancy alcohol consumption observed in this study revealed that FAS is serious health problem in rural regions as well as a need to develop future studies and preventive measures for pregnancy alcohol drinking and FASD.

T1  - Spirit(ed) away: Preventing foetal alcohol syndrome with motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy
A1  - Jansen Van Vuuren A.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a growing concern in South Africa. In the Western Cape, prevalence rates for FAS are the highest in the world. Not surprisingly, the Western Cape also has some of the highest levels of alcohol consumption per capita. Although FAS is primarily caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the high rate of FAS in South Africa originates from a multitude of complex factors. These factors include heritage, poverty, high levels of unemployment and low-paid menial jobs, depression, low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, increased accessibility to alcohol, lack of recreation, poor education, familial pressure, denial, cultural misconceptions and the smaller physiques of some of the women in the Western Cape. Holistic and comprehensive macro- and micro-level approaches are necessary in order to change the alcohol consumption trend that has developed over the last 300 years. No single strategy will reduce or eliminate the burden of alcohol misuse in this society. However, as the presented discussion suggests, combining the spirit of motivational interviewing (MI) with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) practice, borrowed from health psychological interventions for lifestyle-related chronic health conditions, holds promise for reducing the prevalence of FAS within Western Cape communities. These individual-based approaches have yet to be employed in South Africa despite the wealth of evidence that demonstrates their potential in targeting high-risk groups and reducing per capita alcohol consumption. © SAAFP.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol has consistently been associated with adverse effects on neurodevelopment, which is collectively called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Increasing evidence suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol increases the risk of developing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like behavior in human. In this study, we investigated the behavioral effects of prenatal exposure to EtOH in offspring mice and rats focusing on hyperactivity and impulsivity. We also examined changes in dopamine transporter and MeCP2 expression, which may underlie as a key neurobiological and epigenetic determinant in FASD and hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive behaviors. Mouse or rat offspring born from dam exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (EtOH group) showed hyper locomotive activity, attention deficit and impulsivity. EtOH group also showed increased dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter level compared to control group in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Prenatal exposure to EtOH also significantly decreased the expression of MeCP2 in both prefrontal cortex and striatum. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to EtOH induces hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive behaviors in rodent offspring that might be related to global epigenetic changes as well as aberration in catecholamine neurotransmitter transporter system. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Objectives To examine alcohol-use disorders in pregnant women and the extent of under-reporting. Design Population-based cohort study. Setting Western Australia. Population Women with a birth recorded on the Western Australian Midwives Notification System (1985-2006). Methods Mothers with an International Classification of Diseases 9/10 alcohol-related diagnosis, indicating heavy alcohol consumption, recorded on population-based health datasets (non-Aboriginal n = 5839; Aboriginal n = 2583) were identified through the Western Australian data-linkage system. This 'exposed' cohort was frequency matched (on maternal age, year of birth of offspring, Aboriginal status) with comparison mothers without an alcohol-related diagnosis (non-Aboriginal n = 33 979; Aboriginal n = 8005). Main outcome measures Trends in maternal alcohol diagnoses in relation to pregnancy for non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal women. The proportion of children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) who had a mother with an alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy. Results The proportion of Aboriginal mothers in Western Australia with an alcohol diagnosis (23.1%) is ten times greater than for non-Aboriginal mothers (2.3%). There has been a six-fold increase in the percentage of non-Aboriginal births with a maternal alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy and a 100-fold increase for Aboriginal births. Around 70% of the mothers of children diagnosed with FAS did not have an alcohol diagnosis recorded during pregnancy and 18% of the mothers had no record of an alcohol diagnosis. Conclusions Maternal alcohol exposure during pregnancy is significantly under-ascertained. Given the severe risks to the fetus from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, assessment and recording of alcohol use should be routinely undertaken in maternity and other health settings. © 2013 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology © 2013 RCOG.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol leads to widespread cognitive deficits, including problems with attention and response inhibition. This study examined blood oxygen level-dependent response in children with and without histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure during a task of response inhibition consisting of cued and noncued trials. Methods: Children and adolescents (ages 8 to 18 years) with (alcohol-exposed [AE] = 20) and without (control [CON] = 15) histories of heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a go/no-go task. Unbeknownst to subjects, a predictive cue preceded the no-go stimulus in 87% of trials. Results: Groups were matched on demographic variables and did not differ on most measures of task performance. However, following cued stimuli, the AE group demonstrated a lower hit rate to go stimuli and more conservative response bias than the CON group. AE participants demonstrated more activation during no-go trials (inhibition) relative to go trials in the left precuneus, cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate, and right medial frontal gyrus. During cue-dependent response inhibition, the AE group demonstrated less activation in the left precentral and postcentral gyrus compared to the CON group. Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies of response inhibition, the AE group demonstrated greater frontal and parietal activation when attempting to inhibit prepotent responses than the CON group, despite similar rates of commission errors. This study further demonstrated that the AE group had impaired behavioral performance on cued trials and demonstrated less activation in precentral and postcentral gyri relative to the CON group on these trials. This investigation provides evidence of impaired behavioral and neural processing of sequential information in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, which can help improve inhibition in typical populations. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objectives This study compares the behavioral profile of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) who were diagnosed using the Canadian Guidelines with children with prenatal alcohol exposure who did not meet criteria for a FASD diagnosis. Methods and Procedures To accomplish this, we used caregiver and teacher questionnaires evaluating different aspects of behavior. Investigated were 170 children, 109 who received a diagnosis of FASD (Diagnosed Group) and 61 who did not (Non-Diagnosed Group). On the caregiver report, children in the Diagnosed Group had more internalizing and externalizing problems on the CBCL, more executive function difficulties on the BRIEF and more attention problems on the Conner's Rating Scale, compared to the Non-Diagnosed Group. On teacher report, children in the Diagnosed Group had more internalizing and externalizing problems on the TRF and more attention problems on the Conner's Rating Scale, compared to the Non-Diagnosed Group. For both informants, more children in the Diagnosed group had scores in the clinically elevated range. Conclusion Overall, the present results identify key caregiver and teacher-rated profiles of children with FASD diagnoses. These profiles will aid in better understanding, diagnosing and providing focused treatment approaches for children with FASD. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Objective Children with FASD display a heterogeneous profile and may have deficits in physical, behavioural, emotional, and social functioning, as the result of prenatal alcohol exposure. The major objective of the current study was to identify if a specific pattern of neuropsychological functioning exists among children prenatally exposed to alcohol who received a diagnosis, versus exposed children who did not. We compared groups on domains of intellectual functioning, memory, attention, executive functioning, motor functioning, language/communication and achievement. Methods One hundred and seventy children who were seen in the clinic between 2005 and 2009 were included in this study. Out of the total 170 children seen, 109 received an FASD diagnosis. Results We identified a specific neuropsychological profile that typifies children diagnosed with an FASD versus those exposed prenatally to alcohol, who did not receive a diagnosis. Diagnosed children displayed a neuropsychological profile characterized by weaknesses in the areas of verbal reasoning, memory, overall language functioning, math reasoning and calculation. Groups did not differ on measures of attention or executive functioning. Conclusion The information gained from these analyses, are essential for informing best practices for diagnosis and treatment. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - According to the World Health Organization, alcohol is the third most dangerous factor following smoking of tobacco and hypertension of risks impacting health of the population. 50 % of men and 10 % of women suffer from diseases caused by alcohol drinking. Chronic consumption of alcohol damages the nervous system, causes adverse changes in the circulatory system and intestine, increases the risk of cancers. Comparing the impact of alcohol on the health of women and men, in case of women, even similar levels of consumption cause stronger action. Alcohol is the cause of endocrine diseases and among others- reduces fertility. It is the risk factor of premature deliveries, abortions, and placenta- associated pathologies. Disorders of children with prenatal exposure to alcohol are described as fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorders and alcohol related birth defects. It is recommended to impose a total ban on alcohol consumption by pregnant women. Moreover one should emphasize that the minimum safe dose of alcohol for the foetus cannot be specified. In order to resolve alcohol drinking problems a cooperation of representatives of many professions such as: doctors, psychologists, educators and employees of care facilities is necessary. It is also obligatory to obtain support and assistance from the nearest surroundings of the patient.

T1  - Powers and faden's theory of social justice applied to the problem of foetal alcohol syndrome in South Africa
A1  - Horn L.
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - South Africa has the highest rate of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the world. The problem of alcohol abuse in pregnancy has very deep historical roots that are intertwined with the injustices of both apartheid and pre-apartheid colonialism. Much of the research that is being done in these communities is focused on identifying the epidemiological variables associated with these patterns of alcohol abuse. The underlying reasons as to why these patterns continue seem to remain largely obscured from view. In this article, I apply the theory proposed by Powers and Faden of social justice as a 'moral foundation for public health and health policy' to the problem of FAS in South Africa. The objective of this application is two-fold: first, to critically explore the additional insights and alternative perspectives to the problem of FAS that this approach may provide and second, to assess the utility of the theory when applied directly to a specific public health problem. I conclude by noting that although this approach could result in the kind of 'public health scope creep' that has been criticized by various authors, it does provide fresh insights to the problem of FAS in South Africa. © 2013 The Author.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable, biomarkers of alcohol use are sometimes necessary to accurately determine fetal risk. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG), a direct metabolite of ethanol, has been detected in the meconium of infants born to mothers who consumed excessive alcohol during pregnancy. It is still unknown whether EtG detected in meconium originated from maternal hepatic glucuronidation of ethanol followed by subsequent placental transfer. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if EtG crosses the human placenta. Methods: The transfer of EtG was measured using the ex vivo dual perfusion of an isolated human placental lobule. EtG (1 mug/mL) was added to the maternal circulation and samples were taken throughout the 1 h pre-experimental and 3 h experimental phases for measurement of EtG and markers of placental viability. Results: After 3 h, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 0.29 +/- 0.02 and net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring. Triplicate averages of EtG concentrations in perfused placental lobules ranged from 140 to 414 ng/g tissue. Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all perfusions. Discussion: The data show that EtG crosses the human placenta and primarily represents maternal exposure to alcohol. Conclusions: This information can help with the development of more thorough biomarker screens for alcohol use during pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) results in a broad array of neurobehavioral deficits. Recent research has focused on identification of a neurobehavioral profile or profiles that will improve the identification of children affected by AE. This study aimed to build on our preliminary neurobehavioral profile to improve classification accuracy and test the specificity of the resulting profile in an alternate clinical group. Methods: A standardized neuropsychological test battery was administered to 3 groups of children: subjects with AE (n = 209), typically developing controls (CON, n = 185), and subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n = 74). We assessed a large sample from 6 sites in the United States and South Africa, using standardized methodology. Data were analyzed using 3 latent profile analyses including (i) subjects with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and controls, (ii) subjects with AE without FAS and controls, and (iii) subjects with AE (with or without FAS) and subjects with ADHD. Results: Classification accuracy was moderate but significant across the 3 analyses. In analysis 1, overall classification accuracy was 76.1% (77.2% FAS, 75.7% CON). In the second analysis, overall classification accuracy was 71.5% (70.1% AE/non-FAS, 72.4% CON). In the third analysis, overall classification accuracy was 73.9% (59.8% AE, 75.7% ADHD). Subjects that were misclassified were examined for systematic differences from those that were correctly classified. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the neuropsychological effects of AE are clinically meaningful and can be used to accurately distinguish alcohol-affected children from both typically developing children and children with ADHD. Further, in combination with other recent studies, these data suggest that approximately 70% of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure are neurobehaviorally affected, while the remaining 30% are spared these often-devastating consequences, at least those in the domains under study. Refining the neurobehavioral profile will allow improved identification and treatment development for children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objective: Classic facial characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) are shortened palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, and thin upper vermillion. We aim to help pediatricians detect facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum, especially among nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) individuals without classic facial characteristics. Methods: Of 192 Cape Coloured children recruited, 69 were born to women who reported abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy. According to multifaceted criteria, the remainder were allocated clinically to the FAS (n = 22), partial FAS (n = 26) or nonsyndromal HE (n = 75) categories. We used dense surface modeling and signature analyses of 3-dimensional facial photographs to determine agreement between clinical categorization and classifications induced from face shape alone, to visualize facial differences, and to consider predictive links between face shape and neurobehavior. Results: Face classification achieved significant agreement with clinical categories for discrimination of nonexposed from FAS alone (face: 0.97-1.00; profile: 0.92) or with the addition of partial FAS (face: 0.90; profile: 0.92). Visualizations of face signatures delineated dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum and in half of the nonsyndromal HE category face signature graphs detected facial characteristics consistent with prenatal alcohol exposure. This subgroup performed less well on IQ and learning tests than did nonsyndromal subjects without classic facial characteristics. Conclusions: Heat maps and morphing visualizations of face signatures may help clinicians detect facial dysmorphism across the fetal alcohol spectrum. Face signature graphs show potential for identifying nonsyndromal heavily exposed children who lack the classic facial phenotype but have cognitive impairment.

N2  - Genetic factors are involved in variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which is also observed among various inbred mouse strains. The CD1 mouse strain is often used in toxicological and genetic experiments. However, there is little literature using this strain to study long-term neurologic abnormalities of FASD. In the present study, we addressed the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on neurological alterations in adult CD1 mice. The female CD1 mice received exposure to ethanol solution (10 vol%) starting from 2 weeks before mating up to pups born (postnatal day 1). At 24 weeks after the birth, the prenatal ethanol-exposed mice and control mice showed no difference in spatial learning and memory performance in a Morris water maze. Consistently, pathological changes, such as increased neuronal apoptosis, decreased synaptic protein synaptophysin expression, synaptic loss and reactive astrogliosis, were not observed in the hippocampus of mice prenatally exposed to ethanol. These results suggest that CD1 mice are highly resistant to prenatal alcohol exposure and may serve as genetic modification models of FASD. Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy remains a common occurrence and is associated with a multitude of adverse birth and long-term outcomes. Binge drinking in particular is shown to be particularly harmful to the developing fetus. Effects include full fetal alcohol syndrome, with characteristic facial dysmorphology, growth restriction, and developmental to delays. Exposed children may also have partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related birth defects, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. These effects are preventable, and efforts must begin with accurate identification of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. Several screening tools have been developed and validated for use in prenatal care settings, and the most recently proposed brief and easy to use T-ACER3 has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in both identifying risk drinking during pregnancy and predicting long-term neurobehavioral outcomes in exposed children. Once identified, effective interventions are available for use with pregnant women consuming alcohol. Brief interventions, which can be delivered by a health professional and involve motivational interviewing, have been demonstrated to significantly reduce alcohol consumption during pregnancy. These approaches, recommended by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG), help move patients toward increased readiness to positively change their drinking behavior. Ultimately, all prenatal care providers should routinely screen all patients for alcohol use using validated tools, and where appropriate, should offer intervention. © 2013, Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.

N2  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading cause of preventable intellectual disabilities in the United States and a significant public health issue. Objectives The purpose of this study is to evaluate the knowledge and screening practices of pre-clinical medical students and clinical providers on FAS, FASD, and alcohol consumption. Methods A short survey sent to medical students and residents on the campus of a large medical school and university hospital. Results On the survey of clinical providers, 38% of respondents stated they always survey pregnant women about their alcohol consumption, 34% stated they always screen patients planning to get pregnant, and 9% screen women of childbearing age. There were a significant percentage of providers who never screen women. When questioned regarding safe amounts of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, 69% of preclinical medical students and 67% of clinical providers stated there is no safe amount of alcohol consumption. Clinical providers were much more likely to correctly select the facial features necessary for the diagnosis (p-value < 0.01). Conclusions Significant differences exist in the knowledge and screening practices of these different healthcare providers and trainees. Future interventions should seek to improve knowledge on FAS, FASD, and alcohol consumption, in order for practitioners to be more consistent with national guidelines and the Surgeon General recommendations. © 2013 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - The characteristics of fetal acohol spectrum disorders (FASD) constitute a specific facial phenotype, growth failure and neurodevelopmental defects. Reported FASD prevalences vary widely from 0.08 per 1,000 up to 68.0-89.2 per 1,000. We aimed to evaluate to which extent children referred with a suspicion of FASD, indeed have FASD. We included all 27 children referred to our genetic department with a suspicion of FASD between 2005 and 2010. Nineteen children (70.3%) were of non-Dutch ancestry, and 24 (88.9%) had been adopted. We used both the 4-Digit Code and the Revised Institute of Medicine criteria. More than half of the children did not meet either criteria for the diagnosis of FASD. Of note, after evaluation 8/27 children appeared not to have confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure. Two children referred for suspicion of FASD (neither of which were exposed to alcohol or met the criteria for FASD) had a pathogenic microstructural chromosomal rearrangement (del16p11.2 of 542KB and dup1q44 of 915KB). In 22/24 children (91.7%) there were other factors that may have affected their intellectual abilities, such as familial intellectual disability and social deprivation. We recommend a critical approach towards the diagnosis FASD, and to investigate all patients suspected to have FASD for other causative factors including genetic abnormalities. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can have serious and permanent adverse effects. The developing brain is the most vulnerable organ to the insults of prenatal alcohol exposure. A behavioral phenotype of prenatal alcohol exposure including conduct disorders is also described. This study on a sample of Brazilian adolescents convicted for criminal behavior aimed to evaluate possible clinical features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). These were compared to a control group of school adolescents, as well as tested for other environmental risk factors for antisocial behavior. A sample of 262 institutionalized male adolescents due to criminal behavior and 154 male students aged between 13 and 21 years comprised the study population. Maternal use of alcohol was admitted by 48.8% of the mothers of institutionalized adolescents and by 39.9% of the school students. In this sample of adolescents we could not identify individual cases with a clear diagnosis of FAS, but signs suggestive of FASD were more common in the institutionalized adolescents. Social factors like domestic and family violence were frequent in the risk group, this also being associated to maternal drinking during pregnancy. The inference is that in our sample, criminal behavior is more related to complex interactions between environmental and social issues including prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure leads to widespread cognitive deficits, including problems with spatial working memory (SWM). Neuroimaging studies report structural and functional abnormalities in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), but interpretations may be complicated by the co-occurrence of a family history of alcoholism. Since this history is also linked to cognitive deficits and brain abnormalities, it is difficult to determine the extent to which deficits are unique to prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Age-matched subjects selected from 2 neuroimaging studies underwent functional imaging while engaging in a task assessing memory for spatial locations relative to a vigilance condition assessing attention. Pairwise comparisons were made for the following 3 groups: children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 18); those with no prenatal alcohol exposure, but a confirmed family history of alcoholism (FHP, n = 18); and nonexposed, family history negative controls (CON, n = 17). Results: Relative to CON and FHP, the ALC group showed increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left middle and superior frontal gyri for the SWM condition relative to the vigilance condition (SWM contrast). Additionally, the ALC group showed unique BOLD response increases in the left lingual gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus relative to CON, and left cuneus and precuneus relative to FHP. Both ALC and FHP showed greater activation compared to CON in the lentiform nucleus and insular region. Conclusions: These results confirm previous studies suggesting SWM deficits in FASD. Differences between the ALC group and the CON and FHP groups suggest the left middle and superior frontal region may be specifically affected in alcohol-exposed children. Conversely, differences from the CON group in the lentiform nucleus and insular region for the ALC and FHP groups may indicate this region is associated with family history of alcoholism rather than specifically with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol affects 1 in 100 births in the United States resulting in neurodevelopmental and learning abnormalities. Development of the nervous system, including myelination and differentiation, are dependent on soluble and membrane bound receptors. Alterations in these may underlie abnormal development due to in-utero alcohol exposure. Prenatal therapy with neuropeptides (NAP + SAL) prevents some of the developmental and behavioral abnormalities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of alcohol and NAP + SAL in cellular signaling pathways. STUDY DESIGN: We used the well characterized Webster mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnancy was identified by vaginal plug and treatment with alcohol (0.03mL/kg IP), alcohol+NAP+SAL (20fxg IP) or control (saline) was administered on gestational day 8. Embryos were harvested after 30 minutes, 60 minutes or 10 days. MAP kinase, SRC and STAT cell signaling pathways were studied using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Milli-pore) and normalized to total protein concentration. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with Fishers post hoc for multiple comparisons; P<.05 significant. RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol increased phosphorylation of JNK in the embryo at 30 and 60min compared with controls (both P<0.01). Pretreatment with NAP+SAL returned levels to control at 60min (Figure). Similarly alcohol increased phosphorylation ofp38 at 30min and NAP + SAL returned levels to control. These findings persisted at 10 days. No differences were found in the phosphorylation of ERK. The levels at these timepoints were undetectable for the SRC and STAT pathways. CONCLUSION: Phosphorylation of the JNK andp38 cell signaling pathways are affected by alcohol exposure in pregnancy. Targeting cell signaling pathways, such as with NAP+SAL, should have a significant impact on prevention of alcohol-induced abnormalities. (Graph Presented).

N2  - The relationship between maternal drinking during pregnancy and low birth weight and birth defects is expressed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the corresponding studies have not been conducted in Japan. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of alcohol and tobacco use by both mothers and fathers on the development of newborn babies and infants in Japan. This study was conducted in Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan, with collaboration with all municipal health centers in the city. The questionnaires were delivered to all parents present at health checkups for their four-month old infants, and replies were returned by post. The questionnaire included questions about infants at birth and at four months of age, related to development status, weight and height, and it also included questions about parents, related to age, physical condition, flushing history, medical history, smoking history, passive smoking, and drinking patterns before and after pregnancy ( drinking patterns of fathers were examined only before pregnancy ). Total number of replies was 3,689 of 30,600 subjects and 27 subjects were excluded due to multiple births. Compared with the national average, the average birth weight and height of our subjects were almost the same, and the physiques of the infants were related with the number of pregnancies and births, period of gestation and parents' height and weight. The maternal smoking rate was 18.3% (prepregnancy), 7.0% (less than 16 weeks of pregnancy) and 4.9%( more than 16 weeks of pregnancy). The corresponding rates of maternal drinking were 59.4%, 25.3% and 15.7%. Paternal drinking and smoking were not related to the development of newborn infants and babies. Maternal smoking history during pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights. Infants delivered by mothers who had drunk daily during pregnancy tended to show low birth weights, but it was not significant. However, maternal heavy drinking after 16 weeks of pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights, small heads, even after correction of parents' age and height, number of pregnancies and period of gestation, and maternal smoking history. Smoking and heavy drinking by mothers may disturb the development of infants of general population in Japan.

N2  - Background: Recent studies have shown significant white matter abnormalities in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is capable of identifying subtle microstructural abnormalities in white matter - including in the absence of gross structural anomalies. Our previous work has revealed that corpus callosum abnormalities in FASD are associated with measurable disturbances in inter-hemispheric functional connectivity. The current study extends these findings in an examination of whole-brain functional connectivity using graph-theory analysis of resting fMRI data. Methods: High resolution anatomical, 30-direction DTI, and 6-minute eyes-closed restingstate fMRI data were obtained on a Siemens Tim Trio 3T scanner from 24 children (ages 10-17) with FASD and 31 matched control subjects. All children were evaluated and diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician using the University of Washington 4-digit diagnostic system. Neurocognitive evaluations, including the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WISC-IV / WAIS-IV), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT / CVLT-C) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) were also obtained. MRI data were pre-processed with the 1000-functional-connectome protocol. fMRI data were subjected to regression against whole-brain signal, white matter, CSF, and motion. Susceptibility artifacts in the fMRI data were corrected with field maps. Anatomical data were parsed with FreeSurfer and ROIs were applied to the fMRI data. The matrix of correlations of resting fMRI signal from 60 cortical ROIs was examined with graph theory analyses. Results: Overall network efficiency was significantly lower in FASD vs. controls as evidenced by higher mean path length in FASD (p=.038) and lower global efficiency (p=.042) in FASD. There were also trend-level indications of abnormalities in localized processing including higher mean clustering coefficient (p=.066) and higher local efficiency (p=.096) in FASD. None of the four network indices was correlated with IQ, but significant correlations were observed between path length and global executive functioning on the BRIEF (r=.41, p = .048). Global efficiency and path length were also correlated to initial learning (trial 1) on the CVLT. Conclusions: The results from this study of whole-brain functional connectivity are consistent with previous studies, including our own, that suggest significant abnormities in brain networks among children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Measures of network function were found to correlate significantly with cognitive functioning including memory and executive control. Whole-brain functional connectivity measures have the potential to serve as an index of level of functional brain impairment and also to serve as measures of change - change over development and change with intervention.

N2  - Neurons containing proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptides, known to control stress axis, metabolic and immune functions, have a lower function in patients with a family history of alcoholism, raising the possibility that alcohol effects on the POMC system may transmit through generations. In this study we investigated whether prenatal ethanol alters DNA methylation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, and also whether the methylation changes in the proximal POMC promoter can be transmitted transgenerationally. The rat POMC gene contains a 5' CpG island that surrounds the POMC transcription start site. Detailed characterization of POMC DNA methylation revealed that there were fetal alcohol-induced changes in methylation that resulted in hypermethylation of proximal POMC promoter in adulthood, even though the exposure to ethanol ended at GD 21. A transgenerational study was conducted by mating male and female rats (F1) prenatally exposed to alcohol or a control diet for three generations. The proximal POMC promoter in the F1 and F2 animals was significantly hypermethylated in comparison to the control group, and the POMC gene expression level was decreased in both male and female progenies. However, in the F3 generation only male offspring of the exposed animals demonstrated a significant increase in DNA methylation level with the concomitant drop in POMC gene expression. Additionally, hypermethylated POMC gene was detected in sperm of fetal alcohol exposed F1 through F3 male germline. The germline transmission of POMC gene methylation was also correlated with altered stress axis response. Thus, our data highlight the novel possibility that epigenetic changes contribute to the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on POMC gene expression, as well as, the perpetuation of abnormal POMC neuronal functions through subsequent generations via the male, possibly through Y-chromosome. The results also shed light on the sexdependent difference in the genetic risk of alcohol dependence.

N2  - Purpose : Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders refers to a constellation of physical, psychological and emotional deficits that affect children of mothers who used alcohol during pregnancy, the most serious of which is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, or FAS. Although, Asian countries were known to have lower prevalence of alcohol drinking and alcohol dependence, currently those among women has been increasing very fast. In Korea, the rate of past month drinking among women has been increasing from 32% to 80%(1989 - 2007). This trend was prominent especially in childbearing age group. Therefore, it was expected that there might be substantial risk of development of FASD in Korea. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of FASD in Korea. Method : We used active case ascertainment approach to raise the possibility of detecting FASD case. We visited 8 institutes where the kids with mental retardation were committed and 13 general elimentary school. In primary screening process, 307 kids were screened by height and weight. 97 Kids whose height or weight are under 10 percentile were selected for facial dysmorphologic examination in institution. In addition, in general school setting, 7,785 kids were screened, and dysmorphologic examination were performed in 231 kids. Results : Among kids in instiution 13 kids(14%) were diagnosed by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, while 40(43%) kids were found to be group with deferred diagnosed by FAS. Further among kids in general school, 40 kids(0.51%) were diagnosed by FAS according to dysmorphology core criteria by CIFASD, while 14 kids(0.18%) were diagnosed by FAS according to Canaidian diagnosis guidelines. Conclusion : In conclusion, as we used active case ascertainment approach to higher risk group and general population, we could find the relatively higher rate of FAS. In order to estimate the general prevalence of FASD, the expanded epidemiologic survey on FASD in general population and alcohol exposure in perinatal clinic are needed.

N2  - Purpose of the Study: The relationship between maternal drinking during pregnancy and low birth weight and birth defects is expressed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the corresponding studies have not been conducted in Japan. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of alcohol and tobacco use by both mothers and fathers on the development of newborn babies and infants in Japan. Method: This study was conducted in Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan, with collaboration with all municipal health centers in the city. The questionnaires were delivered to all parents present at health checkups for their four-month old infants, and replies were returned by post. The questionnaire included questions about infants at birth and at four months of age, related to development status, weight and height, and it also included questions about parents, related to age, physical condition, flushing history, medical history, smoking history, passive smoking, and drinking patterns before and after pregnancy ( drinking patterns of fathers were examined only before pregnancy ). Results: Total number of replies was 3,689 of 30,600 subjects and 27 subjects were excluded due to multiple births. Compared with the national average, the average birth weight and height of our subjects were almost the same, and the physiques of the infants were related with the number of pregnancies and births, period of gestation and parents' height and weight. The maternal smoking rate was 18.3% (prepregnancy), 7.0% (less than 16 weeks of pregnancy) and 4.9%( more than 16 weeks of pregnancy). The corresponding rates of maternal drinking were 59.4%, 25.3% and 15.7%. Paternal drinking and smoking were not related to the development of newborn infants and babies. Maternal smoking history during pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights. Infants delivered by mothers who had drunk daily during pregnancy tended to show low birth weights, but it was not significant. However, maternal heavy drinking after 16 weeks of pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weights, small heads, even after correction of parents' age and height, number of pregnancies and period of gestation, and maternal smoking history. Conclusion: Smoking and heavy drinking by mothers may disturb the development of infants of general population in Japan.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the most debilitating outcome of an alcoholexposed pregnancy (AEP) associated with heavy maternal drinking; alcohol consumption at lower levels can result in a range of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). No safe amount of alcohol or time during pregnancy has been identified, including early in pregnancy when a woman may not know she is pregnant. A combination of at-risk drinking with the possibility of becoming pregnant constitutes significant risk for AEP. The risk is prevalent among Russian women and developing OBGYN clinic-based brief interventions (BI) that target both risky alcohol consumption and lack of contraception is promising for preventing FASD. Methods: This study is a two-arm, site-randomized clinical trial testing a BI designed to reduce the AEP risk among childbearing age women. Women were recruited for the study at 20 district OBGYN clinics in two locations, representing a major urban population of St. Petersburg (SPB) and a more rural population of the Nizhny Novgorod Region (NNR). Clinics were randomized to intervention or control/services as usual conditions. The intervention was based on BI guidelines (Barbor & Higgins-Biddle, 1992; Whitlock et al. 2004) and evidence-based FASD prevention interventions, Healthy Moms (Fleming et al., 2008) and Project CHOICES (Floyd et al., 2007). The dual-focused brief physician intervention (DFBPI) was designed to be deliverable by OBGYN physicians at women's clinics. The intervention consisted of two face-to-face, structured, 5-minute sessions incorporated in clinic visits scheduled approximately one month apart. Follow-up assessments were at 3, 6, and 12-months. A total of 1,914 childbearing age women were screened and women at risk for AEP,( i.e., had intercourse without effective contraception and consumed four or more drinks on any occasion or eight or more than drinks per week) were recruited for the study (n=764), including 404 women at-risk in SPB and 360 in NNR. Results: Binge drinking was prevalent among women at both study locations; NNR women reported less effective contraceptive use. Physicians incorporated the intervention into clinic visits and maintained intervention skills. Preliminary findings: Both groups reduced alcohol consumption- 68% in the intervention group and 64% in control group at 3 month follow-up. Compared to the control group, larger proportions of women in the intervention condition reported reduced alcohol consumption at 6 month (71% vs 61%) and 12 month follow up (69 vs 56%). Conclusions: Results support the feasibility of the DFBPI at OBGYN clinics in Russia.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to induce fetal brain growth deficits at different embryonic stages. We focused this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects against alcohol-induced apoptosis at midgestation using activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF)-9, a peptide (SALLRSIPA) derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor, and NAP, a peptide (NAPVSIPQ) derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein. We used an established fetal alcohol exposure mouse model. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet (ALC) group with 25 % (4.49 %, v/v) ethanol-derived calories, (2) pair-fed (PF) control group, (3) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9) group, (4) ALC combined with i.p. injections (1.5 mg/kg) of NAP (ALC/NAP) group, (5) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of ADNF-9 (PF/ADNF-9) group, and (6) PF liquid diet combined with i.p. injections of NAP (PF/NAP) group. On day 15 (E15), fetal brains were collected, weighed, and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. ADNF-9 or NAP was administered daily from E7 to E15 alongside PF or ALC liquid diet exposure. Our results show that NAP and ADNF-9 significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of fetal brains. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP or ADNF-9 administration alongside alcohol exposure significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium of the cingulate cortex and ganglionic eminence. These findings may pave the path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during pregnancy stages. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Objective: In humans, antenatal alcohol exposure elicits various developmental disorders, in particular in the brain. Numerous studies focus on the deleterious effects of alcohol on neural cells. Although recent studies suggest that alcohol can affect angiogenesis in adults, the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on brain microvasculature remains poorly understood. Methods: We used a mouse model to investigate effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the cortical microvascular network in vivo and ex vivo and the action of alcohol, glutamate, and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) on activity, plasticity, and survival of microvessels. We used quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, calcimetry, and videomicroscopy. We characterized the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the cortical microvascular network in human controls and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (pFAS) patients at different developmental stages. Results: In mice, prenatal alcohol exposure induced a reduction of cortical vascular density, loss of the radial orientation of microvessels, and altered expression of VEGF receptors. Time-lapse experiments performed on brain slices revealed that ethanol inhibited glutamate-induced calcium mobilization in endothelial cells, affected plasticity, and promoted death of microvessels. These effects were prevented by VEGF. In humans, we evidenced a stage-dependent alteration of the vascular network in the cortices of fetuses with pFAS/FAS. Whereas no modification was observed from gestational week 20 (WG20) to WG22, the radial organization of cortical microvessels was clearly altered in pFAS/FAS patients from WG30 to WG38. Interpretation: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects cortical angiogenesis both in mice and in pFAS/FAS patients, suggesting that vascular defects contribute to alcohol-induced brain abnormalities.

N2  - Studies in rat models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders have indicated that the cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to ethanol-induced Purkinje cell loss during the third trimester-equivalent, with striking regional differences in vulnerability in which early-maturing regions in the vermis show significantly more loss than the late-maturing regions. The current study tested the hypothesis that the sheep model will show similar regional differences in fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell loss when prenatal binge ethanol exposure is restricted to the prenatal period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester and also compared the pattern of loss to that produced by exposure during the first trimester-equivalent. Pregnant Suffolk sheep were assigned to four groups: first trimester-equivalent saline control group, first trimester-equivalent ethanol group (1.75. g/kg/day), third trimester-equivalent saline control group, and third trimester-equivalent ethanol group (1.75. g/kg/day). Ethanol was administered as an intravenous infusion on 3 consecutive days followed by a 4-day ethanol-free interval, to mimic a weekend binge drinking pattern. Animals from all four groups were sacrificed and fetal brains were harvested on gestation day 133. Fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell counts were performed in an early-maturing region (lobules I-X) and a late-maturing region (lobules VIc-VII) from mid-sagittal sections of the cerebellar vermis. As predicted, the third trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure caused a significant reduction in the fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell volume density and Purkinje cell number in the early-maturing region, but not in the late-maturing region. In contrast, the first trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure resulted in significant reductions in both the early and late-maturing regions. These data confirmed that the previous findings in rat models that third trimester-equivalent prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in regionally-specific Purkinje cell loss in the early-maturing region of the vermis, and further demonstrated that first trimester ethanol exposure caused more generalized fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, independent of the cerebellar vermal region. These findings support the idea that prenatal ethanol exposure in the first trimester interferes with the genesis of Purkinje cells in an unselective manner, whereas exposure during the third trimester selectively kills post-mitotic Purkinje cells in specific vermal regions during a vulnerable period of differentiation and synaptogenesis. © 2012.

N2  - Background Alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) falls under the umbrella of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), but individuals do not demonstrate the facial characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), making diagnosis difficult. While attentional problems in ARND are similar to those found in attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the underlying impairment in attention pathways may be different. Methods Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a working memory (1-back) task of 63 children, 10 to 14 years old, diagnosed with ARND and ADHD, as well as typically developing (TD) controls, was conducted at 3 T. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were also acquired. Results Activations were observed in posterior parietal and occipital regions in the TD group and in dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal regions in the ARND group, whereas the ADHD group activated only dorsolateral prefrontal regions, during the working memory component of the task (1-back minus 0-back contrast). The increases in frontal and parietal activity were significantly greater in the ARND group compared to the other groups. This increased activity was associated with reduced accuracy and increased response time variability, suggesting that ARND subjects exert greater effort to manage short-term memory load. Significantly greater intra-subject variability, demonstrated by fMRI region-of-interest analysis, in the ADHD and ARND groups compared to the TD group suggests that momentto- moment lapses in attention contributed to their poorer task performance. Differences in functional activity in ARND subjects with and without a diagnosis of ADHD resulted primarily from reduced activation by the ARND/ADHD + group during the 0-back task. In contrast, children with ADHD alone clearly showed reduced activations during the 1-back task. DTI analysis revealed that the TD group had significantly higher total tract volume and number of fibers than the ARND group. These measures were negatively correlated with errors on the 1-back task, suggesting a link between white matter integrity and task performance. Conclusions fMRI activations suggest that the similar behavior of children with ARND and ADHD on a spatial working memory task is the result of different cognitive events. The nature of ADHD in children with ARND appears to differ from that of children with ADHD alone. © 2012 Malisza et al.

N2  - Background: A derived peptide from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) has been shown to be neuroprotective in the fetal alcohol exposure model. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 against alcohol-induced apoptosis using TUNEL staining. We further characterize in this study the proteomic architecture underlying the role of ADNF-9 against ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Methods. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic days 7-13 (E7-E13) to a 25% ethanol-derived calorie [25% EDC, Alcohol (ALC)] diet, a 25% EDC diet simultaneously administered i.p. ADNF-9 (ALC/ADNF-9), or a pair-fed (PF) liquid diet. At E13, fetal brains were collected from 5 dams from each group, weighed, and frozen for LC-MS/MS procedure. Other fetal brains were fixed for TUNEL staining. Results: Administration of ADNF-9 prevented alcohol-induced reduction in fetal brain weight and alcohol-induced increases in cell death. Moreover, individual fetal brains were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Statistical differences in the amounts of proteins between the ALC and ALC/ADNF-9 groups resulted in a distinct data-clustering. Significant upregulation of several important proteins involved in brain development were found in the ALC/ADNF-9 group as compared to the ALC group. Conclusion: These findings provide information on potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9 in the fetal alcohol exposure model. © 2011 Sari et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: Studies of the adverse neurobehavioral effects of maternal alcohol consumption on the fetus have been largely confined to the postnatal period, after exposure to alcohol has finished. This study explored the brain function of the fetus, at the time of exposure to alcohol, to examine its effect on information processing and stability of performance. Methods: Five groups of fetuses, defined by maternal alcohol consumption patterns, were examined: control (no alcohol); moderate (5 to 10 units/wk either drunk evenly across the week or as a binge, in 2 to 3 days); heavy (20+ units/wk drunk evenly or as a binge). Fetal habituation performance was examined on 3 occasions, separated by 7 days, beginning at 35 weeks of gestation. The number of trials required to habituate on each test session and the difference in performance across test sessions were recorded. Results: Fetuses exposed to heavy binge drinking required significantly more trials to habituate and exhibited a greater variability in performance across all test sessions than the other groups. Maternal drinking, either heavily but evenly or moderately as a binge, resulted in poorer habituation, and moderate binge drinking resulted in greater variability compared with no, or even, drinking. Conclusions: Decreased information processing, reflected by poorer habituation, and increased variability in performance may reflect the initial manifestations of structural damage caused by alcohol to the brain. These results will lead to a greater understanding of the effects of alcohol on the fetus's brain, enable the antenatal identification of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and lead to the early implementation of better management strategies. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Introduction: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has been identified as significant medical and public health problem. Many studies have reported morphologic characteristics and long-term disabilities. However neurodevelopment of early infancy has been rarely described. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Cheil General Hospital Mother Risk Program. In total 236 pregnant women participated in the research and filled out TWEAK questionnaire. After delivery and 12 months postpartum, offspring5 were examined and mothers were interviewed. Meconium was collected to measure fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) in their offspring5. 106 babies being over 10 months of age were performed the physically examined and Bayley scales of infant and Toddler Development III (BSID-III) were performed. We compared the growth (height, weight, and head circumference), morphological characteristics (palpebral fissure length and philtrum grade) and BSID-III results between maternal alcohol drinking group and non-drinking group. Results: The overall rate of alcohol drinking more than once during pregnancy was 55% (66/120). In maternal alcohol drinking group, TWEAK positive rate was 38% (25/66) and FAEE positive rate was 24% (8/33). One child was diagnosed as foetal alcohol syndrome. For the growth, children in the maternal alcohol drinking group showed less growth rate, shorter palpebral fissure length, higher philtrum grade and lower BSID-III score than in the nondrinking group however statistical difference was not significant. Conclusion: Offspring of women drinking alcohol had tendency of delayed neurodevelopment but that was not prominent in early infancy. Development test alone could not be a diagnostic tool for FASD without distinctive FAS morphology.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The indications of brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in fetal alcohol syndrome are not clearly defined, even though the condition is recognized as one of the most common causes of mental retardation. This article reports a case of a 9-year-old adopted girl with developmental delay, mildly dysmorphic facial features, and behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. Extensive investigations including genetic studies and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormalities, and a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome was considered since official diagnostic criteria were met. A brain SPECT was requested and showed severely decreased tracer activity in the thalami, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes on both sides, the overall findings being consistent with the established diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. With increasing availability of functional brain imaging, the study indications and possible ethical implications in suspected prenatal alcohol exposure or even before adoption need further consideration. In this patient, SPECT was the only test to yield positive results. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - Objective: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these alterations. Study Design: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after 6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P <.05 considered significant. Results: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9; range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P <.003), similar to the controls. Alcohol exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (P <.003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1beta were decreased 6 hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-, and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of the groups. Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Background: Observational studies have generated conflicting evidence on the effects of moderate maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy on offspring cognition mainly reflecting problems of confounding. Among mothers who drink during pregnancy fetal alcohol exposure is influenced not only by mother's intake but also by genetic variants carried by both the mother and the fetus. Associations between children's cognitive function and both maternal and child genotype at these loci can shed light on the effects of maternal alcohol consumption on offspring cognitive development. Methods: We used a large population based study of women recruited during pregnancy to determine whether genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes in this cohort of women and their children were related to the child's cognitive score (measured by the Weschler Intelligence Scale) at age 8. Findings: We found that four genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes in 4167 children were strongly related to lower IQ at age 8, as was a risk allele score based on these 4 variants. This effect was only seen amongst the offspring of mothers who were moderate drinkers (1-6 units alcohol per week during pregnancy (per allele effect estimates were -1.80 (95% CI = -2.63 to -0.97) p = 0.00002, with no effect among children whose mothers abstained during pregnancy (0.16 (95%CI = -1.05 to 1.36) p = 0.80), p-value for interaction = 0.009). A further genetic variant associated with alcohol metabolism in mothers was associated with their child's IQ, but again only among mothers who drank during pregnancy. © 2012 Lewis et al.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Objective: To determine to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta. Methods: Placentae (n=4) from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto were taken to the on-site perfusion laboratory. After cannulation and establishment of dual circulation, 1 mcg/mL EtG was added to the maternal reservoir and samples were taken throughout the 3h experiment. Measurements of placental viability were oxygen transfer, pH, glucose consumption, hCG production, fetal reservoir volume, and fetal arterial inflow pressure. EtG was analyzed in perfusate samples and placental tissue by GC-MS after solid phase extraction. Results: After 3h, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 0.30 +/- 0.02 and net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring. Triplicate averages of EtG concentrations in perfused placental lobules ranged from 140-414 ng/g. Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all perfusions. Conclusions: EtG appears to cross the human placenta and, hence, to represent both maternal and fetal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) are both validated biomarkers of chronic excessive alcohol consumption in hair. One of the most promising clinical applications of alcohol hair analysis is to identify infants as risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) by assessing maternal ethanol consumption; however, studies on FAEE and EtG hair analysis to determine alcohol abuse have been primarily conducted in male populations. Previous studies have indicated that the use of ethanol containing hair-care products may elevate FAEE concentrations in hair, providing a potential source of bias in the use of this biomarker in female populations. This study examines individuals undergoing hair analysis under suspicion of chronic alcohol abuse in child safety investigations. METHODS: A total of 207 hair specimens were analyzed for both FAEE and EtG, approximately 70% of all samples were from female donors. Onehundred fifty-eight samples were blindly assessed for both biomarkers; n = 49 additional samples were analyzed for EtG following positive FAEE analysis. Cut-off values of 0.50 ng/mg-FAEE and 25 pg/mg-EtG were applied to determine chronic excessive alcohol consumption. Hair samples were pre-washed to remove external contamination and analyzed for FAEE and EtG by GC-MS using deuterated internal standards. RESULTS: A higher rate of correspondence was found between FAEE and EtG levels amongst male (71%) over female (28%) subjects. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a gender bias exists making determination of chronic excessive alcohol use challenging in female subjects. The source of this bias is likely cosmetic hair treatments; with ethanol-containing hair products producing false-positive FAEE findings and hair bleaching/colouring possibly producing falsenegative EtG results contributing to a greater discordance amongst samples of female origin.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Although receiving services for developmental disabilities is a strong protective factor against negative outcomes in FASD, there is little research on service utilization patterns among individuals with FASD. The goal of the current study was to examine rates of service utilization among children with FASD and those with confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) without an FASD diagnosis. Service utilization patterns were compared across diagnostic group, diagnostic assessment before age six vs. after age six, and residential location (urban vs. rural). Methods: Caregivers of 46 children with FASD and 26 with PAE were interviewed using the Services for Children and Adolescents Parent Interview (SCAPI). The SCAPI collects information about child medication, individual child therapy, parent/family therapy, education services, parenting classes/groups, and parent medication. Questions about respite and early intervention were added. Results: The most frequently used services among both diagnostic groups were education services, child medication, child therapy, and parenting classes. The groups differed in access to educational support (accessed more by FASD) and parenting classes/groups (accessed more by PAE). Children assessed before age 6 had better service access than those diagnosed later in areas of early intervention, parent/family therapy, and parent medication whereas a greater proportion of those diagnosed after age 6 accessed respite. Service access did not differ between urban and rural participants. Conclusions: An FASD diagnosis instead of just confirmed PAE does not generally seem to increase overall rates of service utilization. Furthermore, geographic location has little effect on service utilization. However, being diagnosed before age six appears to be associated with better service access.

N2  - Objectives: As part of population-based prevalence study of FASD in the Lazio Province of Italy, researchers conducted in-depth maternal interviews with mothers of all cohort subjects (n=976). The objective was to examine and better define the maternal risk factors of the mothers who produce children with an FASD. Materials & Methods: Lazio contains the city of Rome and the study area is characterized by small and medium sized towns and rural areas. The study consisted of two waves of dysmorphology screening, child testing, and interviews of mothers all with affected children and controls from first grade classes and their mothers. Results: Analysis of the maternal demographic and drinking characteristics of mothers of children with FASD, mothers of randomly-selected controls, and community mothers of other first grade children provided many statistically significant results including height and body mass index (BMI) differences, with mothers of the FASD children being the shortest (F = 5.95, p =.003), and having the highest BMI (F = 3.45, p = .032). Mothers of FASD children report the highest lifetime alcohol consumption (X2 = 7.85, p = .020), as well as more drinks consumed per month (F = 10.72, p = .000), and in the past week (F = 8.27, p = .000) at the time of interview. In addition, total drinks consumed per week three months before pregnancy is significantly higher for mothers of children with FASD (F = 5.03, p = .007), as is the percentage of that group who report consuming three drinks or more per occasion during pregnancy (e.g., binge drinking; X2 = 5.70, p = .058). Correlations illustrate the importance of maternal demographic (e.g., mother's occupation and monthly income) and other drinking variables (e.g., variety of alcohol types consumed, total number drinks consumed per week three months before pregnancy, binge drinking), as they correlate significantly with child physical traits that are key to FASD diagnoses, In addition, paternal and family variables are examined, including reported alcohol problems in the child's family and father's legal problems, both of which differ significantly by group (FASD, Control, and Community; X2 = 11.74, p = .003 and X2 = 8.03, p = .018, respectively), with the greatest problems in the FASD group. Conclusion: Maternal risk factors for FASD in Italy have been better defined by this study, and the results may be relevant to other European countries.

N2  - Introduction: Ethanol consumption by pregnant women can produce severe effects in the foetus and the newborn, mainly in neurological and weight-height development, and are included in the term FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder). Questionnaires are the most used screening method to detect prenatal exposure, but a previous population study questioned its reliability. The objective of this study was to compare alcohol prenatal exposure detection by questionnaire compared with biomarkers in meconium. Materials & Methods: Sixty two meconium samples from mothers who denied alcohol consumption during pregnancy by questionnaire were analysed. The objective analysis was made by determination of FAEEs (fatty acid ethyl esters) as exposure biomarkers in meconium as biological matrix. Results: In the meconium from 10 of 62 newborns from non-alcohol consuming mothers by questionnaire (16.12%) FAEE values were positive (> 2 nmol/g). Discussion: Questionnaires as a screening method during pregnancy are not a reliable tool. It is necessary to identify prenatal exposure to alcohol as soon as possible by biomarkers analysis in biological matrices from the newborn or the mother. The early detection will allow these patients to benefit from follow up and treatment to reach the best possible neurological development.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this systematic report was to review the literature regarding the attachment styles of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Materials & Methods: AMED, BNI, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, Pubmed Central, and Science Direct were systematically searched using various FASD (FASD, PAE , FAS, FAE) terminologies alongside the keyword of attachment. Papers were also checked manually against records. Results: The systematic searches yielded a mere eight articles and two dissertation abstracts dated from 1987 to 2009. Only two articles were found that addressed a specific FASD condition; which reported no effects upon the child's attachment. Five studies argued for an association between prenatal alcohol exposure and insecurity of attachment in offspring, one reported infrequent effects of alcohol on attachment, whereas the remaining two found no significant relationship; with one article contesting that any differences in attachment may be explained by low-quality care instead. All of the articles suffered from methodological issues including sample size, choice of measures and control of confounding variables; however the specific variable of intellectual functioning, which is commonly damaged within suffers of FASD, was not appropriately considered. Studies into attachment within children diagnosed with disorders that are frequently co-morbid with FASD, such as ADHD and ASD, may help to shed the light on the effects of FASD. Conclusions: With many children born to alcohol addicted mothers being taken into care or experiencing neglect the lack of research and high prevalence within this group of neurodevelopmental disorders, further research is required to understand attachment styles in children with FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Early diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is essential for the prevention of secondary problems. There are, however, strong indications that many children and adults with FASD go unrecognized and are untreated. In addition, some individuals with FASD are incorrectly diagnosed and receive the wrong treatment. This pilot study investigates to what degree FASD related behavior problems are present in children in foster care in The Netherlands. Materials & Methods: Approximately 270 Dutch foster parents will be approached to participate in our study. Data will be collected for children, aged 6 to 16, who have been in their current foster family for over 6 months. Foster parents will be asked to fill out a digital questionnaire including demographic and background variables and including two instruments that were developed to detect children with FASD. The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Questionnaire (FASQ) developed by Feldmann (Scheffner, 2011) includes 38 items presenting social, behavioral and emotional problems of children and adolescents indicative of FASD. The Neurobehavioural Screening Tool (NST; Nash, Koren, & Rovet, 2009) is based on ten questions from the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: Data collection is in progress. Parents are currently being approached and asked to complete the questionnaire. First results are expected in September 2012. Conclusion: Based on the high risk background of foster children, we expect that children in foster care show elevated levels of behavioral problems related to FASD, and that there is a significant relationship between these problems and the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy of the mother. An increased rate of such behavior problems will be a strong indication for the need for diagnosticians and foster care workers to focus more on FASD.

N2  - Objectives: The Russian Federation has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the world; however, little is known about the existing pool of research related to prenatal alcohol exposure, and particularly Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in this country. The objective of this study was to locate and review published and unpublished studies concerning any aspects related to FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure conducted in or using populations from the Russian Federation. Materials & Methods: A systematic literature search was performed simultaneously in the Russian Federation and Canada. The search was conducted in multiple (English and Russian) electronic bibliographic databases, using multiple combinations of the key words in both Russian and English. In addition, the search was conducted in several major libraries in Moscow. Results: In total, only 60 studies were identified and included in the current review: 48 studies were in Russian and 12 were in English. The examined studies can be categorized into the following four major groups: those that 1) assessed alcohol consumption during pregnancy; 2) examined Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and FASD prevalence in the general population, and/or foster homes and orphanages; 3) clinically examined children and adults and demonstrated the life-long polysystemic teratogenic effect of alcohol on the fetus; and 4) experimentally studied the teratogenic effect of alcohol on laboratory animals. The results of the studies are exceptionally alarming. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy varies from approximately 14% to 83% in various regions of the Russian Federation. Binge drinking is reported to occur in up to 21% of pregnancies. The prevalence of FAS in the general population was estimated in only one study, which reported the prevalence to be as 18-19 per 1,000 live births. This figure is approximately 20 times higher than that reported for the general population of Canada. The prevalence of FAS in orphanages for children with special needs was reported extremely high - ranging from about 427 to 680 per 1,000. Conclusion: Given the alarming prevalence rates of prenatal alcohol exposure and FASD, very little is being done in terms of research in this area within the Russian Federation. An increase in attention by the research community is urgently needed in order to improve the overall awareness of the negative consequences of consuming alcohol while pregnant, as well as the initiation of preventive measures in this country.

N2  - Objectives: Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a public health priority. FASD prevention programs can be broadly categorized into universal, selective and indicated based upon the breadth of the target population, the risk of having children with FASD, and the cost-benefit ratio of committing resources. Establishing and strengthening policies and plans for FASD prevention require an informed consideration of what is known to be effective. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the scientific literature on the effectiveness of FASD prevention on prenatal alcohol use- and FASD-related outcomes. Materials & Methods: Searches in biomedical electronic databases and the grey literature were conducted for the period from 1970 to February 2012 to identify studies (i.e., randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), observational analytical cohort studies, and uncontrolled trials) assessing universal, selective, and indicated prevention interventions targeting the broad community, pregnant women, women of childbearing age, women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) or of having a child with FASD. Results: From 3,455 references retrieved, 59 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review (Universal = 19, Selective = 30; Indicated = 10). The best scientific evidence on the effectiveness of universal FASD prevention is derived from two studies of moderate-to-weak methodological quality that evaluated a multimedia education program targeting youth in the community. Multimedia and macro-level education programs produced a statistically significant improvement in the level of knowledge regarding FASD and the effects of alcohol drinking during pregnancy. Studies assessing universal interventions such as alcohol-related warning messages, health educational activities and alcohol bans were of poor quality; and, overall, did not show that these interventions lead to significant modifications in knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of risks associated with drinking during pregnancy. Compared to universal preventive interventions, the following selective preventive interventions have a better scientific evidence base (overall strong and moderate quality) for their effectiveness: motivational interviewing, counselling activities and health education programs for women of childbearing age who consume alcohol, pregnant women, and women at risk of AEP. The scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of indicated approaches is weak and inconclusive. Conclusion: The scientific base to support the effectiveness of universal and indicated approaches for prevention of FASD is limited. Moderate evidence for selective prevention activities such as counselling, motivational interviewing and health education for pregnant women and women at risk of AEP is encouraging.

N2  - Objective: For children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) preterm birth (PTB) is frequently reported. Preterm birth may cause a variety of motor and cognitive deficits in the premature infant. The effect of preterm birth on the motor cognitive outcome in patients with FAS is unknown. Matierals & Methods: We assessed the mental and motor development of 48 children with PTB and 30 children with FAS using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II). Groups were matched for age (PTB: M = 25 months, SD = 3 months; FAS: M = 27 months, SD = 6 months). Of the children with PTB, 31 had bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or intracranial hemorrhage, 17 had no birth complications. Of the FAS children, 12 had PTB (all without birth complications). Results: In the BSID-II, PTB children without birth complications had a mean mental (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) that were close to normal (MDI = 98, PDI = 92). PTB children with birth complications had a mean MDI of 85 and a mean PDI of 81. Children with FAS had a mean MDI of 79 and a mean PDI of 80. MDI was higher in FAS children with PTB compared to FAS children without PTB (81 vs. 77). Conclusions: PTB, although frequently in FAS, seems not to contribute to the mental or motor development deficits in children with FAS. Deficits are caused predominantly by the prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Moreover, in children with FAS, PTB without complications seems to moderate the effects of PAE.

N2  - Background: Alcoholism during pregnancy is one of the most common factors in western societies causing persisting congenital and multiple physical as well as neurological impairments. Finding the diagnosis at first sight puts medical professionals into a demanding situation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect patients' developmental characteristics with the main focus on the necessity of the diagnosis itself. Patients: 125 young patients, whose diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made at the Muenster University Hospital, were followed up. Materials & Methods: Biographic details such as living conditions, health, developmental problems and educational career were gathered using a structured interview. The diagnosis itself and the impact of this on the patients were also explored. Results: Patients displayed characteristics of a less mature trait of character. The majority were looked after by foster parents. High rates of social and developmental problems could be found. The diagnosis was identified as a protective factor, with significantly better outcomes for patients being diagnosed in early childhood. A diagnosis established later in life was particularly helpful for the families and caregivers. Feelings of failure and self-blame could be diminished. Conclusions: The early detection of affected children has to be improved as receiving the correct diagnosis, despite the persistent impairments, is of major benefit for both patients and their families.

N2  - Objectives: According to a study at the Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca of Murcia, only 29% of women don't drink any alcohol in the preconception period (the most critical to the fetus). The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has announced that a low level consumption of alcohol (1 or 2 units once or twice a week) has not yet been found to be harmful to women or their babies (http://www.rcog.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1996). However, the Spanish Society of Obstetrics and Ginecology (SEGO), in cooperation with the Association of Brewers of Spain, has launched, since 2009, the educational campaign "A pregnancy without", which aims to raise awareness among pregnant women about the incompatibility of alcohol consumption during the pregnancy period, with the slogan "Because he drinks what you drink". The campaign is proposed to beer drinkers; who are pregnant; plan to become pregnant or breastfeeding, choose non-alcoholic variety. Materials & Methods: During the campaign messages are disseminated through information materials, supervised by the Spanish Ministry of Health, gynecologists across the country providing useful information about alcohol-free beer as an alternative to the traditional one and how could integrated into the habits of the pregnant woman. Additionally, the campaign also includes the dissemination of information brochure that is aimed at pregnant women that has collected various recommendations to help them follow a complete and balanced diet. In order to increase the dispread of messages among pregnant women, and society in general, there was a wide broadcasting of campaign messages in the media. Results: All members of SEGO (with 6,300 national partners) have received some information and materials on the properties of non-alcoholic beer as an alternative to traditional beer during pregnancy, emphasizing the dangers of drinking in this period. Also were distributed over 500,000 information brochure among pregnant women and women who want to be. Conclusion: This campaign is an example of good practice in prevention and public health and scientific collaboration between an association whose objective is to ensure the health and individual sectors committed to preventing cases of inadequate intake of beer. Thanks to it has been possible to achieve satisfactory results in relation to the spread, helped by the information campaign in the media where the SEGO warned of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Objectives: The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical, mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The measurement of ethylglucuronide (EtG) in alternative biological matrices, including neonatal and maternal hair, neonatal meconium, and maternal nails is receiving increasing interest for the accurate evaluation of the utero exposure to alcohol. Aims: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between EtG in maternal hair and nails with EtG in neonatal meconium to further explore the suitability of these biomarkers in disclosing prenatal exposure to ethanol. Materials & Methods: A total of 151 maternal hair strands (0-6 cm), nail clips (2-6 mm) and corresponding neonatal meconium and nails samples were obtained from neonatal wards of 4 Mediterranean public hospitals: Rome, Florence and Belluno in Italy and Barcelona in Spain. Hair, nails and meconium were analyzed for the presence of EtG by validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay. Meconium was also analyzed for the presence of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) as a complementary biomarker of in utero exposure to alcohol. Results: On the basis of the accepted cut-off for EtG and FAEEs in neonatal meconium, 18 newborns resulted in utero exposed to maternal alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, none of these cases were confirmed by the presence of EtG in maternal hair and nails, which resulted all negative to this biomarker. Conversely, one high positive result in nails (24 pg EtG/mg nail) was obtained in Pakistan woman, whose hair resulted negative to EtG likewise the meconium of her newborn. Low maternal education level was associated with biomarker scores over the cutoff. There was also a significant correlation between the highest percentage of prenatal exposure in the capital and certain maternal sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusion: Obtained results confirm that EtG and FAEEs in meconium are the best biomarker to assess in utero exposure to maternal alcohol. The 18 newborns exposed to maternal ethanol came from mothers who declared alcohol consumption through the entire pregnancy, but not on daily basis and with no more than 1 drink per day.This fact led us to suppose that firstly EtG in hair and nails is not a good biomarker to disclose an alcohol consumption lower than on daily basis and lower than one alcoholic unit per day. Secondly that both in case of hair and in that of nails, the amount of collected sample is crucial to obtain a positive result, since available methods are yet not enough sensitive for less than 20 mg keratin matrices.

N2  - Objectives: Awareness, education, and prevention are key to eliminating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which is a 100% preventable lifelong disability. The aim of this presentation is to share resources and ways that the community is being engaged in Edmonton, Canada. The main goals are to raise awareness, provide new resources, and to get conversations started so that we can put forth a clear message that no alcohol is best during pregnancy. A music video and cell phone ringtone have just been created and released in order to target youth and young adults. This video is a unique resource that is being used in various settings and has received extensive positive feedback. Prevention initiatives and a public health message will be at the forefront of this interactive presentation. Materials & Methods: A power point presentation will be used. Also, print materials will be handed out, the music video 'You Can Choose' will be shown that has been created in partnership with the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum of Services (FASS) and the Edmonton Fetal Alcohol Network (EFAN), and information will be provided on how to access the free ringtone. Results: The presentation shared resources and provided information on what new and unique tactics are being used in the Edmonton community to raise awareness about this invisible, preventable disability. Conclusion: As a community it is our responsibility to work together to raise awareness and to educate on FASD. By providing information and having an open discussion we can help to start these much needed conversations and begin to break down the stereotypes, misconceptions, and stigma associated with alcohol, pregnancy, and FASD.

N2  - Objectives: The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) was established by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol (NIAAA) in 2003 with the overall goal of improving the diagnoses of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). It is a multidisciplinary, multisite, international project combining both clinical and basic science projects. To date, CIFASD it has involved projects in seven different countries, including four in Europe. The major objective is to provide an overview and update on CIFASD, highlighting major accomplishments to date Materials & Methods: CIFASD utilizes a comprehensive approach to many of the critical questions in FASD research including improved diagnosis and enhanced understanding of the dysmorphology, neurobehavioral phenotypes, and neuropathology associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. One goal of CIFASD is to integrate information from three modalities (brain, face, and behavior) at a variety of ages, to guide early recognition of FASD with greater sensitivity. Our research projects utilize state-of-the-art techniques in brain imaging, craniofacial image analysis, behavioral phenotyping, and genetics. Results: Our brain imaging project is examining data longitudinally, as preliminary data suggest a difference in the trajectory of brain developmental between alcohol-exposed and control children. Our behavioral projects are refining the profiles of cognitive deficits following prenatal alcohol exposure, and showing similarities and differences between behaviors of children with an FASD compared to those with ADHD. Our work on facial imaging may better identify not only individuals with FAS, but also those with subclinical features. We are examining potential biomarkers of alcohol exposure, and how genetic and nutritional variables modify FASD to better identify individuals with, or at risk for FASD. Conclusion: Our efforts are accelerating progress in identifying children with prenatal alcohol exposure, which we envision will lead to earlier and improved interventions. This work should inform promising practices in the identification and treatment of individuals exposed to alcohol prenatally.

N2  - Objectives: Alcohol consumption by pregnant women is related to fetal damage resulting in a large spectrum of physical and behavioral problems in the offspring. This study aimed to assess fetal exposure to alcohol in pregnant women through questionnaires, interviews and postpartum data in a Brazilian sample of pregnant women. Materials & Methods: Data were collected longitudinally from 66 pregnant women since the first trimester of pregnancy as well from their newborns. All participants are living in the region of Ribeirao Preto, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The questionnaires T-ACE (Tolerance, Annoyed, Cut down, Eye-Opener) and AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) were employed as screening instruments for alcohol use. Postpartum information was collected such as: birth weight and length, childbirth delivery type and newborn gender. Results: T-ACE positive pregnant women scored 2.69 +/- 0.79 and 9.2 +/- 4.1 in the questionnaires T-ACE and AUDIT (N = 36), respectively. The average number of drinks in the first, second and third trimester was 50.4, 12.6 and 15.7, respectively for the T-ACE positive group. Two thirds (66.67%) of the sample of pregnant women were found as AUDIT positive (cut-off > 7.0). A statistically significant inverse Spearman correlation was found only for newborns of female sex for birth length and AUDIT total score (N = 16, rho = - 0.556, p = 0.025). No newborn was found as a clinical FAS case, and all other birth parameters were found in the normal range. Conclusion: No statistical differences were observed in relation to anthropometric variables except for birth length in the female newborn. Meconium samples have been collected and will help to complement this study, allowing comparison of these values with the information provided by pregnant women and providing an objective measure in order to validate the findings.

N2  - Objectives: The adverse effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy have been widely reported, and represent a leading preventable cause of physical and cognitive birth defects in the United States (Bertrand, 2009; Hoyme et al., 2005; Wilton and Plane, 2006). Brief, effective interventions are needed to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy in sexually active women who drink and do not use effective contraception. Materials & Methods: The Healthy Choices study compared the efficacy of a brief intervention delivered either over the telephone or in-person. In addition to indicators of alcohol use, contraception methods and compliance were examined, along with measures of mood and domestic violence. Women between the ages of 18 and 44 who were drinking above recommended levels and not using effective contraception were randomly assigned to either a telephone intervention group (n=68) or in-person intervention group (n=63). Results: Overall, participants showed significant reductions in alcohol use, and increases in effective use of contraception (thus reducing their risk of an alcoholexposed pregnancy). There was no significant difference in success of the intervention between the two conditions (telephone vs. in-person). Conclusion: Telephone-based brief intervention can be successful and cost-effective in reducing the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy and the incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Objectives: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are preventable birth defects directly linked to consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, resulting in a significant public health cost burden. Current estimates suggest that 1% or 5 million people are living with fetal alcohol brain injury in Europe. Many medical and allied health professionals are key to (1) primary prevention of FASDs through working with women of childbearing age and (2) secondary prevention through working with affected individuals whose lives can be greatly improved with knowledge based interventions. The aim of this work was to demonstrate the pressing and urgent need for European health and allied health service providers to upskill their employees with the knowledge and ability to deal and manage FASD affected children & adults. Materials & Methods: Participants were drawn from Social Work, Psychology and Foster & Adoptive Parents who participated in FASD training in three different European sites (Ireland, United Kingdom, and Poland) during 2011. Training was delivered using core material from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder(s) Competency - using Curriculum Development Guide for Medical and Allied Health Education and Practice (CDC) alongside relevant local data of prevalence rates of FASD and drinking rates in pregnancy as applicable to the site of the training. Data was collated using structured evaluation questionnaires along with themed group work within the training events. Results: Evaluations from these multi-site training events suggest that Training, Education and Policy development concerning FASD is sought by allied health professionals, Foster & Adoptive Parents in order to properly respond to the needs of individuals living with FASD. The data suggests that there is an increased need for awareness of the life long disability of FASD and the complex problems faced by professionals to respond in a professionally competent manner. Conclusion: The evaluation of three European training events suggest that competence, especially when viewed separately in terms of knowledge versus capacity for application of information, in the area of FASDs is lacking in both the provider and caring professionals. Addressing this may be best achieved through the undertaking of a structured 'Training Needs Analysis' in multiple sites throughout the EU.

N2  - Background: FASD is the term used to describe different categories of consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. Abnormal growth and characteristic physical features can be present in FASD, and then the diagnostic term is the fetal alcohol syndrome with complete or partial features. Materials & Methods: All systems used to establish diagnostic criteria for FASD (Institute of Medicine, Canadian guidelines, 4 digit coding system), assess the presence or absence of the 3 major physical features (short palpebral features, smooth philtrum and upper lip) growth deficits (height and weight <10%) and physical evidence of central nervous system involvement (microcephaly) to identify the different diagnostic categories. In order to identify the physical features associated with FAS, several important facts should be taken into account: 1). Expert physical diagnosis can be necessary. FAS is a dysmorphic syndrome with similar features to several genetic or other teratogenic syndromes with intellectual disability and behavioral problems. A differential diagnosis with other conditions should always be made, especially when the full pattern of malformation characteristic of FAS is not present. Genetic tests may be needed to rule out other causes. 2). Several studies have proven that additional facial features such as abnormal ears (railroad track ears), ptosis of the eyelids, midface hypoplasia and a long philtrum, are all characteristic features or FAS. Other characteristic non-facial features include contractures of one or multiple joints (camptodactyly and others), limitation of pronation and supination of the elbow, clinodatyly of the 5th finger of the hands, and most importantly, abnormal hand creases (hockey stick crease and others) are also very specific to FASD and should be taken into account for this diagnosis. 3) It has been proven that all these physical features together in a pattern are very specific to FAS, and their presence should be a firm indicator that the etiology of learning or behavioral problems is in fact prenatal exposure to alcohol. In the absence of physical findings, firm recognition of exposure or the presence of a very characteristic neurobehavioral profile are necessary in order to make a diagnosis of FASD. 4) Many of these features are predictors of more severe neurobehavioral involvement, and lower IQs are seen in patients with the most prominent physical features. They can be predictors of outcome, according to the number (dysmorphology scores) and severity of the growth deficits and the dysmorphic features. Conclusions: We believe the identification of these physical features should be part of the knowledge of any pediatrician of other professional dealing with children at risk for FASD, but only expert physical diagnosis can assess some difficult cases and make sure no other condition is present, especially in the absence of known prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - Background: The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical, mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objectives: Assessment of exposure to ethanol at both prenatal and postnatal stages is essential for early prevention and intervention. Since pregnant women tend to underreport alcohol drinking by questionnaires, a number of biological markers have been proposed and evaluated for their capability to highlight gestational drinking behaviour. Materials & Methods: These biomarkers include classical biomarkers (albeit indirect) of alcoholinduced pathology (mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) acetaldehyde-derived conjugates, and finally derivatives of nonoxidative ethanol metabolism (fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG), ethyl sulphate (EtS) and phosphaditylethanol (PEth)). Since ethanol itself and acetaldehyde are only measured few hours after ethanol intake in conventional matrices such as blood, urine and sweat, they are only useful to detect recent ethanol exposure. In the past few years, the non-oxidative ethanol metabolites have received increasing attention because of their specificity and in some case wide time-window of detection in non-conventional matrices from the pregnant mother (oral fluid and hair) and fetusnewborn (neonatal hair, meconium, placenta and umbilical cord). Conclusions: This presentation reviews the markers of ethanol consumption during pregnancy and related prenatal exposure. In addition, clinical toxicological applications of these procedures are presented and discussed.

N2  - Objectives: This investigation's aim is to study features of maternal consumption of alcohol and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia, Russia). Materials & Methods: Quality and rate of Maternal Alcohol Consumption observation in 11 regions (uluses) by means of the interviews, physical assessment and study of case histories according to CDC recommendations (2004). Incidence and clinical features of FAS study in 13 uluses, orphanages and National Medical Center. 26 caucasian, 18 sakha and 12 native (evens, evenks) with FAS aged from 40 postmenstrual weeks to 7 years detailed observation by means of 4-digit Diagnostic Code, routine and agedependent developmental neurological assessment, brain ultrasonography, MRI, Denver test and Zhurba Scale. Results: Analysis of maternal alcohol consumption shows that from 0.7 to 6.1% of pregnant women in different uluses used alcohol, and from 0.2 to 4.5% drank heavily. There are no significant differences in maternal alcohol consumption in different ethnical groups. Incidence of FAS varies from 0.06 to 0.9% in child population of different uluses. We haven't found significant correlation between maternal alcohol consumption level and incidence of FAS in the uluses (r = 0.559; p = 0.093).Incidence of FAS varies from 0.3% in National Medical Center to 11.3-34.0% in orphanages. Our investigation demonstrates that native babies with FAS were born pre-term much oftener than sakha infants (chi2 = 4.54; p = 0.033). Sakha children with FAS have smaller birth weight and height than caucasian ones (chi2 = 4.35-5.90; p = 0.037-0.015). Clinical assessment and neurovisualization show that caucasian patients have ptosis and ventriculodilatation significantly more frequently than sakha babies (chi2 = 5.11-5.97; p = 0.024-0.015); sakha infants have much more frequently muscle tone deviations, inborn heart defects, visual nerve atrophy and subarachnoid space dilatation than other ones (chi2 = 11.55-4.10; p = 0.0007-0.043). Native children demonstrate better quality of social adaptation than caucasian babies (chi2 = 10.26-4.10; p = 0.0014). Conclusion: Our investigation shows the necessity of taking into account ethnical and regional features of maternal alcohol consumption and FAS manifestation in epidemiological and clinical study.

N2  - Objectives: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a very common and completely avoidable disease. FAS has severe consequences not only for the individual and its direct environment but also for the health and social system in Germany. Aims: The first aim of the development of the German guideline was the determination of evidence-based and in practice easily applicable diagnostic criteria for the identification of FAS in children and adolescents in Germany. With help of the defined diagnostic criteria FAS should be diagnosed and treated earlier, so secondary complications can be reduced. The second aim was to create awareness in the German society of the severe complications of intrauterine alcohol exposition in order to decrease the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and diminish the incidence of FAS. Materials & Methods: A steering group in Munich and a consensus group consisting of representatives of the German Federal Ministry of Health, the German Professional Societies of Pediatrics, Neuropediatrics, Social Pediatrics, Gynecology, Neonatology, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Addiction Research and Therapy, Addiction Medicine, Addiction Psychology, Midwife Sciences, Midwives, Doctors of the Public Health Service, of the Patient Support Group FASworld Germany and additional FAS experts have been established in 2011. The AWMF (Association of the scientific medical societies) was responsible for the methodological guidance. Systematic literature retrieval and determination of levels of evidence were conducted by the AZQ (Medical Center for Quality in Medicine). Results: The methodological quality of the international and especially the German publications about the diagnostic criteria are rather poor. Most of the existing international guidelines for the diagnosis of FAS are consensus- but not strictly evidence-based. Evidence-and consensus-based criteria for the diagnosis of FAS were evaluated and established for Germany. The methodological process is described. The implication of the guideline is performed by algorithms for pediatricians and general practitioners for the referral of children with suspected FAS. Another algorithm including the defined diagnostic criteria of FAS has been developed for experts Conclusion: There is great need for a standardized, multidisciplinary, quality assured and implementable prevention of FAS in Germany. The first step was the development of an evidence- and consensus-based diagnostic guideline for children with FAS in Germany.

N2  - Objectives: Diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is complex, with numerous competing diagnostic systems. All recent diagnostic systems require the presence of growth restriction, mental retardation and 3 characteristic facial features. Software developed at the University of Washington has been created to objectively analyse digital photographs, measuring for the unique triad of FAS facial features: small palprebral fissure length (PFL), thin upper lip and smooth philtrum. This software has been validated in older children, but has not been used in neonates. We are unable to find neonatal normal reference ranges for measures except PFL. Early diagnosis in children has been associated with better outcomes. This study aims to determine the feasibility of using the facial analysis software to identify features associated with fetal alcohol exposure in normal neonates and if successful to develop normal reference ranges for Caucasian neonates. Materials & Methods: Ethics approval and informed consent was obtained. Healthy Caucasian neonates were photographed according to a standardised protocol. Mothers were asked to fill out an anonymous lifestyle questionnaire including questions on alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Standard physical measurements of the baby were taken. PFL and upper lip circularity (LC) were measured using the software. Philtrum smoothness and LC was assessed on a 5 point likert scale using reference photos. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Results: 33 neonates were recruited. PFL was measurable in 24 photographs (72.7%). Mean PFL was 15.5mm (95% C.I 13.1 - 17.9mm).LC was measurable in 33 photographs (100%). Mean LC was 59.4 (95% C.I. 18.1 - 100.5). Median LC and philtrum smoothness Likert ranks were both 3. 4 neonates were assessed as having FAS type features according to Likert ranking including 2 with abstinent mothers. 7 mothers (21.2%) reported drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Conclusion: It was possible to measure a full data set on just over 3/4 of neonates, demonstrating the feasibility of this method at this age. Mean PFL from this pilot study was significantly below previous published reference ranges. Current Likert scale reference photos may not be appropriate for neonates. Further data collection is required for development of robust reference ranges using this method.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of comprehensive community-based interventions to reduce fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in two populations from the Northern Cape Province in South Africa. Materials & Methods: Changes in the prevalence of FASD, and in maternal knowledge and drinking behaviour, were assessed in De Aar and Upington, Northern Cape Province, before and after an intensive community-level intervention. Eight community workers implemented educational activities to raise awareness of the risks of maternal drinking and to alter community norms about alcohol use in pregnancy. All children were examined by two dysmorphologists at 9 months of age and those with evidence of FASD were reassessed at 18 months. Neuropsychometrists evaluated infant neurodevelopment. Structured maternal interviews with FASD cases and matched controls determined patterns of alcohol use and knowledge about FASD. Results: At baseline, 809 children were evaluated, 751 after intervention. FASD prevalence pre-intervention was 8.9% (72/809) and 5.7% post intervention (43/751; P=0.02). In multivariate logistic regression, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity, FASD prevalence was 0.73 fold lower post-intervention than pre-intervention (95%CI=0.58-0.90; P=0.004). Dysmorphology scores reduced from 4 at baseline (IQR=2-7) to 3 (IQR=1-6; P=0.002). After intervention, a large proportion of women reported having received educational messages, levels of knowledge about alcohol increased and some changes were detected in attitudes to drinking. Conclusion: Comprehensive community-level interventions might reduce the burden of FASD in heavily-affected areas of South Africa, by about 30%. This, the first study ever to document the effectiveness of FASD prevention using clinical outcomes, suggests that comprehensive community-level services should be implemented in similar settings to reduce this very common, oft neglected, disorder.

N2  - Background: Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, has recently been detected in cord blood of infants born to alcohol-abusing mothers. Formic acid detoxification requires folic acid. However, in a rodent model, placental folate-receptors have decreased expression after alcohol exposure. We hypothesize that folate transport to the fetus will be decreased after chronic alcohol exposure and that these decreased levels will limit the ability to detoxify formic acid. These factors may, in part, contribute to deficits in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Objectives: To determine if alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in lower folate transport to the fetus and whether lower folate levels decrease the ability to detoxify formic acid. Methods: Serum folate was measured in maternal and cord blood at delivery from alcohol-abusing mothers and controls. As an in vitro model, a choriocarcinoma cell line (BeWo) was characterized after culturing in folate-free conditions. Results: The fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was <1.0 in half of the alcohol-exposed pairs (n=12), whereas all of the controls were >1.0 (n=8). Mean folate in cord samples was lower in alcohol-exposed cord than in the controls (25.83 +/- 13.58 vs. 44.04 +/- 10.86, p<0.01). BeWo cells were found to proliferate and maintain normal morphology when introduced into folate-free DMEM. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that folic acid transport to the human fetus is compromised in pregnancies affected by alcohol-abuse. BeWo cells can proliferate under folate-free conditions and will be utilized to investigate formate kinetics and toxicity.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders result from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and are characterized, in some cases, by central nervous system anomalies and cognitive impairment. Regional patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities suggest that alcohol exerts selective damage on the developing fetal brain. This study assessed brain-behavior relationships in a sample of youth with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. The aim was to characterize how structural brain alterations observed in our previous studies relate to cognitive deficits commonly reported in individuals with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Twenty-one youth (mean age 13 years) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 7 nonexposed healthy comparison subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and neurobehavioral testing. Regional brain volumes within the alcohol-exposed group were correlated with neuropsychological measures of cognitive control and verbal learning/recall, as these aspects of cognition have previously been shown to be vulnerable to alcohol teratogenesis. Results: Between-group effect sizes revealed moderate to large cognitive performance and brain volume decrements in alcohol-exposed subjects, compared with typically developing peers. Within the alcohol-exposed group, volume of the caudate nuclei was the most consistent predictor of neuropsychological performance, after controlling for potentially confounding variables including total brain volume, IQ, and age. Conclusions: These data are consistent with previous research associating gestational alcohol exposure with structural and functional changes of the caudate nucleus. Our findings extend this previous work by demonstrating that volume reductions of the caudate have behavioral relevance for this population, in relation to cognitive control and verbal learning and recall abilities. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy causes birth defects and lifelong disabilities in the affected children. Due to the wide range of symptoms related to prenatal alcohol exposition, the umbrella term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is used. FASD covers full Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (pFAS). Children with FAS are smaller in length and weight than healthy children of their age. Head circumference s smaller as well. Typical signs of FAS are facial characteristics such small eyes, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip. Many affected children only show distinct behavioural problems (pFAS). Children with FAS or pFAS do not recognize dangerous situations, they would go with anyone, and are easily influenced. They are forgetful, do not learn from consequences. The diagnosis of FAS goes by small size and weight of the children, and the typical facial alterations. pFAS, however, is diagnosed if behavioural, social and emotional problems are present, and prenatal alcohol exposition is assured by anamnesis. Medical treatment is supplemented by occupational and behavioural therapy. The affected children need instruction, orientation, apportionment concerning time (and space), and a firm daily routine. At legal age, most patients with FASD are not able to live autonomously. They are naive and easily talked into things, therefore they require long-lasting care.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading non-genetic cause of neurodevelopmental disability in children. Although alcohol is clearly teratogenic, environmental factors such as gravidity and socioeconomic status significantly modify individual FASD risk despite equivalent alcohol intake. An explanation for this variability could inform FASD prevention. Here we show that the most common nutritional deficiency of pregnancy, iron deficiency without anemia (ID), is a potent and synergistic modifier of FASD risk. Using an established rat model of third trimester-equivalent binge drinking, we show that ID significantly interacts with alcohol to impair postnatal somatic growth, associative learning, and white matter formation, as compared with either insult separately. For the associative learning and myelination deficits, the ID-alcohol interaction was synergistic and the deficits persisted even after the offsprings' iron status had normalized. Importantly, the observed deficits in the ID-alcohol animals comprise key diagnostic criteria of FASD. Other neurobehaviors were normal, showing the ID-alcohol interaction was selective and did not reflect a generalized malnutrition. Importantly ID worsened FASD outcome even though the mothers lacked overt anemia; thus diagnostics that emphasize hematological markers will not identify pregnancies at-risk. This is the first direct demonstration that, as suggested by clinical studies, maternal iron status has a unique influence upon FASD outcome. While alcohol is unquestionably teratogenic, this ID-alcohol interaction likely represents a significant portion of FASD diagnoses because ID is more common in alcohol-abusing pregnancies than generally appreciated. Iron status may also underlie the associations between FASD and parity or socioeconomic status. We propose that increased attention to normalizing maternal iron status will substantially improve FASD outcome, even if maternal alcohol abuse continues. These findings offer novel insights into how alcohol damages the developing brain. © 2012 Rufer et al.

N2  - Ethanol is a legal and widely available substance. There are health and social consequences associated with its abuse. One of the most important problems is related to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In fact, prenatal ethanol exposure can be associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), a term used to describe a wide range of potentially lifelong effects that include physical, mental, behavioral, and learning disabilities. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), which are non-oxidative metabolites of ethanol, are currently used as biomarkers of direct ethanol consumption in different matrices, including hair, blood, skin surface, and meconium. Analysis of these compounds in meconium reveals exposure to alcohol during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. An important finding for evaluation of gestational ethanol exposure is the fact that FAEEs do not cross the placenta. Because they accumulate in the fetal gut from approximately the 20th week of gestation until birth, this provides a wide window of detection of chronic exposure to alcohol. The sum of the concentrations of all the FAEEs, with a cutoff of 2 nmol g -1 or 600 ng g-1 meconium, has been recommended as evidence of maternal alcohol use. We introduce a novel technique to quantify ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl stearate, and their deuterated analogues (as internal standards, IS) in meconium using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Limits of detection and quantification were 50 and 100 ng g-1 for all analytes except ethyl stearate (LOD 100 ng g-1 and LOQ 500 ng g-1). Calibration curves were linear from the LOQ to 5000 ng g-1. The validated method was applied to the analysis of 81 meconium samples. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy may result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which is an umbrella term used to describe a range of conditions that are associated with significant neurodevelopmental impairments. Communicating an FASD diagnosis to a child is a complex and difficult task that requires a great deal of care, particularly due to the sensitive nature of the etiology of these disorders. To the best of our knowledge, there are no formal guidelines or published materials that outline the ethical considerations specifically associated with disclosing an FASD diagnosis to a child. This paper discusses a number of ethical principles and situational factors that should be considered when communicating an FASD diagnosis, as well as some of the potential risks and benefits associated with disclosure. We also provide recommendations to assist clinicians in communicating the diagnosis in a manner that increases understanding and minimizes harm to the child. Future recommendations include the development of formalized guidelines in order to aid clinicians in carrying out this sensitive task. © 2012 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Background: Most children who are exposed to large quantities of alcohol in utero do not develop fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Population-based prospective data on the risk of developing components of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), however, are limited. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of 9,628 women screened during their first prenatal appointment in Chile, which identified 101 who consumed at least 4 drinks/d (exposed) matched with 101 women with no reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy (unexposed). Detailed alcohol consumption data were collected during the pregnancy. Children were evaluated up to 8.5 years of age by clinicians masked to exposure status. Results: One or more functional central nervous system abnormalities were present in 44.0% (22/50) of the exposed children compared to 13.6% (6/44) of the unexposed (p = 0.002). Growth restriction was present in 27.2% (25/92) of the exposed and 12.5% (12/96) of the unexposed (p = 0.02). Abnormal facial features were present in 17.3% (14/81) of the exposed children compared to 1.1% (1/89) of the unexposed children (p = 0.0002) by direct examination. Of the 59 exposed children with data available to detect at least 1 abnormality, 12 (20.3%) had no abnormalities. Binge drinking from conception to recognition of pregnancy (OR = 1.48 per day, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.91, p = 0.002) and after recognition of pregnancy (OR= 1.41 per day, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.95, p = 0.04) and total number of drinks consumed per week from conception to recognition of pregnancy (OR = 1.02 per drink, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.04, p = 0.0009) were significantly associated with abnormal child outcome. Conclusions: After exposure to heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy, 80% of children had 1 or more abnormalities associated with alcohol exposure. Patterns of alcohol use that posed the greatest risk of adverse outcomes were binge drinking and high total weekly intake. Functional neurologic impairment occurred most frequently and may be the only sign to alert physicians to prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Both sensory and cognitive deficits have been associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol; however, very few studies have focused on sensory deficits in preschool-aged children. As sensory skills develop early, characterization of sensory deficits using novel imaging methods may reveal important neural markers of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Participants in this study were 10 children with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and 15 healthy control (HC) children aged 3 to 6 years. All participants had normal hearing as determined by clinical screens. We measured their neurophysiological responses to auditory stimuli (1,000 Hz, 72 dB tone) using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We used a multidipole spatio-temporal modeling technique to identify the location and timecourse of cortical activity in response to the auditory tones. The timing and amplitude of the left and right superior temporal gyrus sources associated with activation of left and right primary/secondary auditory cortices were compared across groups. Results: There was a significant delay in M100 and M200 latencies for the FASD children relative to the HC children (p = 0.01), when including age as a covariate. The within-subjects effect of hemisphere was not significant. A comparable delay in M100 and M200 latencies was observed in children across the FASD subtypes. Conclusions: Auditory delay revealed by MEG in children with FASDs may prove to be a useful neural marker of information processing difficulties in young children with prenatal alcohol exposure. The fact that delayed auditory responses were observed across the FASD spectrum suggests that it may be a sensitive measure of alcohol-induced brain damage. Therefore, this measure in conjunction with other clinical tools may prove useful for early identification of alcohol affected children, particularly those without dysmorphia. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Pathological changes in skeletal remains are difficult to diagnose, but may provide some clues as to the personal history and identification of an individual. In 2011, a skeletonized forensic case of a juvenile individual was received from the Northern Cape. The remains were suspected to have belonged to a girl who went missing in 2003. The aim of this study is to report on the findings from this case. Anthropological assessment indicated that the remains possibly belonged to a female individual of 12-15 years. Several pathological changes and skeletal abnormalities were observed which included an abnormally shaped head with bulging forehead, slight microcephaly, facial asymmetry, enamel hypoplasia, cribra orbitalia, spina bifida occulta of L1, and growth retardation. A tentative diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made, and it was later confirmed by SAPS that the suspected parents of this individual have a history of alcohol abuse. FAS occurs in children born to women who consume large quantities of alcohol during pregnancy. This condition presents various degrees of severity, and this case probably represents an extreme version of FAS. Differential diagnosis would include malnutrition, chronic infectious disease, or mental retardation of other causes. Although not conclusive, the combination of abnormalities seen in this individual is strongly suggestive of FAS, and to our knowledge this is the first skeletal case with this condition to be reported.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Not all women who consume alcohol during pregnancy have children with FASD and studies have shown that genetic factors can play a role in ethanol teratogenesis. We examined gene expression in embryos and placentae from C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice following prenatal alcohol exposure. B6 fetuses are susceptible to morphological malformations following prenatal alcohol exposure while D2 are relatively resistant. Methods: Male and female B6 and D2 mice were mated for 2 hours in the morning, producing 4 embryonic genotypes: true-bred B6B6 and D2D2, and reciprocal B6D2 and D2B6. On gestational day 9, dams were intubated with 5.8 g/kg ethanol, an isocaloric amount of maltose dextrin, or nothing. Four hours later, dams were sacrificed and embryos and placentae were harvested. RNA was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 v2 microarray chips. Data were normalized, subjected to analysis of variance and tested for enrichment of gene ontology molecular function and biological process using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Results: Several gene classes were differentially expressed in B6 and D2 regardless of treatment, including genes involved in polysaccharide binding and mitosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure altered expression of a subset of genes, including genes involved in methylation, chromatin remodeling, protein synthesis, and mRNA splicing. Very few genes were differentially expressed between maltose-exposed tissues and tissues that received nothing, so we combined these groups for comparisons with ethanol. While we observed many expression changes specific to B6 following prenatal alcohol exposure, none were specific for D2. Gene classes up- or down-regulated in B6 following prenatal alcohol exposure included genes involved in mRNA splicing, transcription, and translation. Conclusions: Our study identified several classes of genes with altered expression following prenatal alcohol exposure, including many specific for B6, a strain susceptible to ethanol teratogenesis. Lack of strain specific effects in D2 suggests there are few gene expression changes that confer resistance. Future studies will begin to analyze functional significance of the expression changes. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: The identification of individuals exposed prenatally to alcohol can be challenging, with only those having the characteristic pattern of facial features, central nervous system abnormality, and growth retardation receiving a clinical diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Methods: Seventeen anthropometric measurements were obtained at 5 and 9 years from 125 Cape Town, South African children, studied since birth. The children were divided into 3 groups: FAS or partial FAS (PFAS), heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE), and non-alcohol-exposed controls (C). Anthropometric measurements were evaluated for mean group differences. Logistic regression models were used to identify the subset of anthropometric measures that best predicted group membership. Anthropometric measurements were examined at the 2 ages in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure obtained prospectively from the mothers during pregnancy. Correlation of these facial measurements with key neurobehavioral outcomes including Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-IV IQ and eyeblink conditioning was used to assess their utility as indicators of alcohol-related central nervous system impairment. Results: Significant group differences were found for the majority of the anthropometric measures, with means of these measures smaller in the FAS/PFAS compared with HE or C. Upper facial widths, ear length, lower facial depth, and eye widths were consistent predictors distinguishing those exposed to alcohol from those who were not. Using longitudinal data, unique measures were identified that predicted facial anomalies at one age but not the other, suggesting the face changes as the individual matures. And 41% of the FAS/PFAS group met criteria for microtia at both ages. Three of the predictive anthropometric measures were negatively related to measures of prenatal alcohol consumption, and all were positively related to at least 1 neurobehavioral outcome. Conclusions: The analysis of longitudinal data identified a common set of predictors, as well as some that are unique at each age. Prenatal alcohol exposure appears to have its primary effect on brain growth, reflected by smaller forehead widths, and may suppress neural crest migration to the branchial arches, reflected by deficits in ear length and mandibular dimensions. These results may improve diagnostic resolution and enhance our understanding of the relation between the face and the neuropsychological deficits that occur. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a common cause of intellectual impairment and birth defects. More recently, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been found to be a risk factor for fetal mortality, stillbirth and infant and child mortality. This has led to increased concern about detection and management of PAE. One to 2 h after maternal ingestion, fetal blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) reach levels nearly equivalent to maternal levels. Ethanol elimination by the fetus is impaired because of reduced metabolic capacity. Fetal exposure time is prolonged owing to the reuptake of amniotic-fluid containing ethanol by the fetus. Alcohol elimination from the fetus relies on the mother's metabolic capacity. Metabolic capacity among pregnant women varies eightfold (from 0.0025 to 0.02 g dl-1 h-1), which may help explain how similar amounts of ethanol consumption during pregnancy results in widely varying phenotypic presentations of FASD. At birth physiological changes alter the neonate's metabolic capacity and it rapidly rises to a mean value of 83.5% of the mother's capacity. FASDs are highly recurrent and younger siblings have increased risk. Detection of prenatal alcohol use offers an important opportunity for office-based interventions to decrease exposure for the remainder of pregnancy and identification of women who need substance abuse treatment. Mothers of children with FAS have been found to drink faster, get drunk quicker and to have higher BACs. A modest increase in the prevalence of a polymorphism of alcohol dehydrogenase, which increases susceptibility to adverse outcomes from PAE has been reported. Lastly, detection of alcohol use and appropriate management would decrease risk from PAE for subsequent pregnancies. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading cause of intellectual disability in the Western world. Due to the organic brain damage caused by alcohol, and the resulting cognitive, functional, and behavioural deficits, people with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) are at high risk for becoming involved in the legal system, either as offenders or as victims, if appropriate diagnosis, interventions and support services are not initiated early in life and maintained throughout the life-course. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of incarceration for youths (12-18 years) with FASD, compared to youths without FASD, in Canada. Using the epidemiological data available on the prevalence of incarceration in youths with FASD and data on the prevalence of incarceration in youths without FASD in the general population of Canada, it was estimated that youths with FASD are nineteen times more likely to be imprisoned than youths without FASD, on any given day in a specific year. These alarming study findings emphasize the need to incorporate screening for FASD as early as possible in the criminal justice process. It is crucial to better understand the mental disabilities of offenders prenatally exposed to alcohol and make appropriate referrals for mental health and other services.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the leading preventable cause of developmental disabilities in the United States and likely throughout the world. FASDs can be prevented by avoiding alcohol use during pregnancy; however, efforts to prevent risky alcohol consumption in women of childbearing potential have not been universally successful. Objectives: Data suggest that successful interventions may require tailoring methods to meet the needs of specific populations and cultures. Key findings of interventions previously tested among American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) women who are or may become pregnant, data gaps, and promising ongoing interventions are reviewed. Methods: A systematic review of the current literature on empirically based interventions among AI/AN women was conducted. Selected alternative approaches currently being tested in AI/AN settings are also described. Results: Similar to findings among other populations of women in the United States, a number of interventions have been implemented; however, only a small number have measured results. Approaches have included standard interventions involving hospitalization, inpatient, or outpatient care; wellness education; traditional approaches; and case management for high-risk women. An ongoing Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocol comparing the effectiveness of a web-based culturally adapted tool, or a peer health educator model to standard clinical practice is described. Conclusion: Translation of successful interventions from other settings to AI/AN populations holds promise. Scientific Significance: FASDs represent a significant health issue with high personal and societal costs. Improvement of interventions to prevent prenatal alcohol consumption in specific populations, including AI/AN women, is a critical public health need. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - While it is known that suboptimal maternal vitamin D status can be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, the frequency of low vitamin D status in many populations is a subject of debate. Our ongoing study investigates the nutrient status of alcohol-exposed Ukrainian pregnant women and whether micronutrient supplementation can reduce the risk of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Blood samples and alcohol consumption data are collected at the time of enrollment (mean gestational age, 20.4 +/-7.0 wk). Here we present data on the baseline vitamin D status of these women. Mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [25(OH)D] of alcohol-exposed (n=180) and unexposed (n=180) women were 20.6 ng/mL and 21.8 ng/mL, respectively. Across both groups, 50.6% and 32.9% were classified as vitamin D deficient [25(OH)D <20ng/mL] or insufficient [25(OH)D >20 ng/mL and <30 ng/mL], respectively. When adjusted for solar radiation by month, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestation age at blood draw, smoking status, and age, regression analyses showed that each additional oz. of alcohol consumed per drinking day, in the 2 weeks prior to the time of enrollment, was associated with a 2.4 ng/mL decrease in 25(OH)D concentrations (P=0.03). These data suggest a very high prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D status in pregnant Ukrainian women and an adverse effect of alcohol consumption on vitamin D status.

N2  - The deleterious effects exerted by prenatal ethanol exposure include physical, mental, behavioural and/or learning disabilities that are included in the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objective assessment of exposure to ethanol at both prenatal and postnatal stages is essential for early prevention and intervention. Since pregnant women tend to underreport alcohol drinking by questionnaires, a number of biological markers have been proposed and evaluated for their capability to highlight gestational drinking behaviour. These biomarkers include classical biomarkers (albeit indirect) of alcohol-induced pathology (mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) acetaldehyde-derived conjugates, and finally derivatives of non-oxidative ethanol metabolism (fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG), ethyl sulphate (EtS) and phosphaditylethanol (PEth)). Since ethanol itself and acetaldehyde are only measured few hours after ethanol intake in conventional matrices such as blood, urine and sweat, they are only useful to detect recent ethanol exposure. In the past few years, the non-oxidative ethanol metabolites have received increasing attention because of their specificity and in some case wide time-window of detection in non-conventional matrices from the pregnant mother (oral fluid and hair) and fetus-newborn (neonatal hair, meconium, placenta and umbilical cord). This article reviews bioanalytical procedures for the determination of these markers of ethanol consumption during pregnancy and related prenatal exposure. In addition, clinical toxicological applications of these procedures are presented and discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

From this group, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the only disorder coded in the International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10). This coding was used to gain an understanding on the health care utilization and the mortality rate for individuals diagnosed with FAS, as well as to estimate the associated health care costs in Canada for the most recent available fiscal year (2008-2009). Methods: Health care utilization data associated with a diagnosis of FAS were directly obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). Mortality data associated with a diagnosis of FAS were obtained from Statistics Canada. Results: The total direct health care cost of acute care, psychiatric care, day surgery, and emergency department services associated with FAS in Canada in 2008-2009, based on the official CIHI data, was about $6.7 million. The vast majority of the most responsible diagnoses, which account for the majority of a patient's length of stay in hospital, fall within the ICD-10 category Mental and Behavioural Disorders (F00-F99). It was evident that the burden and cost of acute care hospitalizations due to FAS is increasing -1.6 times greater in 2008-2009, compared to 2002-2003. The mortality data due to FAS, obtained from Statistics Canada (2000-2008), may be underreported, and are likely invalid. Discussion: The official data on the utilization of health care services by individuals diagnosed with FAS are likely to be underreported and therefore, the reported cost figures are most likely underestimated. The quantification of the health care costs associated with FAS is crucial for policy developers and decision makers alike, of the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure, with the ultimate goal of initiating preventive interventions to address FASD. © 2012 Popova et al.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: In the rat, binge-like ethanol (EtOH) exposure during the early neonatal period (a developmental period equivalent to the human third trimester) can result in a permanent deficit of cerebellar Purkinje cells (Pcells). However, the consequences of a moderate binge alcohol exposure on a single day during this postnatal period have not been established. This is an issue of importance as many pregnant women binge drink periodically at social drinking levels. This study aimed to identify both the acute and long-term effects of exposure to a single alcohol binge that achieved a mean peak blood EtOH concentration of approximately 250 mg/dl during early postnatal life using a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Methods: Acute apoptotic Pcell death 10 hours after a moderate dose binge EtOH exposure from postnatal days (PDs) 0 to 10 was assessed using active caspase-3 immunolabeling. Acute Pcell apoptosis was quantified in cerebellar vermal lobules I-X using the physical disector method. Long-term effects were assessed at PD 60 using stereological methods to determine total Pcell numbers in the vermis, lobule III, and lobule IX, following a moderate dose binge EtOH exposure at PDs 0, 2, or 4. Results: Acute apoptosis was induced by EtOH on PDs 1 to 8 in a time and lobular-dependent manner. For EtOH exposure on PD 2, significant long-term Pcell loss occurred in lobule III. EtOH exposure on PD 4 resulted in significant long-term Pcell loss throughout the entire vermis. Conclusions: These results indicate that a single, early EtOH episode of moderate dose can create significant and permanent Pcell loss in the developing cerebellum. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability. The mechanisms underlying FASD are incompletely understood, and biomarkers to identify those at risk are lacking. Here, we perform metabolomic analysis of embryoid bodies and neural lineages derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells to identify the neural secretome produced in response to ethanol (EtOH) exposure. Methods: WA01 and WA09 hES cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies, neural progenitors, or neurons. Cells along this progression were cultured for 4 days with 0, 0.1, or 0.3% EtOH. Supernatants were subjected to C18 chromatography followed by ESI-QTOF-MS. Features were annotated using public databases, and the identities of 4 putative biomarkers were confirmed with purified standards and comparative MS/MS. Results: EtOH treatment induced statistically significant changes to metabolite abundance in human embryoid bodies (180 features), neural progenitors (76 features), and neurons (42 features). There were no shared significant features between different cell types. Fifteen features showed a dose-response to EtOH. Four chemical identities were confirmed: l-thyroxine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, and the tryptophan metabolites, l-kynurenine and indoleacetaldehyde. One feature with a putative annotation of succinyladenosine was significantly increased in both EtOH treatments. Additional features were selective to EtOH treatment but were not annotated in public databases. Conclusions: EtOH exposure induces statistically significant changes to the metabolome profile of human embryoid bodies, neural progenitors, and neurons. Several of these metabolites are normally present in human serum, suggesting their usefulness as potential serum FASD biomarkers. These findings suggest the biochemical pathways that are affected by EtOH in the developing nervous system and delineate mechanisms of alcohol injury during human development. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and particularly, the most severe manifestation, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), are more common in disadvantaged populations. Developmental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) may be potentiated by environmental factors like suboptimal nutrition, found in emerging countries. To evaluate potential benefits of micronutrients, including choline, in the teratogenesis of PAE in an at risk population, we carried out a clinical trial at two Omni-Net sites in Western Ukraine, Khmelnitsky and Rivne. Methods. Alcohol-using and nondrinking women were recruited midpregnancy and randomized to one of three groups: multivitamin/multimineral supplement (MVM); MVM+choline; nonsupplemented group. Children (N=192) were followed-up at six months gestational age with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd ED) yielding standard scores for Mental Development Index (MDI), Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) and measures of orientation, emotional reactivity, motor performance and total behavioral functioning. Results. Generalized Linear Modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between amount of alcohol used (ounces of absolute alcohol per day preconception and during the two weeks prior to enrollment) with developmental outcomes. We collapsed the two supplement groups (Suppl group) and controlled effects of social class (SES), smoking, gender, vitamin and folic acid use prior to recruitment. At six months, MDI was significantly impacted by alcohol dose during the first trimester (beta=-14.66, X2(1)=9.3, p<.002) with those exposed to more alcohol having lower cognitive scores. Moreover, there was also an effect of Suppl with those who did not receive supplements performing more poorly (beta=-3.69, X2(1)=8.03, p<.005). The PDI scores did not differ by intervention group but showed a significant effect of 1st trimester alcohol dose (beta=-26.99, X2(1)=8.28, p<.004) on motor function. Orientation behavior also differed as a function of Suppl Group ((beta=-5.45, X2(1)=4.51, p<.03) and as a result of alcohol dose at conception (beta=-4.52, X2(1)=5.75, p<.02); Motor Optimality was affected by alcohol dose at conception and during the 1st trimester and there were no effects of factors measured on Emotional reactivity at this age. These results suggest that multimicronutrient supplementation can reduce the negative impact of alcohol use during pregnancy on specific developmental outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Novel interventions to prevent or ameliorate the effects of human teratogens have rarely been identified. Although the optimum prevention for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is to avoid pregnancy exposure entirely, efforts to change maternal behaviors with respect to alcohol have been less than universally successful. The possibility of a low-cost, acceptable, and effective intervention that would attenuate some of the prenatal effects of alcohol has important implications worldwide. Methods: In the context of the NIH-NIAAA Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, a multimicronutrient supplement intervention study has been ongoing in two regions of Ukraine. A total of 300 moderately to heavily alcohol-exposed pregnant women and 300 low or unexposed comparison women were recruited on average in the second trimester. Maternal nutritional status was assessed in blood at the time of enrollment, and women were randomly assigned within alcohol exposure group to one of three groups: multimicronutrient supplement, multimicronutrient supplement with an additional supplement containing 700mg. of choline, or standard of care. Outcomes measured included a standard dysmorphology examination for physical features of FASD in the newborn period and again at six and 12 months of age, and neurobehavioral assessments using two different paradigms at six and 12 months of age. Results: Baseline maternal nutritional status on selected micronutrients is associated with risk for selected alcohol-related facial features among those in the alcohol-exposed group, suggesting that maternal nutritional status early in development may be a protective or permissive factor for initiation of some structural effects in infants born to drinking mothers. Furthermore, among 6-month olds tested with the Bay ley, the effect of dose of alcohol was attenuated by multimicronutrient supplementation. Conclusion: The role of maternal nutritional status in moderating the effects of prenatal alcohol consumption is evolving as a potentially important factor. Moreover, the concept that a simple, low-cost intervention with vitamin-mineral supplements, initiated after recognition of pregnancy, can potentially rescue infants from some degree of deficit has important implications for prevention and intervention in multiple economic and cultural settings.

N2  - Alcohol consumption of mothers during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome associated with massive neuronal apoptosis. Acute exposure of developing rodents to alcohol causes likewise extensive apoptotic neurodegeneration throughout the brain. In our research we used 7 day-old mice as a model of fetal alcohol syndrom in humans. Using activated caspase-3 and TUNEL staining as markers of the apoptotic process we demonstrated that taurine at a dose of 2 g/kg saves in 7 day-old mice about 50% of dying neurons in the external and internal layers of the cerebellum from ethanol-induced apoptosis. In an attempt to rescue more neurons we increased the taurine dose two- and threefold. Ethanol (20% w/v solution) was administered subcutaneously at a total dose of 5 g/kg (2.5 g/kg at 1 h and 2.5 g/kg at 3 h). Taurine (7% solution) was injected in two half-doses (first at 0 h and second at 4 h). Opposite to our expectations the increased taurine doses administered to ethanol-injected mice induced death. The dose of 4 g/kg co-administered with ethanol killed 50% of mice and the dose of 6 g/kg killed them all. All mice treated with ethanol or taurine alone survived. We repeated the same regime in adult (5-6 months) and old (12-13 months) mice with different doses of ethanol and taurine injected intraperitoneally. The co-administration of taurine at a total dose of 10 g/kg with ethanol (8 g/kg) killed 100% of adult mice. In the old mice the lethal dose was 6 g/kg of taurine coadministered with 6 g/kg of ethanol. All adult and old mice treated with taurine or ethanol alone survived. The adult and old mice treated with ethanol and taurine showed a marked fall in the blood glucose level before their deaths. No changes occurred in the blood glucose level in mice which received only taurine or ethanol. We assume that the drop in blood glucose after the taurine and ethanol co-administration can be one reason of lethality. Comparison of the lethal doses of taurine and ethanol co-administration in 7 day-old, adult and old mice allows us to conclude that the adverse effects of taurine and ethanol combined toxicity is age-dependent. Our present findings are an important warning sign of the interactions of taurine and ethanol and their combined toxic effects, particularly for young people mixing taurine-containing energy drinks with alcohol.

N2  - Objectives: Folic acid (FOL) is concentrated in the fetal circulation by the placenta so that cord levels are higher than maternal levels. FOL is also required for detoxification of formic acid (FA), the toxic metabolite of methanol that has recently been observed in cord blood of infants born to alcohol-using mothers. The objectives of this study were to determine if FOL transport to the fetus is decreased after heavy alcohol exposure and therefore the ability to detoxify FA is compromised. These factors may contribute to deficits observed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Folate was measured in maternal and cord blood from alcohol-abusing mothers and controls. Results: The fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was <1.0 in half of the alcohol-exposed pairs (n=12), whereas all of the controls were >1.0 (n=8). Mean folate in cord samples was lower in alcoholexposed than in the controls (25.83+/-13.58 vs 44.04+/-10.86, p<0.01). There was a significant correlation between the control maternal and cord folate levels (p<0.05) whereas the alcohol group correlation was not significant. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that FOL transport to the fetus is compromised in pregnancies affected by alcohol-abuse. This supports our hypothesis that FA may indeed be a significant contributor in the etiology of FASD, and, that FOL as part of treatment to mitigate its effects needs to be investigated.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which encompass a range of physical, behavioral, learning, emotional and social disturbances. In spite of widespread educational efforts about the dangers of drinking during pregnancy, the incidence of FASD has not diminished and alcohol is now identified as the leading human teratogen. The failure of education to reduce the incidence of FASD makes it important to obtain understanding of the mechanism by which alcohol exposure causes neurodevelopmental damage in order to develop preventative and ameliorative strategies. In addition, successful implementation of a preventative or ameliorative strategy requires early identification of affected individuals. Currently, there is no effective means of identifying affected children during the prenatal period. The now well established sheep model offers some unique advantages in addressing these questions. Current projects investigating possible mechanisms for the alcohol induced neurodevelopment damage seen as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure and the evaluation of potential nutritional intervention strategies will be presented, as well as the use of MRI and ultrasound to develop a set of measurements that can be used as a screening tool to identify affected children.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) refers to specific diagnoses that describe individuals who have physical, mental, behavioral, and learning disabilities as a result of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Chudley et al., 2005). Many children may be affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but may not meet all of the diagnostic criteria for FASD. Individuals with FASD display high rates of secondary disabilities including mental health issues and problems with inappropriate sexual behaviors, school, the law, and substance use (Streissguth et al. 1996). The goal of the current project was to examine secondary disabilities and detailed information on mental health problems among Canadian children with PAE and FASD and how risk and protective factors and different types of services affect these outcomes. We also compared patterns of performance between undiagnosed children with PAE and those diagnosed with FASD. Participants included 72 alcohol-exposed children (aged 6 to 17) and their caregivers: 46 were diagnosed with FASD and 26 did not have an FASD diagnosis but had PAE. Caregivers completed a questionnaire measuring secondary disabilities and risk and protective factors (e.g., exposure to violence/abuse, quality and stability of home, having basic needs met for most of life, diagnosed before age 6) adapted from Streissguth et al. (1996). Caregivers also completed the Services for Children and Adolescents-Parent Interview (SCAPI) which measures service use across ten domains, and the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2) which measures behavioral, emotional, and mental health. Both the FASD and PAE group displayed high rates of many secondary disabilities and at-risk scores on the BASC-2. An older age of assessment was associated with more mental health, behavioral, and adaptive problems on the BASC, and more school problems and inappropriate sexual behaviors. Parenting classes were associated with fewer problems with the law and school. Some other services (medication use, school services, child therapy and respite) were actually associated with worse outcomes, which likely occurred because children with more problems were receiving these services. Finally, there were no differences between children with PAE and FASD in most analyses, indicating that outcomes are quite similar among those with PAE with and without a clinical diagnosis.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), including Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE) resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure has been welldocumented in the Western world. With protective genetics (e.g., ADH2*2) in place, how FASD prevails in Eastern world has not been clear. We aim to report a prevalence study of FASD in East Taiwan. Methods: This study was performed in-school in Hualien County in East Taiwan which includes Taiwanese with ancestor of Chinese Han and aborigines with ancestor of Malaysia descent. From 1996 through 1998, data from 3817 students in 87 schools including 847 students from special schools, between 3 to 15 years old were enrolled. A three-stage evaluation process was used, including stage one: background history collection including birth weight & height, and maternal alcohol- or substance-use history during pregnancy; stage two: pediatric physical and neurological assessment including physical dysmorphism. A total of 3817 students complete the first two stages. Children with positive maternal alcohol consumption history and pre- or post-natal growth delay or facial/body dysmorphic characteristics, received stage three:-developmental or cognitive assessment. All the subjects were reviewed by pediatric geneticists, neurologists and psychologists on the same day. Results: Among participants with reported alcohol exposure during pregnancy, we confirmed seven children (1.83 per 1000 live births, 4 boys and 3 girls) with severe form described in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and fifteen (3.93 per 1000 live births, 9 boys and 6 girls) with alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficit without all facial dysmorphic features. With 300-character space, do you plan to add the numbers in special schools? Children with FAS had smaller head circumstance, lower body weight and lower body height than those with FAE. Also, children with FAS scored lower on intelligence tests than did children with non-FAS FASD. Conclusion: Using active case ascertainment in general schools and special schools, this study reported estimates of the prevalence of FASD in East Taiwan. Although with protective gene in Asian population, a comparable prevalence of FASD in East Taiwan is observed comparable to that of the Western world.

N2  - Children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure show reduced control of isometric (IM) and isotonic (IT) force as well as brain structural abnormalities in regions known to be involved in motor control, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. However, the relationship between regulation of motor force and neuroanatomical impairments has not been explored in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Prior studies have evaluated deficits in force regulation in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, and this study extended those studies by examining regional brain volumes associated with IM and IT force regulation in the same cohort of participants. Children with (ALC=9) and without (CON=7) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, who previously received assessment of force regulation, underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Measures of force regulation previously reported to differ between groups-response accuracy, response variability, and signal complexity-were correlated with regional brain volume after correcting for total intracranial volume; significant correlations were followed-up with multiple regression to control for age. In the ALC group, greater IM signal complexity was associated with smaller volume of the inferior parietal (IP) region, and greater IT response variability was correlated with larger volume of the anterior midbody of the corpus callosum. In the CON group, greater IT response variability and signal complexity was related to larger volumes in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, respectively. Findings provide a link between brain structure and force regulation and suggest altered influences of brain development on force production in alcohol-exposed children. Reductions in brain volume as a result of prenatal exposure to alcohol likely contribute to deficits in regulation of motor force in this clinical population. Force regulation is an important control parameter involved in complex movement, and the continued use of neuroimaging methods will help elucidate the relationships between brain and motor development in children with FASD.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a major, preventable cause of neurobehavioural and cognitive deficits in children. The developing brain is the principal target organ for gestational alcohol exposure. The full spectrum includes several diagnostic subgroups, and is collectively referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). There is a clear need to develop new tools for assessing brain function in the FASD population. Measurement of eye movement control is a powerful tool for assessing cognitive, sensory and motor function. Objective: To utilize standardized psychometric tests and measures of saccadic eye movement control to identify brain dysfunction in children with FASD. Methods: In this multi-centre study, each child completed a battery of psychometric tests and a set of structured saccadic eye movement tasks. The psychometric battery measured executive function, working memory, short-term memory, visuospatial skills, language and math ability. Depending on age, each child completed structured eye movement tasks that assessed sensory motor integration, response inhibition, cognitive flexibility and spatial working memory. Results: Preliminary analysis of both sets of tasks revealed significant differences between children with FASD and typically developing children. In both the pro- and antisaccade tasks, the children with FASD display significantly more hypometric initial saccades, which required a greater number of additional saccades per trial to arrive at the target. Also in the prosaccade task, the accuracy of the saccades were significantly poorer in children with FASD compared to controls. The children with FASD made significantly more direction errors in the antisaccade task. In the memory guided task, the children with FASD made significantly more timing errors, and also exhibited decreased accuracy in the task. Analysis of the data from the psychometric battery has revealed that the children with FASD scored significantly lower on every subtest administered except the NEPSY-II arrows task, a test of visuospatial processing. This result suggests that the deficits in eye movement control cannot be attributed to a general deficit in visuospatial processing capability. Conclusions: This study will provide greater insight into the motor and cognitive domains that are assessed using eye movement tasks, and will generate new knowledge that better defines the relationship between brain injury and behaviour in children with FASD.

N2  - Objectives: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis, and this may underlie some of the behavioural and adaptive problems in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol show increased basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond infancy. We have completed a 3-year study on the effects of a strength-based, motor skill development program for children with FASD. Our hypothesis is that improvements in the motor domain will extend to other domains, and affect behaviour and adaptive functioning, possibly through effects on the HPA system. Our objectives were to determine the effect of the program on the HPA system (as indicated by salivary cortisol levels), and to compare cortisol levels of children with FASD to that of control children. Methods: Twenty-seven children (age 6-14 y) participated in an 8-week motor skill development program consisting of 2 x 1.5 hour sessions/week. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 24 children (FASD group) and compared at 4 time points: before, immediately after, 2 months, and 1 year after program completion. Cortisol levels were also compared to 32 control children (C group, no FASD) to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: wake-up, after school, and just before bedtime. Results: Salivary cortisol levels showed significant (p's<0.05) diurnal variation in all children, being higher at wake-up, compared with after school and bedtime, and higher after school compared to bedtime. Cortisol levels did not vary significantly over the 4 time points in the C or FASD groups, indicating that there was no effect of the motor skill program on cortisol levels. When the time points were combined, cortisol levels were significantly higher in the afternoon (p=0.033) and at bedtime (p=0.026), but not at wake-up, in children with FASD, compared with controls. Conclusions: These results indicate that cortisol levels are elevated throughout the day in children with FASD, possible due to increased basal levels and/or an increased response to daily stressors. Importantly, these results indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure has longterm effects on the HPA system in humans, which could increase vulnerability to mental health issues and chronic disease.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with an increased incidence of psychopathology in children and adults. The aim of this study was to determine whether early indicators of affect disturbance are seen in infants exposed prenatally to alcohol. We hypothesized that (1) prenatal alcohol exposure is related to greater infant withdrawal and to alterations in infant temperament; (2) the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on withdrawal and temperament are independent of each other and independent of maternal depression and postnatal maternal alcohol use, and (3) the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on cognitive function at 5 years will be mediated, in part, by affective disturbance in infancy as assessed by withdrawal and temperament. The Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort consists of 159 mothers and infants from the Cape Coloured (mixed race) community in Cape Town, South Africa, a large proportion of whom were exposed to alcohol during gestation. Mothers were interviewed about their alcohol consumption using a timeline follow-back approach to determine frequency and amount of drinking on a day-by-day basis. The Alarm Distress Baby Scale (ADBB) of Guerdeney and Fermanian (2001), which assesses sustained affective withdrawal behaviour, was administered at 6.5 months postpartum, and the mothers were interviewed on the Buss and Plomin (1984) EAS Temperament scale at 13 months. At the 5-year follow-up, the Junior South African Intelligence Scales (IQ) assessment was administered, and the EAS interview was repeated. ADBB withdrawal was associated with reduced activity on the EAS (r = -.29, p < .01) but was not related to emotionality, shyness, or sociability. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with greater ADBB affective withdrawal (r = .30, p < .01) and lower EAS activity (r = -.23, p < .01). These effects were independent of each other, and both remained significant after controlling for postnatal maternal alcohol use and depression. Mediation of the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on 5-year IQ by the ADBB fell just short of statistical significance (Sobel z = -1.34, p = .085), suggesting that affective withdrawal that is already evident in infancy contributes to poorer cognitive function at school entry.

N2  - A key component of this NIAAA-funded study to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in the Western Cape Province of South Africa is to contact women on their first visit to the antenatal clinics for an assessment of drinking levels during their current pregnancy and therefore, the risk for producing a child with an FASD. Antenatal clinics are usually held over four days of each week in different locations in our prevention and comparison communities. Since late 2008 through June 2011, 2,550 women have been contacted and enrolled. Seventy-nine percent of the women were "Coloured" (a proper South African term meaning of mixed racial ancestry), 18% were Black, and 3% were White. Generally, these women were extremely positive and open to the brief intervention about the risks of drinking during their pregnancy. In fact, the women who attend these clinics are used to long periods of waiting, and very little time is actually spent with health care workers. The fact that our staff spent time with these women made the women feel special, and the individual attention given to everyone contributed to the success of these efforts. Two instruments are used to assess the use or abuse of alcohol, the Alcohol Use Questionnaire (AUDIT), and the Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ). After completing the assessment tools, any risky drinking behavior was discussed with the women in a non-judgmental manner, and every woman was motivated by receiving factual, prevention information and informed that stopping drinking at any time during the pregnancy would benefit their baby. In the prevention community, if a woman was consuming alcohol in a risky manner, our staff member invited the women to become involved in the case management component of our study. Women in the comparison communities are referred to Provincial health officials or non-governmental organizations. Data analysis continues.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are caused by the deleterious effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. FASD's are the most common environmentally induced form of mental retardation in the world, potentially affecting 1% of all children born in the United States. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most clinically recognizable form of FASD and is characterized by a pattern of minor facial anomalies, prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, and functional or structural central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. However, the effects of alcohol on the developing fetus represent a continuum, with full-blown FAS merely the "tip of the iceberg." The highest documented prevalence of FAS in the world has been documented to be 80 per 1,000 in the mixed race population of the Western Cape Province in South Africa. The consequences of FASD are life long, and the behavioral and learning difficulties are often greater than the degree of neurocognitive impairment. Thus, early diagnosis and referral for early intervention services is imperative. However, while application of diagnostic guidelines for FASD in older children and adolescents can be difficult, diagnosis in the infant is rarely attempted because of the lack of documented specificity of the phenotype in the newborn. Yet, identification and referral within the first few months of life may represent the most crucial time in the affected child's lifespan for initiation of early intervention services. Between October 2008 and May 2011 NIAAA-funded researchers investigated predictors of FASD and developmental outcome in early infancy in a cohort of 965 alcohol-exposed and unexposed infants prospectively ascertained during pregnancy. We utilized three methodologies to approach this issue: growth and standardized dysmorphology assessment of subjects and controls at birth, 6 weeks, 9 months and 18 month intervals, respectively; standardized developmental assessments (using age appropriate assessment tools) at the same intervals; and digital photography at each interval.

N2  - Purpose: The Hawai'i Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Task Force was initiated less than a decade ago as a primary entity to help plan, guide, facilitate, and oversee statewide initiatives in the education and awareness, screening, identification, prevention, interventions, and services related to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. An historical assessment of the Task Force activities was conducted to map the challenges and progress made in the goal of building a comprehensive statewide system for FASD. Method: Archived documents from the Task Force and the Hawai'i Department of Health were examined, (e.g., PRAMS and Birth Defects Reports), and informal face-to-face or phone interviews were conducted (e.g., State FASD Coordinator, other agency collaborators). These sources provided quantitative and qualitative information about the Task Force's planned or prioritized, and implemented activities, as well as the major outcomes, challenges, and successes. Results: Though an iterative process, the Task Force has conducted needs assessments, strategic planning, and prioritized inter-agency and multi-sectoral collaborative activities, reflecting incremental gains in expanding initiatives in prevention, screening, public awareness, and education and training over time. The creation of a State FASD Coordinator position within the past several years was significant in catalyzing increased and sustained support for FASD initiatives and extending collaborative networks with national experts/teams, community-based organizations, and other local agencies to leverage resources in a time of economic strain. Needs assessments by the state and other community data indicate that prenatal alcohol use is significant, and that health, educational, and social services seek education and training opportunities to address the issues of FASDs in practice. Recent efforts have looked to develop or enhance foundations in a systematic and collaborative approach for currently challenging areas such as data and surveillance, research, and education and training to help improve screening, identification and prevention systems. Conclusion: A strategic and informed approach to building a statewide comprehensive system can become an iterative and resource-dependent process. Key leadership, stakeholder commitment and support, and prioritization by the state is essential in order to continue to make progress and drive policy directions to reduce and prevent FASDs in Hawai'i.

N2  - South Africa has the highest recorded prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in the world. Caused by maternal drinking, FAS is preventable and characterized by unique facial features, growth retardation, and developmental delays. Case management (CM) can help women access resources needed to reduce drinking or increase abstention from alcohol during pregnancy. In this study, CM is designed to determine whether the rate of FASD can be reduced over time, focusing on indicated prevention to provide support to women who are known to drink heavily during pregnancy. CM was implemented by trained project officers using Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) techniques to encourage positive changes in drinking habits. MI is a person-centred therapy that elicits and strengthens motivation for change. CRA is an evidence-based behavioral approach for treating substance abuse problems to assist clients in maintaining a sober lifestyle. Data for the initial participants (n = 30; 97% Coloured, 3% Black) indicated risk factors commonly associated with maternal drinking and FASD, including young age at time of pregnancy (= 24.3 years), low education (= < 8th grade), low religiousity (> 33% report never attending church), and unemployment (>75% do not work for money). The majority (69%) of the sample report that half or more of their current friends drink alcohol. Ninety percent believed they were pregnant at the time of intake. Nearly half (48%) report their lives to be very or extremely stressful, and at intake, nearly half (42% a very high percentage in this South African population) believed they currently had a drinking problem. Mean AUDIT scores show significant improvement from baseline to 6 month follow-up (20.3 down to 9.7). Measures for total drinks consumed on weekends, total drinks over the past seven days, and total number of drinking days in the past week, were also reduced. Results show the efficacy of CM, while also showing the difficulty of making enduring change in an environment where weekend drinking for recreation and sociability remains popular. CM for prevention is useful to help women abstain or reduce their alcohol intake during pregnancy. Data gathering and analysis continues.

N2  - In general, females in Asian countries consume less alcohol than those from Western countries although alcohol consumption among females in Korea have been increasing. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a serious consequence of drinking during pregnancy and little information is available on the rates of FAS in Asian countries. This study estimated the prevalence of FAS in South Korea using an active case ascertainment approach in two different settings, general schools (N=12) and institutions for children with intellectual disability (N=8). Within the general schools 7,785 children were screened on height and weight and those falling under the 10th percentile were selected for subsequent physical examination (n=224), including a dysmorphology assessment. Intellectual function and attention capabilities were examined by utilizing a standardized neurocognitive test, WISC-III(Wechsler Inteligence Scale for Children, 3th ed.)and computerized continuous performance test. Parental interviews were conducted to obtain information about maternal drinking history. In the institutional settings, physical exams, including the dysmorphology assessment were performed on all children. In the general schools the prevalence of FAS was 0.28%, whereas in the institutions for intellectual disability the prevalence was 14.9%. These rates are not dissimilar to those reported in western countries. These data extend extremely limited studies on the prevalence of FAS in S. Korea and demonstrate the need for increased screening and diagnoses of FAS in various community and clinical settings.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can significantly damage the developing brain. Because the exact nature of the damage can depend upon the amount consumed, and the time it is consumed during the pregnancy, the damage can manifest in wide array of disorders that are grouped under the term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). One problem consistently observed in FASD is an impairment in learning and memory processes, particularly those that involve the functioning of the hippocampal formation. Experimentally we can study deficits caused by FASD by looking at long-term potentiation (LTP), a biological model of learning and memory that is easily observed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In this study we have observed deficits in LTP in anaesthetized adult males that have been exposed to alcohol prenatally. Biochemical analyses of the brains of these animals revealed that these deficits in LTP were also accompanied by reductions in neuronal antioxidants; in particular glutathione. To try and ameliorate the deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, we gave animals' access to a diet supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for membrane fluidity and participate in many signaling cascades in the brain. They are also associated with preventing neurocognitive decline, decreasing inflammation, and reducing indications of depression. In the present study we show that Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in FASD newborns completely rescues deficits in LTP and increases glutathione levels into adulthood. Furthermore, glutathione depletion itself can mimic the effects of FASD for LTP, indicating that a reduction in glutathione alone can significantly impair the functional capacity of synapses. These results indicate that omega-3 fatty acids may be an important addition to the diet of children suffering from FASD and may be able to "rescue" the deficits in learning and memory common with this disorder.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol has been linked to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) which encompasses various developmental deficits, including cardinal brain retardation. Although many mechanisms (e. g. oxidative stress, apoptosis) have been studied, how alcohol leads to neurodevelopmental disorders remains elusive. We have recently proposed that alcohol, acting as a methyl donor suppressor, interferes with DNA methylation, which we have further demonstrated to play a permissive role during neural tube differentiation. This study aims to examine the role of the DNA methylation in cerebellar development and the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure. Using a mouse model of prenatal alcohol exposure (liquid, 4% v/v, administered across gestational period E7-17, pups reared by surrogate foster mothers) as well as isocaloric pair-fed and control animals, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of the DNA methylation marker 5-methylcytosine (5meC) and a recently identified derivative, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) across critical periods of postnatal cerebellar development (P7, P21, P28). We observed that the methylation of two major classes of cells, Purkinje and granule, are unique and transition through methylation and de-methylation states across development. Additionally, subpopulations of granule cells exhibit distinct DNA Methylation Programs, or DMPs, relative to their mitotic and migrational status (P7). Alcohol has been previously shown to delay migration of granule cells from the external layer to their internal layer position. The results of our alcohol treatment further show that granule cell DMP is concordantly hindered. Taken together our study concludes that the DMP of the cerebellum is timely and cell-specific and can be altered by moderate fetal alcohol exposure. Further, this study suggests a novel mechanism for the inhibited migration of granule cells of the cerebellum upon fetal alcohol exposure and provides support for the idea that alcohol can exploit epigenetic machinery to alter transcriptional regulation during neurodevelopment-a focus of our forthcoming work.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are characterized by attention deficits. The current study examined the nature and specificity of these deficits by comparing performance of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) to non-exposed controls using a measure based on a strong theoretical model of attention functioning (e.g., Posner et al., 2006). Methods: Subjects (8-12y, M=10.99) comprised two groups: children with AE (N=27) and typically developing controls (CON, N=26). Groups were matched on age, sex, handedness, race/ethnicity, and SES. Subjects were administered the attention network test, a computerized task that examines three independent but interrelated networks of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Data were analyzed using a 2 (group) x 3 (network) repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Results indicate that children with AE were impaired on alerting and executive control aspects of attention. Omnibus tests revealed significant main effects of network (F (2,102) = 12.89, p < .001) and a network X group interaction (F (2,102)= 3.89, p = .024). The main effect of group was not significant (F (1,51) = 0.28, p = .560). Pairwise comparisons indicated that the AE group was significantly worse on alerting (p = .035) and marginally worse on executive control (p = .052) networks than the CON group. There were no group differences on orienting attention in this sample (p = .821). In addition, as a preliminary investigation, a small group of subjects with ADHD were tested and compared to children with AE. These limited data suggest that the two clinical groups can be differentiated on executive control of attention (p = .050) but were similar on the orienting and alerting networks. Conclusion: Findings suggest that children with AE are impaired in distinct aspects of attention function. Specifically, children with AE show impairment in alerting and executive control attention networks. Evaluation of underlying mechanisms of attention allows for greater understanding of brain regions affected by AE and suggests that areas in the frontal and parietal cortical sites (alerting) and areas in the cingulate gyrus and some lateral prefrontal areas (executive control) might be especially affected in these children.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are characterized by attention deficits. The current study examined the nature and specificity of these deficits by comparing neural activation of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) to non-exposed controls during a measure based on a strong theoretical model of attention functioning (e.g., Posner et al., 2006). Method: Subjects (13-16y, M=15.10) comprised two groups: children with AE (N=24) and typically developing controls (CON, N=9). Groups were matched on age, sex, handedness, race/ethnicity, and SES. During fMRI, subjects were administered the attention network test, a computerized task that examines three independent but interrelated networks of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Data were analyzed using independent sample ttests. Results: Groups did not differ on task accuracy; however, the CON had overall faster reaction times compared to the AE group (p < .05). Statistically significant group differences in BOLD response were observed in all three attention networks (cluster size > 1,000 microl; p < .05). In the alerting network, the CON group showed greater BOLD response than the AE group in the bilateral superior/middle and inferior temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and left postcentral gyrus, whereas, the AE group showed greater BOLD response in regions of the medial frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and right paracentral lobule. In the orienting network, the AE group had greater activation mainly in areas of the inferior and middle frontal gyri and the middle temporal gyrus. During the executive network condition the CON group had greater activation in parietal regions, while children in the AE group showed greater activation in the cuneus, posterior cingulate, superior and middle temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Conclusions: Results support prior findings suggesting that attention may be particularly sensitive to the teratogenic effects of AE and further indicate that distinct neural mechanisms underlie the attention network in children with AE compared to nonexposed typically developing peers. In the majority of the clusters, children in AE group showed greater activation, which may result from atypical neuroadaptive processes or brain alterations.

N2  - Verbal and visuospatial learning and memory have been extensively studied in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Previous studies have shown deficits in learning in both domains. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamics of verbal and visuospatial learning in children with FASD from Cape Town, South Africa. The sample was comprised of 59 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) children who are participating in the 9-year follow-up of a longitudinal FASD study, comprised of children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (PFAS), heavy exposed (HE) nonsyndromal children, and controls. Children were administered a visuospatial associative learning test and the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), a test of episodic learning. Learning rates were estimated by fitting negatively accelerated response functions (y=1-e-kx) to each child's performance across trials on each learning task. Significant differences in learning rate were found on the CVLT-C [F(2, 51) = 5.03; p < .01] with those in the FAS/PFAS and HE groups showing slower learning rates than controls (both ps < .05). A marginally significant difference in learning rate was found on the visuospatial associative learning task [F(2, 49) = 3.01; p = .059] with those in the FAS/PFAS group having slower learning rates than the HE group (p < .05). Significant differences in peak performance (capacity) were found on the CVLT-C [F(2, 51) = 5.83; p < .01] with those in the FAS/PFAS and HE groups showing less learning capacity than controls (both ps < .05). No exposure group differences in capacity were found on the visuospatial associative learning task [F(2,49) = 0.15; n.s.]. These data indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure affects learning rates similarly in both tasks, but only episodic learning capacity is vulnerable, while associative learning is spared. The finding of deficits in learning rates in both tasks suggests a non-specific impairment in information processing and integration related to prenatal alcohol exposure. The finding that capacity was affected on the episodic recall task suggests that fetal alcohol exposure may affect the interaction of hippocampal and frontal regions, which is necessary for episodic recall. No capacity deficits were found on the associative learning task, which is primarily dependent on hippocampal activity alone.

N2  - Cognitive impairment in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is most severe in children who meet diagnostic criteria for full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), but significant deficits are also seen in non-syndromal heavily-exposed (HE) children. Using fMRI, we recently found differences in working memory-related cortico-striatal-cerebellar activation between syndromal and non-syndromal alcohol-exposed children (Diwadkar et al., 2012). But effects on regional brain interactions have not previously been investigated in FASD. In this study, we used psycho-physiological interaction (Friston et al., 1997), a seed-based method for assessing modulatory interactions between brain regions. We hypothesized that prenatal alcohol exposure would affect the degree to which the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), an important cognitive control region, modulates activity in fronto-striatal-cerebellar regions known to mediate working memory. A verbal 1-back task was administered to 47 children (17 with FAS/PFAS, 13 HE, and 17 controls; age 8.9-10.6 yr). In the 1-back condition, the child presses the left key if the letter appearing on the screen is the same as the previous letter; the right key, if it is not. In 0-back, s/he presses the left key to the letter D; otherwise, the right. Time series from the dACC (p<.05, effects of interest) were convolved with the psychological contrast of interest (1-back > 0-back) to investigate modulatory effects of the dACC. Inter-group differences were evaluated in a second level analysis of variance. When compared with controls, the FAS/PFAS group showed significantly greater modulation by the dACC of several brain regions known to mediate working memory, including dorsal prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Similar, albeit somewhat weaker, effects were seen in the HE group. These data suggest that fetal alcohol exposure disrupts the efficiency of cortico-striatal-cerebellar function, so that greater modulation by a key executive control region is required to perform a simple 1-back task. This increased executive control may constitute a compensatory mechanism for functional deficits in the regions that mediate working memory.

N2  - The idea that exposure to adverse environmental conditions and lifestyle choices during pregnancy can result in fetal programming that underlies disease susceptibility in adulthood is now widely accepted. One area that has not been well studied is the impact of maternal alcohol abuse on the offspring's susceptibility to cancer. We have recently shown that fetal alcohol exposure altered mammary gland morphology with a characteristic of the hyperproliferative state prior to puberty. When fetal alcohol exposed rats were treated with a carcinogen, they showed a higher incidence of mammary tumors and progressed more frequently to a malignant phenotype. We hypothesized that higher cancer incidence in fetal alcohol exposed offspring might be a result of an abnormality in the physiological process(s) that prevents cancer development. It has been suggested that the effect of stress on the immune system may in turn affect the growth of some tumors. We have previously shown that a set of hormone secreting nerve cells in the hypothalamus, called beta-endorphin (BEP) neurons, plays a role in regulating stress response and immune function. Hence, we tested whether fetal alcohol exposure increases the incidence of tumor colonization of a breast adenocarcinoma cell line, and whether transplantation of BEP neurons affects tumor colonization in these fetal alcohol exposed rats. Pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats were fed with rat chow (Ad Lib), alcohol containing diet (Alcohol-fed), or an isocaloric liquid diet (Pair-fed). Their female offspring were transplanted with either BEP neurons or cortical cells as control. They were then inoculated with MADB106 cells in the jugular vein. Animals were sacrificed 4 weeks later and tumor granules in the lungs were counted. After tumor inoculation, fetal alcohol exposed rat had more tumor colonization in the lung comparing to ad lib and pair-fed animals. BEP transplantation reduced the stress hormone level of fetal alcohol exposed rats, and significantly prevented the appearance of tumor granules in the lung of control animals as well as fetal alcohol exposed animals. These data can be interpreted as preliminary evidence that a loss of BEP control of cancer cell clearance may be a cause for the increased cancer susceptibility in fetal alcohol animals. Furthermore, the data identify the potential use of BEP cell therapy for breast cancer prevention.

N2  - Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, one of the major regulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, immune functions and energy homeostasis, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of fetal alcohol exposure. This vulnerability is manifested by hypermethylation of POMC gene promoter with a deficit in POMC gene expression and a decrease in protein levels of its derived opioid peptide beta-endorphin. We previously demonstrated that fetal alcohol exposure significantly decreased the protein levels of the activation mark H3K4me3 and increased the protein levels of the repressive mark H3K9me2 in beta-endorphin-producing POMC neurons. In this study, we specifically investigated if this deficit in gene expression and beta-endorphin peptide production is also mediated by modulation of histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 along POMC gene in fetal alcohol exposed offspring. The spatial distribution of histone marks along a gene body plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and gene expression. We found by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) that fetal alcohol exposure from gestational days GD7- GD21 decreased in exposed male and female adult rats the occupancy of H3K4me3 along Exon 3 of POMC gene. Although the level of H3K9me2 was higher in alcohol exposed rats compared to controls, the occupancy of this mark was low and did not change significantly along Exon 3 or along POMC gene promoter in control and treated rats. Interestingly, the occupancy of the mutually exclusive histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 changed in opposite direction as expected along Exon 3 of POMC gene. Overall, this study shows a distinctive spatial distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 along POMC gene that reflects the modulation of POMC chromatin landscape in response to prenatal alcohol exposure. The reduction of H3K4me3 along Exon 3 of POMC gene could modulate the efficiency of Exon 3 splicing. This could be one of the causes of the decrease in generation of functional POMC transcripts and in production of functional beta-endorphin peptides from hypothalamic POMC gene.

N2  - Purpose: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine annual trends in the prevalence of any alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant and non-pregnant women aged 18-44 between 2006 and 2010. Additionally, patterns of binge episodes and maximum alcoholic beverages consumed on a single occasion were explored. Methods: Five years of data, collected from 2006 through 2010, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were combined and analyzed. The study population included 13,880 pregnant and 331,196 non-pregnant women aged 18-44. Annual and fiveyear prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking (defined as four or more drinks on one occasion) in the past 30 days were calculated for pregnant and non-pregnant women. The average number of binge drinking episodes and the average maximum number of drinks consumed on one occasion in the past 30 days among binge drinkers were also estimated. Results: The estimated prevalence of any alcohol use from 2006-2010 among pregnant women and non-pregnant women was 7.6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 6.9-8.4) and 51.5% (95% CI = 51.2-51.8), respectively. The estimated prevalence of binge drinking from 2006-2010 among pregnant women and non-pregnant women was 1.1% (95% CI = 0.8-1.4) and 13.5% (95% CI = 13.2-13.7), respectively. There was little annual change in either set of prevalence estimates over the five years of data collection. The reported average number of binge drinking episodes was only slightly lower among pregnant women compared to nonpregnant women (2.5 vs. 3.0, respectively). The average maximum number of alcoholic beverages consumed on one occasion was found to be 6.2 drinks among both pregnant and non-pregnant women who binge. Conclusion: The relatively stable prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking from 2006 to 2010 among women of childbearing age indicate that continued efforts are necessary to address this public health concern and further reduce FASD risk. Women who binge drink appear to binge with similar frequency and intensity, regardless of pregnancy status. Women who binge drink are an important population for targeted interventions. Increasing screening and brief intervention may help to address this issue.

N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy causes to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), with varying degrees of neurodevelopment deficits. Proper DNA methylation which regulates gene repression is now known as a prerequisite for zygote differentiation, early development, tissue specification. We previously reported that DNA methylation is a program (DMP) which parallel to embryonic maturation during early neural tube development, and, alcohol exposure delayed this DMP along with retarded embryonic growth. To further understanding the methyl binding protein which connection between DNA methylation and gene expression in DMP, we studied the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 (MBD1). To mimic similar patterns of brain damage known to occur when pregnant women drink alcohol in chronic and in binge drinking pattern, we employed Liquid Diet [LD; 4% v/v alcohol on gestational (E) days 7 to E17; BAC 100-200mg/dL, analyzed at E17] and Vapor Chamber (VC, 6hrs of 300mg/dL beginning at E8 and harvest at E10) model of alcohol administration. Alcohol in LD paradigm, reduced the brain weights on E17, and markedly delayed the hippocampus development and a significant reduction in cortex thickness. In the VC model, alcohol caused embryonic growth retardation as indicated by Van Farber scoring system. Through immunostaining, we found that the MeCP2 and MBD1 exhibited reversed expression patterns. As compared to controls, a marked increase of immunointensity and number of MeCP2+ cells, while a significant decrease in immunointensity and number of MBD1+ cells were found in the developing hippocampal and migratory cortical areas. A similar finding was observed in VC binge model showing the marked increase of MeCP2 and decrease of MBD1 in the fore- and hindbrain regions of telencephalic wall, optic and otic vesicles, and first branchial arch in the alcohol treated E10 embryos. Through both chronic and binge models, we showed for the first time that alcohol-induced a contrast change of MeCP2 and MBD1 which correlated with neural developmental delay. This finding strongly supports our previous observation on alcohol disrupted DMP. Furthermore, since MeCP2 and MBD1 are functioning in mediate the DNA methylation to gene repression, the consequence of their alteration further signifies the altered DMP hypothesis on alcohol induced neurodevelopment deficit.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defect and neurobehavioral disorders in humans. In the most severe cases, these abnormalities make up a pattern of malformations termed fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). This syndrome is associated with high prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and hearing disorders in neonates and children. Thus, alcohol exposure in utero is a potential factor for the etiology and mechanisms of enhanced seizure susceptibility in neonates with FAS. Evidence indicates that rodent subjected to gestational alcohol exposure exhibit altered auditory brainstem responses, which lasted into adulthood. The inferior colliculus (IC), the generator of auditory brainstem responses wave V, plays a critical role in the initiation of tonic-clonic seizures following alcohol withdrawal. Thus, alcohol-induced changes in IC neuronal excitability may contribute to the mechanisms of enhanced seizure susceptibility associated with FAS. Here, we examined the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on firing and voltageactivated Ca2+ channel (Cav) currents in dissociated IC neurons obtained from neonatal rat offspring (P3-P7). Pregnant rats received a single dose of 5 g/kg body weight ethanol (95%) as a 30% (v/v) solution in Isomil by gastric intubation at gestational day 18. Control animals received only Isomil. IC neurons were recorded in whole cell patch clamp configuration for current- and voltage-clamp experiments. Cav currents were measured using 5 mM Ca2+. Quantification shows that prenatal alcohol exposure elicits the occurrence of >2 action potentials (APs) evoked by depolarizing current injections. Such elevated responses were not seen in control IC neurons which only exhibited a single AP. Increasing extracellular (from 2 mM to 5 mM) Ca2+ concentration reversibly enhanced the number of APs in control IC neurons. Quantification also shows that Cav current density was significantly elevated in IC neurons following prenatal alcohol exposure. Pharmacological analysis reveals that Cav1.2/ Cav1.3 and Cav2.3 contribute to the enhanced current density in neonatal IC neurons following prenatal alcohol exposure. These findings suggested that altered Cav1.2/Cav1.3 and Cav2.3 signaling may play important roles in the pathophysiology of FAS-associated diseases of neuronal excitability.

N2  - The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code is a rigorous FASD diagnostic protocol based on measurements of growth, face, brain damage, and prenatal alcohol exposure (Astley, 2004). To date only one study in Washington is known to describe the characteristics of persons screened for FASD based on the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code criteria (Astley, 2010). This paper provides comparative data to begin to explore the validity and discuss the consistency of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code criteria by examining 863 cases from Minnesota. Five Minnesota clinics were involved in the data collection efforts related to the FASD screening. Two clinics were in Minneapolis, two in northern Minnesota and one was in the southeast region of the state. The data are based on chart reviews of patients who were screened for FASD in 2001 to 2003. Prior to this study two of the five clinics were involved in the diagnosis of FASD. The other three clinics received training from staff at the University of Minnesota and the University of Washington. The sample included 863 persons who had been referred to one of five Minnesota FASD diagnostic clinics. Most of the 863 cases (795; 92.4%) were 18 years or younger and confirmed to be born in the United States (662; 76.7%). The cases were predominately white (44.0%) and non- Hispanic (98.5%). Of those cases where the mothers' age at birth was known (55.4%), almost half of the participants were born to mothers who were 25 years or younger at the time of the birth. 164 (19.0%) of the cases were diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome [FAS/PFAS], 295 (34.3%) with static encephalopathy [SE], and 174 (20.2%) with neurodevelopmental disorder [ND]. Of the remaining cases, 30 (3.5%) did not receive a FASD related diagnosis and 197 (22.8%) did not fall within the four digit code diagnostic area; and 135 had the unknown history of alcohol exposure [AE]. Examination of comorbidity by diagnostic status revealed significant differences in the distribution of ADHD, conduct disorder/ODD, learning disorders, mental retardation, and anxiety disorder by FASD diagnosis. In general FAS/PFAS and Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed diagnoses had the greater prevalence of these four additional diagnoses. This report documents the characteristics of person screened for FASD using the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. Future comparative studies across states (e.g., Minnesota and Washington) should be pursued to further validate the diagnostic tool.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) persists as a major public health concern. Confidence in diagnosis for "non-FAS" FASD is limited by the absence of facial features and by variable neurobehavioral effects. Our goal is to identify an "epigenetic" profile as a pattern of DNA methylation in infant blood that is a valid biomarker of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a sensitive predictor of neurobehavioral outcomes that together may aid in early detection and diagnosis of FASD. Methods. Subjects from a large prospective pregnant African American cohort with assessments of maternal alcohol use beginning at the first antenatal visit were selected based on our validated metric of prenatal "at-risk alcohol exposure" (Chiodo et al., 2009) and available subsequent neurobehavioral assessment. With maternal consent, infant heel-stick "blood spots" were obtained from the Michigan Neonatal BioBank archive for 5 at-risk PAE infants and 7 non-exposed infant controls. DNA was extracted, subjected to bisulfite conversion, hybridized to an Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, fluorescent stained, scanned, and whole-genome CpG methylation status for >27,000 sites determined. Differentially methylated sites were filtered with a cut-point at p<0.01. Results. At-risk PAE was associated with a set of significantly hypermethylated DNA sites in dried infant blood. Among the 50 most differentially methylated sites, all 5 PAE infants had 9 to 15 to hypermethylated sites whereas 5 of 7 non-exposed infants had zero. The other two non-exposed controls had only 2 or 3 (chi2=12.0, p=.007). No sites were significantly hypomethylated after PAE. The degrees of DNA hypermethylation in many of these same sites were correlated significantly with memory, behavior and fine motor problems (but few with birth weight or IQ) in these children at 4 years of age. DNA hypermethylation was also related to other measures of risk drinking (e.g., average amount of alcohol drunk per drinking day across pregnancy & the TACER-3 screen). Conclusions. Differential patterns of DNA methylation (or "epigenetic marks") in blood may effectively detect infants exposed to at-risk maternal drinking and predict life-long FASD. Other predictors, factors, genes or outcomes, as well as potential 'mechanisms of pathology' that may be indicated by which genes are altered, all remain to be determined in future analyses.

N2  - Identification of the newborn infants exposed to alcohol in utero is essential to establishing early intervention strategies. Previous studies have shown that fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), non-oxidative metabolites of alcohol, in meconium are potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure in term newborns. However, the identification of specific FAEEs and threshold concentrations of FAEEs which correlate with exposure remains under investigation. The aim of this study was to evaluate FAEEs in the meconium of infants and identify a concentration and pattern of FAEEs to serve as accurate biomarkers of in utero ETOH exposure. Pregnant women were recruited from the University of New Mexico substance abuse clinic during one of the first prenatal care visits and categorized into: a) alcohol-exposed (>1 binge episode or >3 drinks/wk on average since the last menstrual period [LMP]); and b) controls (alcohol abstainers since LMP). FAEEs were measured in the meconium of 38 infants born to cohort participants (12 exposed and 26 controls). Meconium was extracted and analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The data (ng of FAEEs/g of meconium) was not normally distributed and was therefore log-transformed and analyzed via the Mann-Whitney U test. Cut off analysis was performed using Chi-Square. FAEEs were detectable in all meconium samples. Concentrations of Stearic FAEE were elevated in alcohol-exposed infants compared to non-exposed infants (p=0.058). The set threshold of significance for the amount of FAEEs (specifically Linoleic and Linolenic) was set as greater than 10,000 ng/g of meconium. The observed difference in quantity of Linoleic and Linolenic FAEEs (ng/g of meconium sample) in control vs exposed infants could potentially trend towards significance with a larger sample number [11.5% of control infants vs. 41.6% of alcohol-exposed infants (p=0.08)]. Based on these results, infants exposed to alcohol in utero (based on maternal report) trended towards higher concentrations of Stearic in their meconium compared to control infants and they had four-fold elevated levels of Linoleic+ Linolenic ethyl esters compared to non-exposed newborns. While other investigators have shown that one FAEE (i.e. Linoleic ethyl ester) is found in higher concentrations in alcohol-exposed newborns, we have shown that a combination of FAEEs at certain threshold values holds further promise for more accurate identification of the alcohol-exposed newborns.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability. The mechanisms underlying FASD are incompletely understood, and biomarkers to identify those at risk are lacking. Here, we detail the metabolomic analysis of embryoid bodies and neural lineages derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cell, and we identify the neural secretome produced in response to ethanol exposure. Methods: WA01 and WA09 hES cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies, neural progenitors or neurons. Cells along this progression were cultured for four days with 0%, 0.1% or 0.3% ethanol. Supernatants from the last 24hr of culture were subjected to C18 chromatography followed by ESI-QTOF-MS. Features were annotated using public databases and the identities of four putative biomarkers were confirmed with purified standards and comparative MS/MS. Results: Ethanol treatment induced statistically significant changes to metabolite abundance in human embryoid bodies (180 features), neural progenitors (76 features) and neurons (42 features). There were no shared significant features between different cell types. Fifteen features showed a dose-response to ethanol. Four chemical identities were confirmed; Lthyroxine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, and the tryptophan metabolites L-kynurenine, and indoleacetaldehyde. One feature with a putative annotation of succinyladenosine was significantly increased in both ethanol treatments. Additional features were selective to ethanol treatment but were not annotated in public databases. Conclusions: Ethanol exposure induces statistically significant changes to the metabolome profile of human embryoid bodies, neural progenitors and neurons. Several of these metabolites are normally present in human serum, suggesting their usefulness as potential serum FASD biomarkers. These findings suggest the biochemical pathways that are affected by ethanol in the developing nervous system and delineate mechanisms of alcohol injury during human development.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol abuse causes important structural and functional brain defects and is the leading cause of preventable retardation in the United States. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a broad term used to describe individuals exposed prenatally to alcohol and encompasses a broad range of birth defects including facial abnormalities and learning, motor, and behavioral deficits. Despite promoting alcohol abstinence during pregnancy, the incidence of FASD has failed to decline and individuals lacking cardinal facial abnormalities and historical exposure are increasingly difficult to identify. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is readily available, provides superior brain contrast, and in previous human studies of FASD has shown significant volume reductions in various brain structures. We hypothesize that postnatal MRI derived volumetric brain measurements can predict prenatal alcohol exposure. Pregnant ewes received 2.5 g/kg alcohol (N = 5) IV three consecutive days per week from gestation day 4-41 (mimicking a binge drinking pattern in the first trimester of pregnancy) while remaining ewes were controls (N = 5). Lambs were sacrificed at 5 months of age, their brains were perfused with fixative, and MRI's were performed immediately post mortem.T1-weighted images were used to calculate cerebellar volume (Inveon Research Workplace software, Siemens). Mean cerebellar volume in controls (10,655.02 +/- 943.51mm3) did not significantly differ from the alcohol group (10,519.18 +/- 181.87 mm3) (p = .891). These MRI findings are consistent with a our previous work utilizing stereological methods on the fetal cerebellum and the same first trimester alcohol exposure. The total estimated cerebellar Purkinje cell number and Purkinje cell density decreased significantly in the alcohol group compared to the control group but no significant differences existed between cerebellar volumes. Cerebellar volume is therefore a poor predictor of first trimester alcohol exposure at this alcohol dose and pattern in sheep, but MRI derived volumetric measures of other brain structures may be beneficial and further studies are warranted. Supported by Texas A&M CVM Post Doctoral Grant (SB) and NIAAA Grant AA0171290 (TAC). All or part of this work was done in conjunction with the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), which is funded by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA).

N2  - We have reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy alters placental expression of genes associated with nervous and vascular system development. Gonzalez and colleagues have shown that daily injections of 3 g/kg ethanol in mouse dams (maternal serum ethanol concentration of ~200 mg/dL) causes striking distortions in the density and radial orientation of the cerebral cortical microvascular network in PD2-old offspring. The present study addressed two questions: 1) Does moderate maternal drinking during pregnancy alter the expression of fetal cortical genes associated with neural and vascular development in a manner similar to the changes previously observed in placenta, and 2) does more moderate ethanol exposure affect fetal cortical microvascular development? Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0% or 5% ethanol solution in 0.066% saccharin water for four hours each day throughout gestation. The mean daily ethanol consumption of 2.72 g/kg, which produces a peak maternal SEC of 84 mg/dL, did not affect maternal weight gain, litter size or birth weight. On GD20, rat placental:fetal units were removed by Caesarian section and both placenta and cerebral cortex were processed for mRNA expression array analysis. In addition, fetal frontal cortices were evaluated for vascular density in the cortical plate (CP), intermediate zone (IZ), and ventricular zone (VZ) layers. Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) significantly altered the expression of 686 genes in fetal cortex and 529 genes in placenta. Gene ontology analyses revealed a significant enrichment in genes associated with neural and vascular development in both tissue types from ethanol-exposed offspring. Ethanol exposure decreased vascular density in all three layers of cerebral cortex. The reduction was statistically significant in the ventricular zone. No changes in the radial orientation of the microvascular were observed. These results indicate that moderate levels of fetal ethanol exposure affect both the expression of genes associated with vascular development as well as the microvasculature in the developing cortex. Our data suggest that further investigation of the connection between cerebral microvascular development and neural development is warranted to uncover mechanisms of fetal alcohol-induced damage.

N2  - Introduction. Most children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy cannot be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We are investigating whether alterations in placental gene and protein expression at term may provide a reliable and sensitive diagnostic indicator of fetal alcohol exposure as well as a prognostic indicator of risk for functional brain damage leading to adverse neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes in affected offspring. We previously reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy differentially affects placental genes, including those coding for proteins associated with nervous, vascular and immune system development. In the current study, we used a combination of proteomic analyses and western blotting to confirm the identification of proteins altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy. Methods. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were assigned to one of two experimental groups. One group consumed a 5% ethanol solution (in 0.066% saccharin water) four hours each day throughout gestation, resulting in a mean maternal peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. A control group consumed a matched volume of saccharin water. At term (Gestational Day 20) placentas were harvested, saline-perfused to remove blood from the tissue, and processed for analysis of protein expression. Results. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis of placental tissue detected 1181 protein spots, twenty of which were significantly altered by maternal drinking during pregnancy. Fourteen of the altered protein spots have been identified via mass spectroscopic analysis. Some of the identified proteins play critical roles in placental and neural development, angiogenesis or apoptosis. Recently, western blotting has confirmed the ethanol-induced alterations for two of the identified proteins, namely, Annexin IV and Cerebral Cavernous Malformation Protein 3. Conclusions. These results indicate that placental proteins associated with vascular remodeling are altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy and could serve as biomarker candidates for fetal ethanol exposure and fetal ethanol effects. Further, these results provide insights on novel mechanisms of how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function.

N2  - Introduction: Craniofacial bone dysmorphology is an important but under explored diagnostic feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study aims to examine effects of dose and timing of fetal alcohol exposure on a set of craniofacial bones in a mouse model, while co-varying for the head size variation. Methods: C57BL/6J dams were randomly assigned into three different alcohol treatment groups representing two doses (high vs. low) and two timings (long vs. short) at postpregnancy: a 10-day exposure from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E16 on either 4.2% v/v (high dose long exposure, HDLE) or 3.6% v/v (low dose long exposure, LDLE) respectively, and a 5-day exposure during E7-E11 with 4.2% v/v (high dose short exposure, HDSE). A CHOW group, fed with ad libitum mouse chow and water throughout the experiment, served as the controls. The Micro-CT scan yielded volumetric data for each mouse sample with 40x40x40 um3 voxel spacing. Pups born to all treated dams were scanned at postnatal 7 day (P7) and at P21 for longitudinal studies of craniofacial bone development. Using the Amira software,17 landmarks on the craniofacial bone surfaces were defined to estimate a head size, and the frontal, parietal, occipital and mandible bones were segmented. The volumes of the four bones were analyzed using general linear model with SPSS 19 to examine effect of alcohol disposure on craniofacial bone development while controlling for the head size. Multiple comparison was corrected by the Sidak method. Results: At P7, HDSE showed less volume in all four bones than any other group (p<0.001). At P21, compared with CHOW, HDSE showed reduced volume in all four bones (p<0.027), HDLE in parietal bone only (p=0.006), and LDLE in frontal, parietal and occipital bones (p<0.03). LDLE showed less frontal bone development than HDLE (p=0.048), and HDSE showed less mandible development than HDLE (p=0.005). Conclusion: These results demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure had a dose-and timing-dependent impact on reducing craniofacial bone development after birth. And, the short exposure had an early and sustained effect on all the bones throughout the tested age range, while the long exposure affected only selected bones at a later stage. Further studies on general craniofacial measures will help delineate effects of quantity and frequency of fetal alcohol exposure to enable diagnosis of FASD.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is diagnosed using criteria of growth retardation, nervous system damage, and a distinct pattern of facial dysmorphology. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) show a wide spectrum of pathognomonic facial features that are thought to be attributed to differences in alcohol dose, or the developmental period of exposure. This study explored alcohol induced facial abnormalities attributed to varied alcohol dose and or distinct developmental periods, Using a mouse model of liquid diet alcohol exposure we examined alcohol doses of 4.0% v/v and 3.1% v/v with exposure stages from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E11 and E7-E16. Female C56BL/6J mice were divided into three groups. Chow groups were given ad libitum chow and water throughout the experimental period. The alcohol groups (Alc) were given a liquid diet of either 3.1%v/v or 4.0%v/v alcohol for 1 week prior to mating. During pregnancy the Alc groups were alcohol diet on embryonic days 7 (E7)-E11 or E7-E16. The Pair-fed (PF) dams were given equal volumes of an isocaloric diet parrelled to Alc groups. All embryos were analyzed at E17 using 15 facial measurements (derived analogs of human anthropometry), along with measures of crown-rump, weight, and head circumference. Statistical analysis was performed using both 2 and 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, testing individual treatment effects within groups and effect of stage, dose, and txt (alc vs pf). At 4.8% alcohol dose exposure stages demonstrated altered whisker pad, all facial depth measurements, and lower facial height at E7-E16 with only upper facial depth, and minimal frontal height differences within E7-E11. At 3.1% dose, differences were minimal between with dysmorpholgy of columella and philtrum at longer exposure not seen at E7-E11. Variations effected by alcohol dose were pronounced with width, height and depth measurements at 4.0% not seen at 3.1%. There were distinct difference in columella and philtrum at 3.6% not seen at the 4.0% dose comparing longer stage exposure. The dose and duration of alcohol exposure are important factors contributing to the severity of facial dysmophology and growth retardation. High dose alcohol demonstrated more dysmorphic features then lower dose, with distinct morphological changes between doses. The shorter stage (E7-E11) exposure showed less dysmorphology in both alcohol doses.

N2  - Varying brain retardation is one of the most critical features of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). MRI studies have shown regional patterns of dysmorphology including microcephaly, and altered cortical thickness, corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis structures. However, how do alcohol dose and timing affect variable brain dysfunction is not clear. Our recent studies have shown the dose- and exposure-length dependent alcohol effects on the craniofacial as well as skull bone volume developments. This study investigated how comparable the brain and craniofacial developments were impacted under the alcohol influence in the same set of mice. C57BL/6J dams were randomly assigned into three alcohol exposure (ALC) groups subjecting to 4.2% v/v (E7 - E11 or E7 - E16) or 3.6% v/v (E7 - E16) respectively. The pair-fed (PF) and CHOW groups were included to serve as non-alcohol and overall controls. On postnatal days (P) 21, mouse heads were imaged using a 9.4T preclinical MRI system with 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequence to acquire volumetric images with voxel size as low as 40 microns. Regions of interests including the whole brain, olfactory bulbs, cortex, and cerebellum were segmented and the volumes were calculated. Data was examined by ANOVA followed with paired comparison between treatment groups to test the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure.Calculating from amount of food intake, we found liquid diet group consume similar level of calories but less amount of micronutrient (<50% across the elements, e.g. iron, zinc, vitamin B1). The 4.2% ALC treated group (E7 - E16) showed consistently smaller mean volumes for brain regions measured than the other two groups, indicating that prenatal alcohol exposure hampered fetal brain development. Comparing PF with CHOW pups, only cerebellum volume was observed to be significantly different. These results suggest that alcohol and nutrition both could contribute to brain volume reduction. Alcohol under restricted micronutrient has broader impact in more brain regions. Furthermore, the effect of alcohol on brain volume reduction is dose dependent. These results are comparable with craniofacial and skull bone volume analyses performed on the same subjects. These results demonstrated that alcohol exposure led to comparable effect on brain volume reduction and degree of facial dysmorphology, and demonstrated an important information how facial dysmorphology might be a mirror of the brain in FASD.

N2  - It is critical that we better understand why there is substantial phenotypic variability following prenatal alcohol exposure. It is likely that genetic and environmental risk factors affect the degree to which prenatal alcohol exposure results in the characteristic features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Genetic screens using the zebrafish model have been particularly useful in advancing our understanding of vertebrate development. Depending upon the mutated gene, zebrafish exposed to alcohol during early embryonic development have variable craniofacial defects of the jaw, palate and skull base. Using this model, several genes within the Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathways appear to have gene x alcohol exposure interactions - suggesting that these genes may play a role in the variable effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. To further explore these genes, we utilized genotypic data from a genomewide SNP array in a sample of 240 individuals with variable alcohol exposure. All individuals completed a uniform neurobehavioral evaluation and most also had a 3D facial image. Brain (MRI) imaging was available for 70 subjects. Initial analyses were performed to evaluate 11 candidate genes in the PDGF, FGF, and BMP pathways. Analyses were limited to the Caucasian subset (n=94) due to racial differences in facial measurements. Based on the results of analyses in the zebrafish, 5 anthropometric measurements, corrected for age and gender, were initially analyzed: inner canthal width, outer canthal width, lower facial height, lower facial depth, and midfacial depth. The analytic model included the main effects of SNP genotype and prenatal alcohol exposure (Yes or No) as well as the interaction of SNP with prenatal alcohol exposure (the key variable of interest).Promising evidence of association was found with 6 SNPs in PDGFRB (genotype x exposure p < 3 x 10-3) with the phenotypes of mid and lower facial depths. One SNP in PDGFRA provided evidence of association with several anthropometric measures (p <1.7 x 10-3). Ongoing analyses are examining these candidate genes for their association with specific neurobehavioral and brain imaging phenotypes.

T1  - Assessing teratogenic changes in a zebrafish model of fetal alcohol exposure

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a severe manifestation of embryonic exposure to ethanol. It presents with characteristic defects to the face and organs, including mental retardation due to disordered and damaged brain development. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a term used to cover a continuum of birth defects that occur due to maternal alcohol consumption, and occurs in approximately 4% of children born in the United States. With 50% of child-bearing age women reporting consumption of alcohol, and half of all pregnancies being unplanned, unintentional exposure is a continuing issue. In order to best understand the damage produced by ethanol, plus produce a model with which to test potential interventions, we developed a model of developmental ethanol exposure using the zebrafish embryo. Zebrafish are ideal for this kind of teratogen study. Each pair lays hundreds of eggs, which can then be collected without harming the adult fish. The zebrafish embryo is transparent and can be readily imaged with any number of stains. Analysis of these embryos after exposure to ethanol at different doses and times of duration and application shows that the gross developmental defects produced by ethanol are consistent with the human birth defect. Described here are the basic techniques used to study and manipulate the zebrafish FAS model.

N2  - Introduction: Ethanol consumption by pregnant women can produce severe effects in the foetus and the newborn, mainly in neurological and weight-height development, and are included in the term FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder). Questionnaires are the most used screening method to detect prenatal exposure, but a previous population study questioned its reliability. The objective of this study was to compare alcohol prenatal exposure detection by questionnaire compared with biomarkers in meconium. Methodology: Sixty two meconium samples from mothers who denied alcohol consumption during pregnancy by questionnaire were analysed. The objective analysis was made by determination of FAEEs (fatty acid ethyl esters) as exposure biomarkers in meconium as biological matrix. Results: In the meconium from 10 of 62 newborns from non-alcohol consuming mothers by questionnaire (16.12%) FAEE values were positive (> 2 nmol/g). Discussion: Questionnaires as a screening method during pregnancy are not a reliable tool. It is necessary to identify prenatal exposure to alcohol as soon as possible by biomarkers analysis in biological matrices from the newborn or the mother. The early detection will allow these patients to benefit from follow up and treatment to reach the best possible neurological development. © 2012 Asociacion Espanolade Pediatria.

N2  - In this study event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on response inhibition identified during task performance. ERPs were recorded during a auditory Go/No Go task in two groups of children with mean age of 12.8 years (11 years to 14.7 years): one diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (FAS/PFAS; n = 12) and a control group of children of same age whose mothers abstained from alcohol or drank minimally during pregnancy (n = 11). The children were instructed to push a button in response to the Go stimulus and not to press the button when the No Go stimulus were heard. Task performance accuracy did not differ between the two groups, however differences were observed in the ERP components: P2, N2, and P3. The P2 amplitude were larger for Go trials in both groups. The FAS/PFAS group showed slower N2 response to Go trials, suggesting a less efficient early classification of the stimulus. P3 showed larger amplitudes to No-Go vs. Go in both groups. The study has provided new evidence for inhibition deficits in FAS/PFAS subjects identified by ERPs.

N2  - Many women continue to consume low to moderate quantities of alcohol during pregnancy, which can result in the variable neurobehavioural effects in the absence of physiological abnormalities that characterize fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Previously, we reported that a mouse model for FASD based on voluntary maternal ethanol consumption throughout gestation resulted in offspring that showed mild developmental delay, anxiety-related traits, and deficits in spatial learning. Here, we extend this model by evaluating the gene expression changes that occur in the adult brain of C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to ethanol via maternal preference drinking. The results of two independent expression array experiments indicate that ethanol induces subtle but consistent changes to global gene expression. Gene enrichment analysis showed over-represented gene ontology classifications of cellular, embryonic, and nervous system development. Molecular network analysis supported these classifications, with significant networks related to cellular and tissue development, free radical scavenging, and small molecule metabolism. Further, a number of genes identified have previously been implicated in FASD-relevant neurobehavioural phenotypes such as cognitive function (Ache, Bcl2, Cul4b, Dkc1, Ebp, Lcat, Nsdh1, Sstr3), anxiety (Bcl2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Nsdh1), and mood disorders (Bcl2, Otx2, Sstr3). The results suggest a complex residual "footprint" of neurodevelopmental ethanol exposure that may provide a new perspective for identifying mechanisms that underlie the life-long persistence of FASD-related cognitive and behavioural alterations, including potential targets for treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Ethanol Affects Differentiation-Related Pathways and Suppresses Wnt Signaling Protein Expression in Human Neural Stem Cells

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure of the fetus to ethanol (EtOH) can be teratogenic. We previously showed that EtOH alters the cell fate of human neural stem cells (NSC). As Wnt signaling plays an important role in fetal brain development, we hypothesized that EtOH suppresses Wnt signaling protein expression in differentiating NSC and thereby contributes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Methods: NSC isolated from fetal human brains were cultured in mitogenic media to induce neurospheres, which were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and used for all experiments. Equal numbers of NSC were cultured on lysine/laminin-coated plates for 96hours in differentiating media containing 0, 20, or 100mM EtOH. Total mRNA was isolated from samples containing 0 or 100mM EtOH and changes in expression of 263 genes associated with neurogenesis and NSC differentiation were determined by Oligo GEArray technology. The biological impact of gene changes was estimated using a systems biology approach with pathway express software and KEGG database. Based on the pathways identified, expression of Wnt proteins (Wnt3a and Wnt5a), Wnt-receptor complex proteins (p-LRP6, LRP6, DVL2, and DVL3), Wnt antagonist Naked-2 (NKD-2), and downstream Wnt proteins (beta-catenin, Tyr-p-GSK3beta, Ser-p-GSK3beta) were analyzed by Western blot. Results: Of the 263 genes examined, the expressions of 22 genes in differentiating NSC were either upwardly or downwardly affected by EtOH. These genes are associated with 5 pathways/cellular processes: axon guidance; hedgehog signaling; TGF-beta signaling; cell adhesion molecules; and Wnt signaling. When compared to controls, EtOH, at both 20 and 100mM concentrations, suppressed the expression of Wnt3a and Wnt5a, receptor complex proteins p-LRP6, LRP6 and DVL2, and cytoplasmic proteins Ser-p-GSK3beta and beta-catenin. Expression of NKD-2 and DVL3 remained unchanged and the expression of active Tyr-p-GSK3beta increased significantly. Conclusions: EtOH can significantly alter neural differentiation pathway-related gene expression and suppress Wnt signaling proteins in differentiating human NSC. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Structural abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC), such as reduced size and increased shape variability, have been documented in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the regional specificity of altered CC structure, which may point to the timing of neurodevelopmental disturbances and/or relate to specific functional impairments, remains unclear. Furthermore, associations between facial dysmorphology and callosal structure remain undetermined. Methods: One hundred and fifty-three participants (age range 8 to 16) including 82 subjects with FASD and 71 nonexposed controls were included in this study. The structural magnetic resonance imaging data of these subjects was collected at 3 sites (Los Angeles and San Diego, California, and Cape Town, South Africa) and analyzed using classical parcellation schemes, as well as more refined surface-based geometrical modeling methods, to identify callosal morphological alterations in FASD at high spatial resolution. Results: Reductions in callosal thickness and area, specifically in the anterior third and the splenium, were observed in FASD compared with nonexposed controls. In addition, reduced CC thickness and area significantly correlated with reduced palpebral fissure length. Conclusions: Consistent with previous reports, findings suggest an adverse effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on callosal growth and further indicate that fiber pathways connecting frontal and parieto-occipital regions in each hemisphere may be particularly affected. Significant associations between callosal and facial dysmorphology provide evidence for a concurrent insult to midline facial and brain structural development in FASD. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Accumulating evidence from structural brain imaging studies on individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has supported links between prenatal alcohol exposure and brain morphological deficits. Although global and regional volumetric reductions appear relatively robust, the effects of alcohol exposure on cortical thickness and relationships with facial dysmorphology are not yet known. The structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 69 children and adolescents with FASD and 58 nonexposed controls collected from 3 sites were examined using FreeSurfer to detect cortical thickness changes across the entire brain in FASD and their associations with facial dysmorphology. Controlling for brain size, subjects with FASD showed significantly thicker cortices than controls in several frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Analyses conducted within site further revealed prominent group differences in left inferior frontal cortex within all 3 sites. In addition, increased inferior frontal thickness was significantly correlated with reduced palpebral fissure length. Consistent with previous reports, findings of this study are supportive of regional increases in cortical thickness serving as a biomarker for disrupted brain development in FASD. Furthermore, the significant associations between thickness and dysmorphic measures suggest that the severity of brain anomalies may be reflected by that of the face. © 2011 The Author.

N2  - Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are validated biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure. Meconium FAEE testing can potentially be used as a screen by health-care professionals to identify neonates at-risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, thereby permitting diagnostic follow-up of these children and early intervention in those who develop disabilities. The purpose of this study was to assess whether women would willingly partake in a screening program of this nature. This was determined by launching a pilot screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure in a high-risk obstetric unit previously shown to have a high prevalence of FAEE-positive meconium via anonymous meconium testing. The program involved voluntary testing of meconium for FAEEs and long-term developmental follow-up of positive cases through an existing public health program. The participation rate in the screening program was significantly lower than when testing was conducted anonymously (78% vs. 95%, respectively; p < 0.05), and the positivity rate was 3% in contrast to 30% observed under anonymous conditions (p < 0.001). These low rates suggest that the majority of mothers who consumed alcohol in pregnancy refused to participate. We conclude that despite the potential benefits of such screening programs, maternal unwillingness to consent, likely due to fear, embarrassment, and guilt, may limit the effectiveness of meconium testing for population-based open screening, highlighting the need for public education and social marketing efforts for such programs to be of benefit. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - It has been elucidated that psychiatric disorders are associated with impairment of the brain neural network. Reduction in brain size and hypoplasia of the basal ganglia and corpus callosum have been reported in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). It is believed that the formation of the neural network is influenced by alcohol exposure during the fetal period. Additionally, it is well known that the functional expression of CNS consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure includes cognitive and attentional processes, as well as social behavioral problems. It has also been reported that abnormal 5-HT neuron development can be reversed by treatment with a 5-HT1A agonist in a prenatal alcohol exposure model. However, these treatments are prophylactic. Without early intervention, the consequences of FASD are permanent. Recently, emerging evidence suggest that many clinical symptoms observed in psychiatric disease are likely related to neural network disruptions including neurogenesis dysfunction. Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has been investigated in areas such as brain injury, stroke and neurodegenerative diseases and may be a way to reverse neurogenesis dysfunction. In the present work, we evaluated the usefulness of intravenous transplantation of NSCs in the FASD model rat focusing on the possibility of regenerative therapy, particularly regarding behavioral abnormalities, for FASD rats. Abnormal behaviors FASD model rats suggest that reduced social activity , and cognitive dysfunction are major symptoms in FASD patients. Intravenous NSC transplantation appeared to partially correct these behavioral abnormalities in FASD model rats. In the Amygdala areas intravenous NSC transplantation appears to have partially regaenerates expression of PSD95 in FASD model rats. The results suggest that intravenous NSC transplantation may be an advanced approach to recover neural network damage and CNS dysfunction in FASD and possibly other psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure results in major neurodevelopmental deficits. Cognitive impairments are generally most severe in children who meet diagnostic criteria for full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), but significant deficits are also observed in non-syndromal heavily-exposed (HE) children. However, the correlates of these effects in terms of disordered network interactions in the brain have never before been investigated. We used psycho-physiological interaction (Friston et al., 1997) to investigate differential effects of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; an important control region) on modulation of fronto-striatal-cerebellar regions during a simple working memory (WM) task (1-back). Methods: Data were collected in FAS/PFAS (n=17), HE (n=13) and Controls (n=17) groups (M: 8.9<age<10.6 yrs). The task alternated between 0-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), 1-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), and rest (20 s) epochs. Time series from the dACC (p<.05, effects of interest) were convolved with the psychological contrast of interest (1-back > 0-back) to investigate modulatory effects. Inter-group differences were evaluated in a second level analysis of variance with group as single factor. Results: See Figure. Conclusions: The increased modulation by the dACC of key brain regions mediating working memory suggests increased cognitive control-related inputs to sub-serve function in FAS/PFAS and HE children. These results constitute the first demonstration of the distal effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the disruption of functional interactions between key brain regions.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which manifests itself in the form of physiological defects, mental retardation and neurobehavioural deficits, the latter of which is rarely diagnosed. Since maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure and risk for FASD. While Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters (FAEEs) are current biomarkers of exposure, the introduction of a second biomarker that can be tested alongside FAEEs promises to greatly increase the sensitivity and specificity of analytical screens. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium, or first stool of life, of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Whether this detected EtG was formed by the maternal liver and crossed the placenta, by the fetal liver after ethanol crossed the placenta, or by the placenta itself remains unknown. Objectives: To determine if, and to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta, and to measure placental formation and degradation of EtG. Methods: Placentae from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario will be taken to the on-site perfusion laboratory. One mug/mL EtG will be added to the maternal reservoir and maternal and fetal samples will be taken over a 3 hour period to determine if and to what degree EtG is crossing the human placenta. EtG will be quantified using HS-SPME GC-MS. Placental metabolism of ethanol to EtG and EtG to ethanol will be investigated using placental microsomes. Kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km) will also be determined to help elucidate the role of the placenta in formation and degradation of EtG. Results: To date the perfusions are being carried out and the level of EtG in the perfusate will be determined using HS-SPME GC-MS with a limit of sensitivity of 1 ng/vial. Conclusions: We have developed a HS-SPME method for detecting EtG in maternal and fetal perfusate samples. This will allow us to accurately quantify the transfer of EtG across the human placenta.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase prevent cellular damage produced by free radicals. Our objective was to evaluate if prenatal alcohol exposure decreased the expression of antioxidant enzymes in the brain, liver, or placenta of fetal mice. STUDY DESIGN: Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with intraperitoneal injection of alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or saline (control). Fetuses were harvested on gestational day 18. Fetal brain, liver, and placenta were analyzed for mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase by real-time polymerase chain reaction, with 18S RNA used as reference. RESULTS: Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase expression was lower in fetal brains exposed to alcohol with no differences detected in the liver or placenta between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Maternal alcohol consumption causes a decrease in superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase expression in the fetal brain. This may explain the long-term neurologic findings in fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Alcoholism during pregnancy is one of the most common factors in western societies causing persisting congenital and multiple physical as well as neurological impairments. Finding the diagnosis at first sight puts medical professionals into a demanding situation. Therefore the objective of this study was to detect patients' developmental characteristics with the main focus on the necessity of the diagnosis itself. Patients: 125 young patients, whose diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was made at the Muenster University Hospital, were followed up. Methods: Biographic details such as living conditions, health, developmental problems and educational career were gathered using a structured interview. The diagnosis itself and the impact of this on the patients were also explored. Results: Patients displayed characteristics of a less mature trait of character. The majority were looked after by foster parents. High rates of social and developmental problems could be found. The diagnosis was identified as a protective factor, with significantly better outcomes for patients being diagnosed in early childhood. A diagnosis established later in life was particularly helpful for the families and caregivers. Feelings of failure and self-blame could be diminished. Conclusions: The early detection of affected children has to be improved as receiving the correct diagnosis, despite the persistent impairments, is of major benefit for both patients and their families. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart  New York.

N2  - Background: The physical features of fetal alcohol syndrome include smooth philtrum, thin vermillion border, short palpebral fissures, microcephaly, and growth deficiencies on weight and height. However, little is known about the specific quantities of alcohol exposure, pattern of drinking, timing of exposure, and magnitude of risk for each of these features. Methods: Using data on 992 subjects collected prospectively in California between 1978 and 2005, we examined the patterns and timing of alcohol exposure in relation to these features. Structural features were assessed by a dysmorphologist who performed a blinded physical examination of all infants. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0 to 6weeks postconception, 6 to 12weeks postconception, first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester. Results: Higher prenatal alcohol exposure in every pattern was significantly associated with the incidence of smooth philtrum but not with short palpebral fissures. The strongest associations were with timing of exposure in the second half of the first trimester (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.36 for average number of drinks per day; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.26 for maximum number of drinks in 1 episode). Similarly, thin vermillion border was most strongly associated with exposure in the second half of the first trimester. Findings with respect to timing of exposure were similar for microcephaly and reduced birth weight. However, reduced birth length was increased with exposure in any trimester. These associations were linear, and there was no evidence of a threshold. Conclusions: Reduced birth length and weight, microcephaly, smooth philtrum, and thin vermillion border are associated with specific gestational timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and are dose-related without evidence of a threshold. Women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol consumption from conception throughout pregnancy. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Individuals gestationally exposed to alcohol experience a multitude of sociobehavioral impairments, including deficits in adaptive behaviors such as social skills. Methods: The goal of this report is to critically review research on social skills deficits in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure, including individuals with and without fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Results: Social deficits are found in alcohol-exposed children, adults, and adolescents with and without a clinical presentation. These deficits tend to persist across the lifespan and may even worsen with age. Social deficits in this population appear to be independent of facial dysmorphology and IQ and are worse than can be predicted based on atypical behaviors alone. Abnormalities in neurobiology, executive function, sensory processing, and communication likely interact with contextual influences to produce the range of social deficits observed in FASD. Conclusions: Future investigations should strive to reconcile the relationship between social skills deficits in FASD and variables such as gender, age, cognitive profile, and structural and functional brain impairments to enable better characterization of the deficits observed in this population, which will enhance diagnosis and improve remediation. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - In part 1, we discussed the mechanism of alcohol exposure, dosimetry, and the teratogenic pathways of damage to the fetus. In part 2, we review the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and the developmental implications of prenatal alcohol exposure. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are associated with increased rates of mental retardation, seizure disorders, brain malformations, and premature mortality. The risk of comorbid disorders is increased among this population, which enhances phenotype severity and complexity of management. Recurrence rates are high and younger siblings tend to be more severely affected. Detection of prenatal alcohol use warrants substance abuse intervention, which can avoid exposure in subsequent pregnancies. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are common developmental disorders with a phenotype that is influenced by both age and development and require long-term management. Child neurologists are essential in the diagnosis and management of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - Individuals with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure can experience significant deficits in cognitive and psychosocial functioning and alterations in brain structure that persist into adulthood. In this report, data from 99 participants collected across three sites (Los Angeles and San Diego, California, and Cape Town, South Africa) were analyzed to examine relationships between brain structure, neurocognitive function, facial morphology, and maternal reports of quantities of alcohol consumption during the first trimester. Across study sites, we found highly significant volume reductions in the FASD group for all of the brain regions evaluated. After correcting for scan location, age, and total brain volume, these differences remained significant in some regions of the basal ganglia and diencephalon. In alcohol-exposed subjects, we found that smaller palpebral fissures were significantly associated with reduced volumes in the ventral diencephalon bilaterally, that greater dysmorphology of the philtrum predicted smaller volumes in basal ganglia and diencephalic structures, and that lower IQ scores were associated with both smaller basal ganglia volumes and greater facial dysmorphology. In subjects from South Africa, we found a significant negative correlation between intracranial volume and total number of drinks per week in the first trimester. These results corroborate previous reports that prenatal alcohol exposure is particularly toxic to basal ganglia and diencephalic structures. We extend previous findings by illustrating relationships between specific measures of facial dysmorphology and the volumes of particular subcortical structures, and for the first time show that continuous measures of maternal alcohol consumption during the first trimester relates to overall brain volume reduction. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Alcohol- induced behavioural problems in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder versus confounding behavioural problems
A1  - Malone M.
A1  - Koren G.
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is strongly associated with disruptive behaviour in childhood and antisocial behaviour later in life. There are numerous confounding risk factors in the lives of alcohol-abusing mothers that may contribute to the behaviour problems seen in their children, rather than direct brain injury by alcohol. In fact, many of these additional environmental and genetic risk factors for childhood behaviour problems co-occur with prenatal alcohol exposure and affect the same child, creating a confluence of risk. As a result, one cannot with any certainty attribute behaviour problems in an individual child to prenatal alcohol exposure. This has important clinical and legal implications. © 2012 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. All rights reserved.

N2  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium are validated biomarkers of heavy fetal alcohol exposure that may potentially be used clinically for identifying children at risk for alcohol-related disabilities. However, until now, FAEEs have been largely used anonymously in epidemiological studies, and by child protection authorities in need for verification of heavy alcohol use in pregnancy. Here we describe the first case of a neonate identified as part of a research study on a pilot neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure. The neonate's meconium tested high for FAEEs (52 nmol/g; positive cut-off >2 nmol/g), which prompted active follow-up of the infant's development, identifying early neurocognitive problems and allowing initiation of a remedial program. © 2012 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

T1  - Vitamin A, folate, and choline as a possible preventive intervention to fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Ballard M.S.
A1  - Sun M.
A1  - Ko J.
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - It is recognized that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Alcohol can trigger a pattern of neurodegeneration in rat brains similar to other known gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) specific agonists. However this does not seem to explain FAS entirely, as impoverished care-giving environments have been shown to increase the risk of FAS. Individuals living under the poverty level are at risk for micronutrient deficiencies due to insufficient intake. In particular, three nutrients commonly found to be deficient are folate, choline and vitamin A. There is evidence to suggest that ethanol alone may not explain the entire spectrum of anomalies seen in individuals with FAS. It is hypothesized that FAS may be caused more by the nutritional deficiencies that are exacerbated by alcohol than by direct alcoholic neurotoxicity.It is known that ethanol inhibits folate, choline, and vitamin A/retinoic acid metabolism at multiple steps. Additionally, mice exposed to ethanol demonstrated epigenetic changes, or variations in the methylation of DNA to control gene expression. Folate is important in the production of methyl groups, which are subsequently used to create and methylate DNA. Choline (which is metabolized to acetylcholine) is important in neurotransmission and neurodevelopment. It is also involved in an alternative pathway in the production of methyl groups. In fact a study by Thomas et al. in 2009 found that nutritional supplementation with choline in rats exposed to ethanol in utero almost completely mitigated the degenerative effects of ethanol on development and behaviour. Lastly, vitamin A and retinoic acid metabolism is associated with the regulation of one sixth of the entire proteome. Thus supplementation of folate, choline and vitamin A to mothers may mitigate the effects of the alcohol and reduce the severity or prevalence of FAS. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and because maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium, or first stool of life, of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta. METHODS: Placentae (n=4) from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario were taken to the on-site perfusion laboratory. After cannulation and establishment of dual circulation, 1 mug/mL EtG was added to the maternal reservoir and samples were taken throughout the 3 h experiment. Measurements of placental viability were oxygen transfer, pH, glucose consumption, hCG production, fetal reservoir volume, and fetal arterial inflow pressure. EtG was analyzed by GC-MS after solid phase extraction. RESULTS: After 3 h, a fetal-to-maternal ratio of 0.29 was reached, however EtG had not reached steady state between the 2 circulations as net maternal-to-fetal transfer was still occurring at the end of the experiment (Figure). Placental validation markers were within normal ranges for all perfusions. CONCLUSION: EtG appears to cross the human placenta and, hence, represent both maternal and fetal load of alcohol.

N2  - In the United States, approximately 80 000 women consume ethanol through all 3 trimesters of pregnancy each year. In this article, we review prevalence rates of prenatal alcohol exposure in the United States and discuss the mechanisms of prenatal alcohol exposure and placental-umbilical effects. Cigarette smoking and delayed prenatal care are often associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. In addition, increased risk for postnatal adversity is common, including maternal depression, foster care placement, and developmental delay. In part 2, we review prevalence rates and the diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and the implications for child neurologists. We discuss management strategies and the importance of a long-term management plan and anticipatory management to prevent the development of secondary disabilities in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Child neurologists play a key role in diagnosis and the development of appropriate intervention programs for affected children and their families. © SAGE Publications 2012.

N2  - Background: It has been estimated that approximately 12% of women consume alcohol at some time during their pregnancy, and as many as 5% of children born in the United States are impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The range of physical, behavioral, emotional, and social dysfunctions that are associated with PAE are collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Methods: Using a saccharin-sweetened ethanol solution, we developed a limited access model of PAE. C57BL/6J mice were provided access to a solution of either 10% (w/v) ethanol and 0.066% (w/v) saccharin or 0.066% (w/v) saccharin (control) for 4h/d. After establishing consistent drinking, mice were mated and continued drinking during gestation. Following parturition, solutions were decreased to 0% in a stepwise fashion over a period of 6days. Characterization of the model included measurements of maternal consumption patterns, blood ethanol levels, litter size, pup weight, maternal care, and the effects of PAE on fear-conditioned and spatial learning, and locomotor activity. Results: Mothers had mean daily ethanol intake of 7.17+/-0.17g ethanol/kg body weight per day, with average blood ethanol concentrations of 68.5+/-9.2mg/dl after 2hours of drinking and 88.3+/-11.5mg/dl after 4hours of drinking. Food and water consumption, maternal weight gain, litter size, pup weight, pup retrieval times, and time on nest did not differ between the alcohol-exposed and control animals. Compared with control offspring, mice that were exposed to ethanol prenatally displayed no difference in spontaneous locomotor activity but demonstrated learning deficits in 3 hippocampal-dependent tasks: delay fear conditioning, trace fear conditioning, and the delay nonmatch to place radial-arm maze task. Conclusions: These results indicate that this model appropriately mimics the human condition of PAE and will be a useful tool in studying the learning deficits seen in FASD. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Choline supplementation mitigates trace, but not delay, eyeblink conditioning deficits in rats exposed to alcohol during development

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Children exposed to alcohol prenatally suffer from a range of physical, neuropathological, and behavioral alterations, referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Both the cerebellum and hippocampus are affected by alcohol exposure during development, which may contribute to behavioral and cognitive deficits observed in children with FASD. Despite the known neuropathology associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, many pregnant women continue to drink (heavy drinkers, in particular), creating a need to identify effective treatments for their children who are adversely affected by alcohol. We previously reported that choline supplementation can mitigate alcohol's effects on cognitive development, specifically on tasks which depend on the functional integrity of the hippocampus. The present study examined whether choline supplementation could differentially mitigate alcohol's effects on trace eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC, a hippocampal-dependent task) and delay ECC (a cerebellar-dependent task). Long-Evans rats were exposed to 5.25 g/kg/day alcohol via gastric intubation from postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to late gestation in humans. A sham-intubated control group was included. From PD 10-30, subjects received subcutaneous injections of 100 mg/kg choline chloride or vehicle. Beginning on PD 32-34, subjects were trained on either delay or trace eyeblink conditioning. Performance of subjects exposed to alcohol was significantly impaired on both tasks, as indicated by significant reductions in percentage and amplitude of conditioned eyeblink responses, an effect that was attenuated by choline supplementation on the trace, but not delay conditioning task. Indeed, alcohol-exposed subjects treated with choline performed at control levels on the trace eyeblink conditioning task. There were no significant main or interactive effects of sex. These data indicate that choline supplementation can significantly reduce the severity of trace eyeblink conditioning deficits associated with early alcohol exposure, even when administered after the alcohol insult is complete. These findings have important implications for the treatment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Despite our increasing knowledge of the magnitude and breadth of abnormalities associated with FASD, little is known about the underlying biological mechanisms. We have established a C57BL/6J mouse model of developmental ethanol exposure that shows FASD-related behavioural phenotypes. In particular, we have shown that that ethanol treatment representing binge-like doses during synaptogenesis (third human trimester equivalent) results in spatial learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze. Using this model, we have also identified genome-wide changes in brain gene expression associated with neurodevelopmental alcohol exposure, both immediately following treatment (4 h postinjection) as well as long-term changes (postnatal day 60). Differentially- expressed genes were extracted (1.5-fold, FDR\0.05) and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology annotations for biological function, pathway, or interactions. Results revealed that the acute response to ethanol (4 h) included significant alterations in inflammatory, cell survival, and, interestingly, circadian rhythm-associated gene pathways. Long-term, persistent gene expression changes were more subtle but affected a number of pathways with wider biological roles. This included significant disruption of cadherin gene family cell adhesion molecules and neurotransmitter-associated pathways (glutamatergic, GABAergic, and serotonin systems were all identified). These data suggest that immediate cell survival mechanisms may induce long-term changes in critical cell-communication mechanisms, which may mediate the effects of ethanol exposure during synaptogenesis and its effects into early adulthood. These genes and pathways have relevance to FASD pathogenesis, and the identification of genome-wide changes in neurodevelopmental genetic programming may facilitate our understanding of the permanent behavioural and neurocellular consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce range of abnormalities and developmental defects to the developing fetus, referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is characterized by a particular pattern of facial anomalies, poor growth, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and defects in several organ systems including heart, kidney, vision, and hearing. FAS babies often have atrial and ventricular septal defects, and other structural cardiovascular defects. The mechanisms by which ethanol disrupts heart morphogenesis is not yet elucidated. We are using zebrafish embryos to investigate ethanol-induced cardiac defects and to dissect mechanisms underlying these defects. To determine heart developmental stage(s) most susceptible to ethanol exposure, we treated embryos in ethanol (0.6% and 0.9% v/v) during different critical stages of embryonic heart development. 1) Ethanol exposure during mesodermal cell migration to anterior lateral plate mesoderm region showed subtle abnormalities in chamber shape and size. 2) In contrast, ethanol treatment during cardiac specification until midline fusion of cardiomyocytes significantly delayed fusion of the bilateral population of myocardial cells (either developmental time or somite stage matched embryos) as revealed by cardiac myosin light chain 2 (cmlc2) in situ hydridization and by live imaging of tg(cmlc2: gfp) embryos. Treated embryos exhibited smaller heart chambers and frequent heart looping defects compared to control at 36 hours postfertilization (hpf). 3) Ethanol exposure during stages from heart cone rotation until chamber formation severely affected heart looping, chamber size, and morphology. At 32 hpf, ethanol induced embryos show narrower, more elongated, poorly looped heart tubes, as compared to normally looped and expanded heart chambers in control embryos. We hypothesized that ethanol competes with retinol and impairs RA synthesis, which interferes with cardiogenesis. In an attempt to rescue the ethanol-induced defects, embryos were co-treated with ethanol and 10-9 M retinoic acid (RA). Strikingly, supplementing all-trans-RA restored cardiomyocyte migration, fusion and rescued morphological defects. We are now examining molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced heart development defects. Understanding these mechanisms will significantly help us understand heart defects in FAS and might provide potential therapeutic targets for patients with this regrettably frequent birth defect.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, producing a spectrum of defects including facial abnormalities, sensory (visual and auditory) deficits, impaired fine motor skills and learning deficits including mental retardation. Our laboratory and others have shown that fetal alcohol syndrome can be modeled in zebrafish by ethanol exposure during early development. We hypothesized that embryonic ethanol exposure may alter the gene transcriptional profile that produces the FAS associated defects. To test that idea, we examined the ethanol induced gene expression changes in zebrafish using Affymetrix gene microarray analyses at early and mid-gastrulation (just prior to neurogenesis) stages. Expression of multiple genes involved in neurogenesis and patterning changed significantly after ethanol exposure, e.g., Delta, Hairy- and enhancer of split-related (Her) genes, Hoxb group of genes. Consistently, ethanol treated embryos showed defects in neural plate formation, neural patterning, neural differentiation, and cranial/lateral line ganglia formation, showing defects in a dose-dependent manner. However, the mechanisms by which ethanol affects normal neurogenesis is not yet clear. Ethanol induced changes in the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the transcription factor, neurogenin1 (ngn1), a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor that controls initial neurogenesis steps. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that ngn1 expression in the ethanol treated embryos was reduced at gastrulation stages and was increased during neurogenesis compared to that of the control embryos. We hypothesized that ethanol affects neural patterning by competing with retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, thus impairing retinoic acid synthesis. We observed that not only the phenotypic defects but many of the neural differentiation and patterning defects induced by ethanol exposure were rescued by a co-treatment with retinoic acid in the medium. Future work focuses on dissecting the molecular mechanisms behind ethanol defects and the retinoic acid rescue on neural development. Understanding neural development mechanisms disrupted by ethanol exposure will help identify potential therapeutic targets for neural defects in FAS.

T1  - Decreasing women's alcohol use during pregnancy
A1  - Osterman R.L.
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - A woman's use of alcohol during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), a combination of physical, neurological, and cognitive/behavioral abnormalities that has serious, lifelong ramifications for the child. Still pregnant women continue to consume alcohol with recently reported prevalence estimates of FASD on the increase. Intervention studies have been successful in decreasing prenatal alcohol use in alcohol dependent and nondependent women. Yet translation of these interventions into clinical practice is essential to prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancies. This article provides information to assist practitioners in the provision of evidence-based interventions that decrease prenatal alcohol use, thereby, decreasing future incidence of FASD.

N2  - Background: HIV-positive pregnant women who drink put their children at risk of both HIV and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) has the highest prevalence of HIV in South Africa, but has not before been considered an area of high alcohol consumption among women. This paper analyzes a large sample of HIV+ pregnant women in KZN to examine alcohol consumption in that population. Methods: Data came from assessments of women enrolled in Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission programs at 8 clinics in KZN. Descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were used to examine the prevalence and correlates of alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Results: Of 1201 women assessed, 18% reported drinking during pregnancy, and 67% of drinkers usually binged when drinking (had 3+ drinks in one sitting). Over one-third of drinkers binged twice a month or more. Women living in urban and peri-urban locations were more likely to drink, as were those with indicators of higher economic status and greater social engagement. Married women were less likely to drink, while women who had poorer mental health, used tobacco, or had a greater history of sexual risk-taking were more likely to drink. Conclusion: Health care workers in KZN should be aware that pregnant women who drink are likely to do so at a level that is dangerous for their babies. Some factors associated with drinking indicate social/environmental influences that need to be counteracted by greater dissemination of information about the dangers of drinking, and greater support for abstinence or moderation. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) represent a significant public health problem. The influence of the male partner's alcohol consumption patterns and the quality of the partner's intimate relationship might be important factors to consider in the design of successful FASD prevention programs. Method: As part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, 166 pregnant women in two regions in Ukraine participated in an in-person interview at an average gestational age of 18-19 weeks. Subjects were classified cross-sectionally as abstainers/light drinkers (n = 80), defined as low or no consumption of alcohol in the periconceptional period and none in the most recent 2 weeks of pregnancy; discontinuers (n = 43), defined as moderate to heavy alcohol use in the periconceptional period but none during the most recent 2 weeks of pregnancy; or continuing drinkers (n = 43), defined as continued moderate to heavy alcohol use within the most recent 2 weeks of pregnancy. Women also reported on their partner's drinking behavior and on the quality of their intimate relation- ship. Results: Heavy paternal drinking was significantly associated with both continuing maternal drinking in the most recent 2 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 34.1; 95% CI [5.9, 195.8]) and being a risky drinker only around conception (adjusted OR = 27.0; 95% CI [5.0, 147.7]). In addition, women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy had lower mean scores for satisfaction with partners' relationship and ability to discuss problems (p <.05) compared with light drinkers/abstainers. Conclusions: This study suggests that development of partner-based interventions, as opposed to those solely focused on maternal drinking, might be warranted as a strategy to prevent FASD.

N2  - Objective: South Africa has among the highest reported rates of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) globally. Primary prevention targeting women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies could substantially reduce the incidence of FAS. We evaluated the effectiveness of a short training intervention to improve service providers' screening, identification, and management of women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Method: Training to screen and counsel women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies was offered to 86 service providers (95% of whom were female) in two municipalities in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Effectiveness was evaluated through a before-after study of service providers' knowledge and confidence levels and a comparison of service providers' practices (assessed indirectly via service user exit interviews) at intervention and control clinics. Results: The proportion of service providers indicating that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the fetus increased after training (23% vs. 67%; p< 001). After training, providers expressed significantly more confidence for four skills indicators related to the identification and management of women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Female clients at intervention clinics were more likely than those at the control clinics to receive alcohol advice (odds ratio [OR] = 2.13, 95% CI [1.27, 3.53]), counseling (OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.05, 1.56]), and an offer of family planning (OR= 1.1, 95% CI [1.06, 2.10]) after the training. Time x Group interaction variable analysis in multiple logistic regression modeling confirmed these effects as related to training. Conclusions: A short training course based on brief motivational interviewing principles appears to be effective in building service provider capacity to better prevent and manage women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A native American journey to prevention
A1  - Beckett C.D.
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, the most common preventable cause for mental retardation, is the result of prenatal alcohol exposure. There is no safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy. Native Americans have a higher risk of alcohol abuse than the general US population. The fetal alcohol spectrum disorders prevalence rates for Native Americans range from 1.0 to 8.97 per 1000 births. Nurses and health care providers working in collaboration with tribal fetal alcohol spectrum disorders prevention specialists can greatly, and positively, impact the physical and mental health and well-being of children in Native American communities.

T1  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy: evidence from Canadian Community Health Survey 2007/2008

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy may cause many health problems for the child, one of which is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Since FASD is incurable, actions meant to prevent the occurrence of the disability by targeting drinking women become more important. Epidemiological data on drinking among pregnant women, including prevalence and determinants/risk factors, is essential for designing and evaluating prevention programs. To estimate the prevalence of drinking alcohol during pregnancy and examine the determinants of this behaviour. Using the 2007/8 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) data, we estimated the weighted prevalence of women who drank alcohol during their last pregnancy by provinces. We used a weighted logistic regression to examine associations between drinking patterns, substance abuse behaviours, health-related and socio-demographic characteristics of the women, and the outcome variable. There were two main findings of this study. One was that the 2007/8 prevalence of drinking alcohol during pregnancy in ON, BC, and Canada was estimated at 5.4%, 7.2%, and 5.8%, respectively. The other was that the use of general practitioners (GP) or family physicians (FP) associated with a decreased risk of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. The results suggest that interventions that involve GP or FP and that increase the use of GP or FP by pregnant women can be effective in reducing drinking alcohol during pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Preventing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) depends on obstetricians detecting maternal risk drinking during antenatal care. ACOG and NIAAA recommend using the T-ACE, an economical/ sensitive screen. We have reported that a more stringent T-ACE total score cut-point (3 vs. 2) increased specificity in identifying maternal risk drinking & alcohol-related neurobehavioral dysfunction in children (Chiodo et al, 2010). Our aim was to assess how increasing the T-ACE cut-point could increase efficiency of clinical practice. STUDY DESIGN: Self-reported peri-conceptional & in-pregnancy drinking were assessed with semi-structured interviews and alcohol screens in a prospective sub-sample of 239 African-American mothers given an in-pregnancy T-ACE. The original T-ACE risk criterion (total score of 2) and the revised T-ACER3 criterion with a total score of 3 were analyzed. ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons compared preand in-pregnancy alcohol consumption quantity and frequency measures by risk category. Categories were: 1) No Risk Group (NRG) = no risk for pregnancy alcohol use based on both T-ACE and T-ACER3 criteria (n=140); 2) At Risk Group (ARG) based on both T-ACE and T-ACER3 criteria (n=28); and 3) Change Risk Group (CRG) identified as at-risk with the original T-ACE criterion but not at-risk using the revised T-ACER3 criterion (n=71). RESULTS: The 71 women (30%) in the Change Risk Group (CRG) had patterns of alcohol use similar to the no risk group (NRG). As predicted, post-hoc analysis revealed that the at-risk group (ARG) had significantly more alcohol use both prior to and during pregnancy than either the NRG or CRG groups. CONCLUSION: The results provide further evidence that adjusting the T-ACE total score cut-point to 3 in the T-ACER3 is clinically appropriate. Using the T-ACER3 criteria, only 12% of women would require intervention, compared with 41% for T-ACE. Increasing the total T-ACE score criterion from 2 to 3 results in fewer "false positives," allowing a more intensive targeted clinical response with pregnant women correctly identified by the T-ACER3 as drinking at fetal risk levels.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreases the fetal brain mRNA expression of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD). Our OBJECTIVE was to elucidate the role of oxidant/antioxidant mechanisms in the etiology of FAS by determining whether decrease in SODmRNAexpression is associated with reduced protein expression and/or enzymatic activity. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or vehicle. Fetuses were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18) and their brain processed for protein analysis and enzymatic activity. Western Blots were performed assessing protein expression of SOD normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). SOD activity was measured using an assay based on inhibition of XTT reduction by superoxide. The rate of superoxide dismutation was calculated by the reciprocal rate of formazan formation as measured calorimetrically at an absorbance of 490nm over 30 minutes. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test (significance: p<0.05). RESULTS: Fetal alcohol exposure caused a significant increase in protein expression (0.63 vs 0.27 ratio protein/GAPDH; p=0.02) and no difference in enzymatic activity of SOD (31.9 vs. 32.3 arbitrary units; p>0.10) at E18 when compared to vehicle treated controls. CONCLUSION: The previously reported decrease in fetal brain SOD mRNA expression in FAS is not associated with a decrease in protein expression, nor with altered SOD activity. In fetuses exposed to alcohol, increased SOD protein expression is not accompanied by increased activity of SOD. These findings suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to the preservation of SOD protein expression and activity in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreases antioxidant enzymes in the fetal brain in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Exposure to alcohol is known to decrease expression of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) a serine threonine kinase that regulates glycogen synthesis through phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase. In addition to regulation of glycogen, GSK-3beta is positively correlated with expression of nuclear transcription factors, NF-kappa beta and Nrf2, which are inactive in the cytosol and active within nucleus. Our objective was to evaluate if the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on fetal brain antioxidants can be explained by an effect on GSK-3beta, NF-kappa beta and Nrf2. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or vehicle. Fetuses were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18), and the brain prepared for protein analysis. Western Blots were performed assessing the protein expression of GSK-3beta and cytosolic and nuclear expression ofNF-kappa beta and Nrf2 normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test (significance: p<0.05). RESULTS: GSK-3beta protein levels were significantly lower (0.73 vs 1.06 ratio protein/GAPDH; p=0.01) and cytosolic Nrf2 protein levels were significantly higher (0.72 vs 0.43 ratio protein/GAPDH; p=0.01) in the brain of pups exposed to alcohol compared with control. There was no significant difference in cytosolic expression of NF-kappa beta or nuclear expression of NF-kappa beta and Nrf2 between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In utero exposure to alcohol reduces GSK-3 and increases cytosolic Nrf2 protein levels in the fetal brain. These findings provide a mechanism for the decrease in antioxidants in the brain of FAS offspring, and a potential target for preventive strategies.

N2  - Aims: Prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is remarkably high in several provinces of South Africa; yet population-level knowledge of the harms of maternal drinking remains low. In two heavily affected areas, we assessed effectiveness of interventions to heighten awareness of these harms and to alter social norms about drinking in pregnancy. Methods: FASD prevalence, maternal knowledge and drinking behaviours were investigated in two Northern Cape Province towns, before and after interventions which included highlighting FASD using local media and health promotion talks at health facilities. Independently, two dysmorphologists and a neuropsychometrist examined children at 9 and 18 months. Results: Pre-intervention maternal knowledge of alcohol harms was low and FASD prevalence 8.9% (72/809). Interventions reached high coverage and knowledge levels increased substantially. FASD prevalence was 5.7% post-intervention (43/751; P=0.02); 0.73 lower odds, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity (95% confidence interval=0.58-0.90). No change was detected in more severe FASD forms, but in the whole population, median dysmorphology scores reduced from 4 [inter-quartile range (IQR)=2-7] to 3 (IQR=1-6; P=0.002). Conclusion: This, the first prevention study using FASD outcomes, suggests that universal prevention might reduce FASD by ~30% and have population-level effects. This supports intensifying universal interventions where knowledge of harms of maternal drinking is low. These efforts need to be accompanied by alcohol-dependence treatment to lower more severe FASD forms. © The Author 2011.

N2  - Conceptualizations of risks related to women's alcohol use during pregnancy, and the attendant response to preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), are examined in six countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Uganda, Uruguay, and China. Considerable differences were found in how risks were conceptualized across countries and in contextual factors that influence research, prevention, and intervention efforts. Differences in conceptualizations were also apparent within countries. Differences also existed in the degree to which the issue of drinking during pregnancy has been minimized or amplified and in whether and how responses are linked to treatment or other public health interventions.

N2  - An alcohol-server training program to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome was developed, implemented, and evaluated in a comparison study of public drinking establishments in New Mexico and Oregon. The management and serving staffs of 148 establishments licensed for on-premise alcohol sales in the two states studied were trained to discourage alcohol consumption by pregnant customers. Pre- and post-tests of server responses to pregnant-appearing "pseudo-patron" actors ordering alcohol in experimental (n = 148) and comparison (n = 183) establishments were a key method of evaluating the efficacy of this intervention. Within-group chi-square analyses compared rates of service refusal at baseline with 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up points for both the trained (experimental) and the comparison establishments. No differences were found between experimental and comparison establishments at baseline at either site, but significant differences were found for New Mexico at each posttraining measurement point. In Oregon, the refusal rate at baseline increased from 1.5% at baseline to 8.3% at 1 month, which only approached significance. In New Mexico, at baseline the refusal rate was 8.6%, and it rose to 39.2% at 6 months (p < .0001, odds ratio = 6.83) and remained high at 28.2% at 12 months (p < .001, odds ratio = 4.15). No similarly significant gains were recorded at control establishments. Supplemental responsible beverage service training for alcohol servers to aid in the prevention of fetal alcohol exposure can be effective in reducing the serving of alcohol to visibly pregnant women, with robust effects continuing over the subsequent year in the New Mexico establishments.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a syndrome that results from prenatal alcohol exposure and is defined by significant neurobehavioral impairments. Sleep disruption has been recognized as a clinically important symptom of FASD that has multiple negative effects on the child's health, ability to function adaptively, as well as on family and caregivers. However, few studies have addressed and characterized the sleep problems in this population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize sleep in FASD and describe the impact of sensory processing difficulties on sleep patterns in children with FASD. METHODS: Children with FASD were compared with age-matched typically developing children between 3 and 6 years of age. Sleep was assessed using actigraphy, a sleep log, and the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire. The Sensory Profile, completed by caregivers, was used to evaluate the child's sensory processing abilities. Overall differences in sensory processing were correlated with actigraphic parameters measured in alcohol exposed and control groups. RESULTS: Data show that children with FASD have significantly more sleep disturbances than typically developing children, including increased bedtime resistance, shortened sleep duration, increased sleep anxiety, and increased night awakenings and parasomnias. Actigraphy reveals a significant difference between groups for sleep onset latency. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that sensory processing deficits are widespread in children with FASD and that these deficits are associated with multiple sleep problems. Children with FASD should be screened for sleep-related disorders and would benefit from occupational therapy for sensory-based treatment aimed at sleep regulation and consolidation. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - When fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was initially described, diagnosis was based upon physical parameters including facial anomalies and growth retardation, with evidence of developmental delay or mental deficiency. Forty years of research has shown that FAS lies towards the extreme end of what are now termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The most profound effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are on the developing brain and the cognitive and behavioral effects that ensue. Alcohol exposure affects brain development via numerous pathways at all stages from neurogenesis to myelination. For example, the same processes that give rise to the facial characteristics of FAS also cause abnormal brain development. Behaviors as diverse as executive functioning to motor control are affected. This special issue of Neuropsychology Review addresses these changes in brain and behavior highlighting the relationship between the two. A diagnostic goal is to recognize FAS as a disorder of brain rather than one of physical characteristics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

T1  - Functional neuroimaging in the examination of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Coles C.D.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Functional neuroimaging offers the opportunity to understand the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the activities of the brain as well as providing a window into the relationship between neural activation and the behavioral outcomes that have been described in affected individuals. Several different methodologies have been used to examine the neurophysiological signal changes associated with different brain functions in prenatally exposed individuals and those diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These include electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These studies demonstrate that it is feasible to use these technologies with this clinical population and that the damage to the central nervous system associated with prenatal alcohol exposure has widespread functional implications; however, currently, the literature in these areas is limited and unsystematic. Functional MRI with this clinical population has just begun to explore the implications of prenatal alcohol exposure with the first paper published in 2005. Other methodologies are similarly limited in scope. Nonetheless, these functional neuroimaging studies suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure, or a diagnosis of FAS, may lead to restrictions in neural efficiency or a global decrement in processing resources. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - The characteristic facial features of the more severe end of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) include smooth philtrum, thin vermillion of the upper lip, and short palpebral fissures. A systematic evaluation of a comprehensive list of minor structural defects in association with varying patterns of prenatal exposure to alcohol has not been performed. We examined the patterns and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure to minor structural malformations occurring in at least 5% of the sample. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0-6 weeks post-conception, 6-12 weeks post-conception, first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester. Naevus flammeus neonatorum is significantly associated with various patterns of drinking during the second half of the first trimester (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04, 1.24 for average number of drinks per day; RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.07 for number of binge episodes; RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01, 1.15 for maximum number of drinks in one episode) and similar for number of binge episodes in all categories of timing of exposure and in the second trimester for average number of drinks per day. Other minor malformations occurring in at least 5% of the sample were not found to be significantly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Expected minor malformations were not found to be significantly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Naevus flammeus neonatorum appears to be part of the spectrum of features associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a wide range of neurocognitive effects. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC), which involves temporal pairing of a conditioned with an unconditioned stimulus, has been shown to be a potential biomarker of fetal alcohol exposure. A growing body of evidence suggests that white matter may be a specific target of alcohol teratogenesis, and the neural circuitry underlying EBC is known to involve the cerebellar peduncles. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that has proven useful for assessing central nervous system white matter integrity. This study used DTI to examine the degree to which the fetal alcohol-related deficit in EBC may be mediated by structural impairment in the cerebellar peduncles. Methods: Thirteen children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and 12 matched controls were scanned using DTI and structural MRI sequences. The DTI data were processed using a voxelwise technique, and the structural data were used for volumetric analyses. Prenatal alcohol exposure group and EBC performance were examined in relation to brain volumes and outputs from the DTI analysis. Results: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and perpendicular diffusivity group differences between alcohol-exposed and nonexposed children were identified in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. Alcohol exposure correlated with lower FA and greater perpendicular diffusivity in this region, and these correlations remained significant even after controlling for total brain and cerebellar volumes. Conversely, trace conditioning performance was related to higher FA and lower perpendicular diffusivity in the left middle peduncle. The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on trace conditioning was partially mediated by lower FA in this region. Conclusions: This study extends recent findings that have used DTI to reveal microstructural deficits in white matter in children with FASD. This is the first DTI study to demonstrate mediation of a fetal alcohol-related effect on neuropsychological function by deficits in white matter integrity.

N2  - New patterns of alcohol drinking are leading to a significant increase in alcohol damage. Epidemiological data show lowering age of first alcohol use that in Italy is close to 12 ys, and an increasing number of female drinkers. The latest evidence indicates a higher risk for female pathologies and for alcohol drinking during pregnancy with consequent foetal alcohol exposure. In the western countries, prenatal alcohol exposure is the main preventable cause of mental retardation in children. Alcohol produces negative effects on foetal development globally defined FASD (Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders) and the major consequence is FAS (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). Recent epidemiological studies show that FAS and FASD are present in Italy and are surely underestimated. Some aspects of alcohol-related problems in paediatric age are discussed in the present article together with recent perspectives in the study on new biomarkers. However, prevention is the mainstay where paediatricians may have a pivotal role in recognizing and treating alcohol disease in the newborn and in the early adolescent promptly.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is common with about 80,000 women continuing to drink through all three trimesters of pregnancy each year. PAE is also associated with postnatal adversities, including abuse and neglect, which increase risk for foster care placement. Each day 700 children enter the foster care system. A diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) also increases the risk for foster care placement. Among children diagnosed with FASD 70% are or have been in foster care. FASD prevalence rates are increased 10- to 15-fold in foster care systems. Foster care is an important opportunity to detect FASD and provide services to infants and children with FASD. FASD is the third most common identifiable cause of mental retardation in the United States. We describe a court-team-based model of care developed to improve management of children with PAE or FASD entering foster care. The programmatic objectives include: enhancing detection of PAE; screening for FASD; increased consideration of FASD as a potential issue in treatment planning with foster parents; improved entry into treatment; and increased surveillance for parents with an FASD. © 2011 by Federal Legal Publications, Inc.

T1  - The criminal justice system's disparate treatment of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in cases involving sexual activity
A1  - Mcmurtrie J.
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are treated differently by the criminal justice system in sex offense prosecutions, depending upon whether they are categorized as victims or perpetrators. The primary and secondary disabilities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure are often taken into consideration when assessing the capacity of a victim to consent to sexual activity, but generally not considered in determining whether a defendant had the mens rea to engage in criminal sexual conduct. This article traces the historical underpinnings of the mens rea requirement in criminal law and discusses its elimination in most prosecutions for statutory rape. The article recommends that additional research be conducted to determine the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on an individual's capacity to consent to sexual activity. It suggests that fundamental principles of culpability require an examination of how FASD impacts an individual's capacity to engage in meaningful, responsible, decision making about sexual activity before criminal sanctions are imposed. © 2011 by Federal Legal Publications, Inc.

T1  - Childhood behavioural and developmental disorders - association with maternal alcohol consumption in Cape Town, South Africa

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Current maternal alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, is strongly associated with childhood behavioural and/or developmental disorders (BDDs) in a population attending tertiary hospital ambulatory services. BDDs were also associated with maternal alcohol use 6 months before pregnancy. An association with BDDs could not be conclusively demonstrated for drinking during pregnancy, but this may have been influenced by underreporting and reduced study power due to misclassification of exposure. We cannot rule out the a priori suspicion that some mild BDDs in children in the Western Cape could be undiagnosed fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Nonetheless, the study highlighted the important impact of current maternal alcohol use on behaviour and development of children. Future research on the impact of maternal alcohol use on childhood development should include examination of environmental and social factors contributing to this increased risk. Upstream interventions aimed at reducing alcohol-related harms may also contribute to reducing the burden of BDDs.

N2  - The knowledge of the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy isn't indeed a new issue, but the recent evidences of ethyl-glucuronide and ethyl-sulfate in meconium as novel biomarkers of prenatal ethanol exposure open new perspectives for the early diagnosis of the alcohol-related birth defects. This is crucial for a better developmental outcome of the affected patients and for preventing additional cases in at risk families. The fetal alcohol syndrome is not a single entity but represents the most severe form of a spectrum of disorders, including distinctive craniofacial alterations, stunted growth and behavioral abnormalities, caused by complex gene-environment interactions. FAS must always be a diagnosis of exclusion and have to be differentiated from many conditions caused by other embryotoxin agents and genetic syndromes that share some phenotypic features. Even if the first trimester is considered the most vulnerable period, nowadays is known that a fetal damage might occur throughout all gestation. Since ethanol consumption is constantly increasing among young women, a substantial amount of work has to be made to implement the knowledge on alcohol fetal effects among women of childbearing age; moreover, awareness and training among professionals in the health care system might play a critical role in the early diagnosis of these serious conditions. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Background. High numbers of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) have been described as having mental health problems. Aims.This article summarizes research about mental health problems in FASD and considers related developmental and environmental issues. Method. A computer-based literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Academic Search Complete, and Education Resources Information Centre for articles addressing the prevalence and types of mental health issues in individuals affected by FASD. Results. High rates of mental disorders within the FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) population were found to be consistently reported for both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Moreover, problems that emerge in childhood may reflect a convergence of genetic, environmental, and neurophysiological factors that persist into adulthood. Conclusions. Researchers are beginning to document the impacts of PAE on later mental health development. Further longitudinal study is needed to determine whether there is an increasing severity of mental health deficits and consequences with age, and whether any such changes reflect increasingly deteriorating environmental factors or brain-based factors. Additionally, research is needed to design interventions to better address the unique mental health needs of this population. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Ethanol-induced neuro-developmental abnormalities are associated with impaired insulin and IGF signaling, and increased oxidative stress in CNS neurons. We examined the roles of ethanol and its principal toxic metabolite, acetaldehyde, as mediators of impaired insulin/IGF signaling and oxidative injury in immature cerebellar neurons. Cultures were exposed to 3.5mM acetaldehyde or 50mM ethanol +/- 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), an inhibitor of ethanol metabolism, and viability, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and insulin responsiveness were measured 48 hours later. Acetaldehyde or ethanol increased neuronal death and levels of 8-OHdG and 4-HNE, and reduced mitochondrial function. Ethanol inhibited insulin responsiveness, whereas acetaldehyde did not. 4-MP abated ethanol-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, but failed to restore insulin responsiveness. Furthermore, alcohol and aldehyde metabolizing enzyme genes were inhibited by prenatal ethanol exposure; this effect was mediated by acetaldehyde and not ethanol + 4MP. These findings suggest that brain insulin resistance in prenatal alcohol exposure is caused by direct effects of ethanol, whereas oxidative stress induced neuronal injury is likely mediated by ethanol and its toxic metabolites. Moreover, the adverse effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on brain development may be exacerbated by down-regulation of genes needed for metabolism and detoxification of alcohol in the brain.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) occurs in children of mothers consuming alcohol during pregnancy. The recent statement of NOFAS (National Organization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) and FASD Center of Excellence in Washington DC of April 15th, 2004 has the following wording: "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a broad term describing a wide range of developmental outcomes among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure. The outcomes may include physical, mental, cognitive and behavioural anomalies; and they may persist across the lifespan. The term FASD is not intended for use as a clinical diagnosis". As a result of alcohol intoxication during the prenatal development the fetus is damaged at the cellular level, which results in a malformation of the central nervous system and internal organs. The most dangerous consequence of the prenatal alcohol damage is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Developmental disorders of children with FASD occur in different areas. These include: abnormal cognitive development (problems with memory, hyper-activity, planning, anticipation, skills learning), problems with emotions, especially in social situations (withdrawal or aggression, a tendency to steal and lie, avoidance of responsibility, credulity, over-confidence and lack of reflection). Currently used diagnostic criteria are still based on the triad of the following clinical symptoms: 1. characteristic facial features; 1. growth deficiency; 1. central nervous system abnormalities. The outcomes of the teratogenic (toxic for fetus) impact of alcohol exposure depend on the following: * Amount of alcohol (Note! Even a very small amount of alcohol may in certain circumstances be dangerous). * Phase of pregnancy - in each trimester some specific damage typical for a given moment of fetus development may take place. In the first trimester alcohol exposure can lead to growth retardation and development of dysmorphia, in the second and third trimester the central nervous system is mostly vulnerable and there is a disturbed neurotransmitters production. * Mother's general health condition (nutritional status, genetic predisposition, immune system). Children of drinking mothers who did not present all the symptoms of damage (dysmorphia) were initially described as the FAE children (fetal alcohol effects). The aim of this study is to analyse the clinical picture of depression on the basis of the case of a 12-year-old boy. The authors describe the symptoms presented by him and give understanding of the patient in the individual context, as well as in relationship with his mother, and discuss his drawing. They propose a psychotherapy treatment.

N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to ethanol can produce a complex set of effects on fetal development, which is denominated fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Early detection of ethanol exposure can allow the prevention of some relevant adverse effects associated to FASD. Objectives: The aim of this work was to review the main toxic effects of ethanol on the neonate and the available biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: A bibliographic search was performed in PubMed employing the terms "effects maternal ethanol exposure" and "biomarkers ethanol prenatal exposure" and cross references. Results: Many adverse effects on fetal development were described, especially deficits in the central nervous system. The biomarkers of ethanol exposure more widely described were fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS), being meconium and hair the most common biological matrices for laboratorial evaluation. Discussion: The early detection of alcohol exposure in intra-uterine life is useful to prevent the secondary effects of FASD through pharmacologic and educational intervention in affected children.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is thought to be the most prevalent nongenetic cause of a wide range of neurodevelopmental deficits. Insufficient thyroid hormone levels are one mechanism that hampers development of the alcohol-exposed brain, and we hypothesized that altered dosage of the imprinted thyroid hormone-inactivating gene deiodinase-III (Dio3) is responsible. To follow parent-of-origin allelic expression of Dio3 in the fetal and adult offspring of alcohol-consuming and control dams, we reciprocally crossed 2 polymorphic rat strains. In the frontal cortex, prenatal alcohol exposure altered imprinting patterns and total expression of Dio3 in the fetus and produced a permanent hypothyroid milieu in the adult. In the hippocampus, alcohol affected the paternal and total expression of Dio3 in the fetus and in the adult male, where thyroid hormone levels were concomitantly increased. Hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits were identified exclusively in males, suggesting they are dependent on aberrant allelic Dio3 expression. None of these effects were observed in offspring of the reciprocal cross. Thus, genetic background and sex modify vulnerability to prenatal alcohol via brain region-specific expression of Dio3. This finding implies that phenotypic heterogeneity in human fetal alcohol spectrum disorder can be linked to genetic vulnerability in affected brain regions. © FASEB.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a range of disabilities caused by gestational exposure of the fetus to alcohol. Alcohol consumption in Israel has increased dramatically in the last decades. Our previous study revealed limited knowledge among Israeli medical professionals of the risks and potential long-term effects of FASD. Objectives: To evaluate the awareness and knowledge of women regarding the current recommendations on alcohol consumption during pregnancy, evaluate how many of the women received information regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy from medical professionals, and their personal drinking habits during pregnancy. Methods: A cross-sectional sample of new mothers in 3 large hospitals in Israel were asked to complete an ad hoc questionnaire on aspects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results: A total of 3815 women of mean age 30.4 years participated in the study; 82% were Jewish. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported by 14.1%, including more than 17% of the Jewish women, 11.1% of the Christian women, and none of the Muslim women. Rates were higher among nonsecular and younger women and first-time mothers. 71.6% of the sample claimed that women should not drink alcohol at all during pregnancy, and 21.4% thought that it was permissible if limited to 2 drinks per week. Seventy-five percent had received no formal information from medical professionals regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Conclusions: Alcohol consumption is frequent among pregnant women in Israel, especially young secular Jewish women with first pregnancies. Improved educational programs on the dangers of FASD are needed for both professionals and the general public. © 2011 Canadian Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. All rights reserved.

T1  - Molecular and behavioral aspects of the actions of alcohol on the adult and developing brain

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The brain is one of the major target organs of alcohol actions. Alcohol abuse can lead to alterations in brain structure and functions and, in some cases, to neurodegeneration. Cognitive deficits and alcohol dependence are highly damaging consequences of alcohol abuse. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to alcohol, and that drinking during gestation can lead to a range of physical, learning and behavioral defects (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders), with the most dramatic presentation corresponding to fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent findings also indicate that adolescence is a stage of brain maturation and that heavy drinking at this stage can have a negative impact on brain structure and functions causing important short-and long-term cognitive and behavioral consequences. The effects of alcohol on the brain are not uniform; some brain areas or cell populations are more vulnerable than others. The prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, the white matter and glial cells are particularly susceptible to the effects of ethanol. The molecular actions of alcohol on the brain are complex and involve numerous mechanisms and signaling pathways. Some of the mechanisms involved are common for the adult brain and for the developing brain, while others depend on the developmental stage. During brain ontogeny, alcohol causes irreversible alterations to the brain structure. It also impairs several molecular, neurochemical and cellular events taking place during normal brain development, including alterations in both gene expression regulation and the molecules involved in cella"cell interactions, interference with the mitogenic and growth factor response, enhancement of free radical formation and derangements of glial cell functions. However, in both adult and adolescent brains, alcohol damages specific brain areas through mechanisms involving excitotoxicity, free radical formation and neuroinflammatory damage resulting from activation of the innate immune system mediated by TLR4 receptors. Alcohol also acts on specific membrane proteins, such as neurotransmitter receptors (e.g. NMDA, GABA-A), ion channels (e.g. L-type Ca2+ channels, GIRKs), and signaling pathways (e.g. PKA and PKC signaling). These effects might underlie the wide variety of behavioral effects induced by ethanol drinking. The neuroadaptive changes affecting neurotransmission systems which are more sensitive to the acute effects of alcohol occur after long-term alcohol consumption. Alcohol-induced maladaptations in the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, abnormal plastic changes in the reward-related brain areas and genetic and epigenetic factors may all contribute to alcohol reinforcement and alcohol addiction. This manuscript reviews the mechanisms by which ethanol impacts the adult and the developing brain, and causes both neural impairments and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. The identification and the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ethanol toxicity might contribute to the development of treatments and/or therapeutic agents that could reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of alcohol on the brain. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a range of disabilities caused by gestational exposure of the fetus to alcohol. Alcohol consumption in Israel has increased dramatically in the last decades. Our previous study revealed limited knowledge among Israeli medical professionals of the risks and potential long-term effects of FASD. Objectives To evaluate the awareness and knowledge of women regarding the current recommendations on alcohol consumption during pregnancy, evaluate how many of the women received information regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy from medical professionals, and their personal drinking habits during pregnancy. Methods A cross-sectional sample of new mothers in 3 large hospitals in Israel were asked to complete an ad hoc questionnaire on aspects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results A total of 3815 women of mean age 30.4 years participated in the study; 82% were Jewish. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported by 14.1%, including more than 17% of the Jewish women, 11.1% of the Christian women, and none of the Muslim women. Rates were higher among nonsecular and younger women and first-time mothers. 71.6% of the sample claimed that women should not drink alcohol at all during pregnancy, and 21.4% thought that it was permissible if limited to 2 drinks per week. Seventy-five percent had received no formal information from medical professionals regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Conclusions Alcohol consumption is frequent among pregnant women in Israel, especially young secular Jewish women with first pregnancies. Improved educational programs on the dangers of FASD are needed for both professionals and the general public. ©2011 Canadian Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics All rights reserved.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is a major, preventable cause of behavioral and cognitive deficits in children. Despite extensive research, a unique neurobehavioral profile for children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure remains elusive. A fundamental question that must be addressed is how genetic and environmental factors interact with gestational alcohol exposure to produce neurobehavioral and neurobiological deficits in children. The core objectives of the NeuroDevNet team in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is to create an integrated research program of basic and clinical investigations that will (1) identify genetic and epigenetic modifications that may be predictive of the neurobehavioral and neurobiological dysfunctions in offspring induced by gestational alcohol exposure and (2) determine the relationship between structural alterations in the brain induced by gestational alcohol exposure and functional outcomes in offspring. The overarching hypothesis to be tested is that neurobehavioral and neurobiological dysfunctions induced by gestational alcohol exposure are correlated with the genetic background of the affected child and/or epigenetic modifications in gene expression. The identification of genetic and/or epigenetic markers that are predictive of the severity of behavioral and cognitive deficits in children affected by gestational alcohol exposure will have a profound impact on our ability to identify children at risk. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Little is known about alcohol effects on the utero-placental compartment during pregnancy. For the first time, we utilized 2-D DIGE quantitative proteomics to evaluate the role of the uterus in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) pathogenesis. Uterine artery endothelial cells were isolated from pregnant ewes, FAC sorted, validated, and maintained in culture. To mimic maternal binge drinking patterns, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of alcohol (300. mg/dl) in a compensating sealed humidified chamber system equilibrated with aqueous alcohol for 3. h on 3 consecutive days for two weeks. CyDye switch combined with 2-D DIGE followed by MALDI-TOF and tandem MS/MS were utilized. Validation was performed using Western immunoblot analysis. Chronic binge-like alcohol significantly (P<0.05) decreased 30 proteins and increased 19 others. Gene-enrichment and functional annotation cluster analysis revealed significant enrichment (P<0.05) in three categories: glutathione S transferase, thioredoxin, and vesicle transport-related. Furthermore, alcohol differentially altered proteins with certain isoforms being downregulated while others were upregulated. In summary, binge alcohol has specific effects on the maternal uterine proteome, especially those related to oxidative stress. The current study also demonstrates a great need to utilize proteomic approaches for diagnostic, mechanistic and therapeutic aspects of FASD. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Children whose mothers consumed alcohol during pregnancy exhibit widespread brain abnormalities and a complex array of behavioral disturbances. Here, we used a mouse model of fetal alcohol exposure to investigate relationships between brain abnormalities and specific behavioral alterations during adulthood. Results: Mice drank a 10% ethanol solution throughout pregnancy. When fetal alcohol-exposed offspring reached adulthood, we used high resolution MRI to conduct a brain-wide screen for structural changes and found that the largest reduction in volume occurred in the olfactory bulbs. Next, we tested adult mice in an associative olfactory task and found that fetal alcohol exposure impaired discrimination between similar odors but left odor memory intact. Finally, we investigated olfactory bulb neurogenesis as a potential mechanism by performing an in vitro neurosphere assay, in vivo labeling of new cells using BrdU, and in vivo labeling of new cells using a transgenic reporter system. We found that fetal alcohol exposure decreased the number of neural precursor cells in the subependymal zone and the number of new cells in the olfactory bulbs during the first few postnatal weeks. Conclusions: Using a combination of techniques, including structural brain imaging, in vitro and in vivo cell detection methods, and behavioral testing, we found that fetal alcohol exposure results in smaller olfactory bulbs and impairments in odor discrimination that persist into adulthood. Furthermore, we found that these abnormalities in olfactory bulb structure and function may arise from deficits in the generation of new olfactory bulb neurons during early postnatal development. © 2011 Akers et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Regional cortical thickness was evaluated using CIVET processing of 3D T1-weighted images (i) to compare the variation in cortical thickness between 33 participants with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) aged 6-30 years (mean age 12.3. years) versus 33 age/sex/hand-matched controls, and (ii) to examine developmental changes in cortical thickness with age from children to young adults in both groups. Significant cortical thinning was found in the participants with FASD in large areas of the bilateral middle frontal lobe, pre- and post- central areas, lateral and inferior temporal and occipital lobes compared to controls. No significant cortical thickness increases were observed for the FASD group. Cortical thinning with age in a linear model was observed in both groups, but the locations were different for each group. FASD participants showed thinning with age in the left middle frontal, bilateral precentral, bilateral precuneus and paracingulate, left inferior occipital and bilateral fusiform gyri; while controls showed decreases with age in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precuneus gyrus, and bilateral occipital gyrus. A battery of cognitive assessments of memory, attention, motor, and verbal abilities was conducted with many of the FASD participants, but no significant correlations were found between these cognitive scores and regional cortical thickness. Non-invasive measurements of cortical thickness in children to young adults with FASD have identified both key regions of cortex that may be more deleteriously affected by prenatal alcohol exposure as well as cortical changes with age that differ from normal developmental thinning. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy causes a continuum of long-lasting disabilities in the offspring, commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is possibly the most common behavioral problem in children with FASD and devising strategies that ameliorate this condition has great clinical relevance. Studies in rodent models of ADHD and FASD suggest that impairments in the cAMP signaling cascade contribute to the hyperactivity phenotype. In this work, we investigated whether the cAMP levels are affected in a long-lasting manner by ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent period of human gestation and whether the acute administration of the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine ameliorates the ethanol-induced hyperactivity. Methods: From postnatal day (P) 2 to P8, Swiss mice either received ethanol (5. g/kg i.p.) or saline every other day. At P30, the animals either received vinpocetine (20. mg/kg or 10. mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle 4. h before being tested in the open field. After the test, frontal cerebral cortices and hippocampi were dissected and collected for assessment of cAMP levels. Results: Early alcohol exposure significantly increased locomotor activity in the open field and reduced cAMP levels in the hippocampus. The acute treatment of ethanol-exposed animals with 20. mg/kg of vinpocetine restored both their locomotor activity and cAMP levels to control levels. Conclusions: These data lend support to the idea that cAMP signaling system contribute to the hyperactivity induced by developmental alcohol exposure and provide evidence for the potential therapeutic use of vinpocetine in FASD. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Aim: To examine risk and protective factors associated with behavioural problems of children and adolescents following prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: A total of 73 children and adolescents with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were assessed for internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems using the Child Behavior Checklist. Linear regression models were used to determine the effects of diagnostic and environmental risk and protective factors on behaviour, while controlling for age, sex and IQ. Results: Length of time spent in residential care was the most pervasive risk factor associated with internalizing, externalizing and total behavioural problems. A low dysmorphology score was related to more internalizing and total problems. Conclusions: Children and adolescents prenatally exposed to alcohol faced greater risk of substantive behavioural problems (i) if they were less visibly alcohol affected and (ii) the longer time they had spent in residential care. The results underscore the clinical importance of appropriate services and care for less visibly affected children with FASD and highlight the need to attend to children with FASD being raised in institutions. © 2011 The Author(s)/Acta Paediatrica © 2011 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

N2  - Background: Ethanol consumption during pregnancy can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which consists of the complete spectrum of developmental deficits including neurological dysfunction. FASD is associated with a variety of neurobehavioral disturbances dependent on the age and duration of exposure. Ethanol exposure in neonatal rodents can also induce widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration and long-lasting behavioral abnormalities similar to FASD. The developmental stage of neonatal rodent brains that are at the peak of synaptogenesis is equivalent to the third trimester of human gestation. Methods: Male and female C57BL/6By mice were injected with ethanol (20%, 2.5g/kg, 2 s.c. injections) or an equal volume of saline (controls) on postnatal day 7 (P7). Animals were allowed to mature and at 3months were tested on an olfactory habituation task known to be dependent on piriform cortex function, a hippocampal-dependent object place memory task, and used for electrophysiological testing of spontaneous and odor-evoked local field potential (LFP) activity in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and dorsal hippocampus. Results: P7 ethanol induced widespread cell death within 1day of exposure, with highest levels in the neocortex, intermediate levels in the dorsal hippocampus, and relatively low levels in the primary olfactory system. No impairment of odor investigation or odor habituation was detected in P7 ethanol-exposed 3-month-old mice compared to saline controls. However, hippocampal-dependent object place memory was significantly impaired in the P7 ethanol-treated adult mice. Odor-evoked LFP activity was enhanced throughout the olfacto-hippocampal pathway, primarily within the theta frequency band, although the hippocampus also showed elevated evoked delta frequency activity. In addition, functional coherence between the piriform cortex and olfactory bulb and between the piriform cortex and dorsal hippocampus was enhanced in the beta frequency range in P7 ethanol-treated adult mice compared to controls. Conclusions: P7 ethanol induces an immediate wave of regionally selective cell death followed by long-lasting changes in local circuit and regional network function that are accompanied by changes in neurobehavioral performance. The results suggest that both the activity of local neural circuits within a brain region and the flow of information between brain regions can be modified by early alcohol exposure, which may contribute to long-lasting behavioral abnormalities known to rely on those circuits. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Previous research in South Africa revealed very high rates of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), of 46-89 per 1000 among young children. Maternal and child data from studies in this community summarize the multiple predictors of FAS and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS). Method: Sequential regression was employed to examine influences on child physical characteristics and dysmorphology from four categories of maternal traits: physical, demographic, childbearing, and drinking. Then, a structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to predict influences on child physical characteristics. Results: Individual sequential regressions revealed that maternal drinking measures were the most powerful predictors of a child's physical anomalies (R2=30, p<.001), followed by maternal demographics (R2=24, p<.001), maternal physical characteristics (R2=15, p<.001), and childbearing variables (R2=06, p<.001). The SEM utilized both individual variables and the four composite categories of maternal traits to predict a set of child physical characteristics, including a total dysmorphology score. As predicted, drinking behavior is a relatively strong predictor of child physical characteristics (beta=0.61, p<.001), even when all other maternal risk variables are included; higher levels of drinking predict child physical anomalies. Conclusions: Overall, the SEM model explains 62% of the variance in child physical anomalies. As expected, drinking variables explain the most variance. But this highly controlled estimation of multiple effects also reveals a significant contribution played by maternal demographics and, to a lesser degree, maternal physical and childbearing variables. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Alcohol and maternal uterine vascular adaptations during pregnancy-Part I: Effects of chronic in vitro binge-like alcohol on uterine endothelial nitric oxide system and function

N2  - Background: Pregnancy-induced utero-placental growth, angiogenic remodeling, and enhanced vasodilation are all partly regulated by estradiol-17beta-mediated activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production. However, very little is known about the effects of alcohol on these maternal utero-placental vascular adaptations during pregnancy and its potential role in the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In this study, we hypothesized that in vitro chronic binge-like alcohol will decrease uterine arterial endothelial eNOS expression and alter its multisite phosphorylation activity state via disruption of AKT signaling. To study the direct effects of alcohol on uterine vascular adaptations, we further investigated the effects of alcohol on estradiol-17beta-induced uterine angiogenesis in vitro. Methods: Uterine artery endothelial cells were isolated from pregnant ewes (gestational day 120 to 130; term=147), fluorescence-activated cell sorted, validated, and maintained in culture to passage 4. To mimic maternal binge drinking patterns, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of a lower (LD) or higher dose (HD) of alcohol in a compensating sealed humidified chamber system equilibrated with aqueous alcohol for 3hours on 3 consecutive days. Immunoblotting was performed to assess expression of NO system-associated proteins and eNOS multi-site phosphorylation. Following this treatment paradigm, control and binge alcohol-treated cells were passaged, grown for 2days, and then treated with increasing concentrations of estradiol-17beta (0.1, 1, 10, 100nM) in the absence or presence of LD or HD alcohol to evaluate estradiol-17beta-induced angiogenesis index using BrdU proliferation assay. Results: LD and HD binge-like alcohol decreased uterine arterial eNOS expression (p=0.009). eNOS multisite phosphorylation activation state was altered: P635eNOS was decreased (p=0.017), P1177eNOS was not altered, and P495eNOS exhibited an inverse U-shaped dose-dependent relationship with alcohol. LD and HD alcohol decreased the major eNOS-associated protein cav-1 (p<0.001). However, the commonly implicated AKT pathway did not correlate with eNOS posttranslational modifications. Assessment of uterine vascular adaptation via angiogenesis demonstrated that alcohol abrogated the dose-dependent proliferative effects of estradiol-17beta and thus blunted angiogenesis. Conclusions: Thus, the maternal uterine vasculature during pregnancy may be vulnerable to chronic binge-like alcohol. Altered eNOS multisite phosphorylation also suggests that alcohol produces specific effects at the level of posttranslational modifications critical for pregnancy-induced uterine vascular adaptations. Finally, the alcohol and estradiol-17beta data suggest a negative impact of alcohol on estrogen actions on the uterine vasculature. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in varying degrees of neurodevelopmental deficits, growth retardation, and facial dysmorphology. Variation in these adverse outcomes not only depends on the dose and pattern of alcohol exposure but also on less well understood interactions among environmental, genetic, and maternal factors. The current study tested the hypothesis that fetal genotype is an important determinant of ethanol teratogenesis by evaluating effects of ethanol exposure via embryo culture in 3 inbred strains of mice known to differ in the vulnerability of prenatal alcohol exposure in vivo. Methods: Three strains of mice, C57BL/6N (B6), DBA/2 (D2), and 129S6/SvEvTac (129S6) were assessed in a whole embryo culture beginning on embryonic day 8.25, with or without alcohol administration at 88mM for 6hours followed by 42hours culture in ethanol-free media. Results: Contrasting strain differences in susceptibility were observed for the brain, the face, and other organ systems using the Maele-Fabry and Picard scoring system. The forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, heart, optic vesicle, caudal neural tube, and hindlimbs of the B6 mice were severely delayed in growth, whereas compared to the respective controls, only the forebrain and optic vesicle were delayed in the D2 mice, and no effects were found in the 129S6 mice. A large number of cleaved (c)-caspase 3 positive (+) cells were found in regions of the brain, optic vesicles, cranial nerve nuclei V, VII, VIII, and IX as well as the craniofacial primordial; only a few were found in corresponding regions of the B6 controls. In contrast, only a small number of c-caspase 3 immunostaining cells were found in either the alcohol treated or the controls of the D2 embryos and in 129S6 embryos. The independent apoptotic markers TUNEL and Nile blue staining further confirmed the strain differences in apoptotic responses in both the neural tube and craniofacial primordia. Conclusions: Under embryo culture conditions, in which alcohol exposure factors and fetal developmental staging were controlled, and maternal and intrauterine factors were eliminated, the degree of growth retardation and the extent and type of neurodevelopmental teratogenesis varied significantly across strains. Notably, the 129S6 strain was remarkably resistant to alcohol-induced growth deficits, confirming a previous in vivo study, and the D2 strain was also significantly less affected than the B6 strain. These findings demonstrate that fetal genotype is an important factor that can contribute to the variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have deficits in verbal learning and recall. However, the specificity of these deficits has not been adequately tested. In the current study, verbal learning and memory performance of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was compared to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a disorder commonly seen in alcohol-exposed children. Methods: Performance on the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C) was examined in 3 groups of children (N=22/group): (i) heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD (ALC), (ii) nonexposed with ADHD (ADHD), and (iii) nonexposed typically developing (CON). Groups were matched on age, sex, race, ethnicity, handedness, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results: Group differences were noted on learning trials (CON>ADHD>ALC). On the delayed recall trial, CON children performed better than both clinical groups, who did not differ from each other. Children in the ALC group demonstrated poorer recognition than children in the CON and ADHD groups, who did not differ from each other. Marginally significant group differences were noted on retention of previously learned material. Post hoc analyses indicated that ADHD children showed worse retention relative to the CON group, whereas retention in the ALC children remained intact. Conclusions: These data suggest that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and nonexposed children with ADHD show differential patterns of deficit on the CVLT-C. Performance of alcohol-exposed children reflects inefficient encoding of verbal material, whereas performance of the ADHD group may be better characterized by a deficit in retrieval of learned material. Differences noted between clinical groups add to a growing neurobehavioral profile of FASD that may aid in differential diagnosis. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: MRI studies, including recent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies, have shown corpus callosum abnormalities in children prenatally exposed to alcohol, especially in the posterior regions. These abnormalities appear across the range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have demonstrated cognitive correlates of callosal abnormalities in FASD including deficits in visual-motor skill, verbal learning, and executive functioning. The goal of this study was to determine whether inter-hemispheric structural connectivity abnormalities in FASD are associated with disrupted inter-hemispheric functional connectivity and disrupted cognition. Methods: Twenty-one children with FASD and 23 matched controls underwent a 6-minute resting-state functional MRI scan as well as anatomical imaging and DTI. Using a semi-automated method, we parsed the corpus callosum and delineated 7 inter-hemispheric white matter tracts with DTI tractography. Cortical regions of interest (ROIs) at the distal ends of these tracts were identified. Right-left correlations in resting fMRI signal were computed for these sets of ROIs, and group comparisons were made. Correlations with facial dysmorphology, cognition, and DTI measures were computed. Results: A significant group difference in inter-hemispheric functional connectivity was seen in a posterior set of ROIs, the para-central region. Children with FASD had functional connectivity that was 12% lower than in controls in this region. Subgroup analyses were not possible owing to small sample size, but the data suggest that there were effects across the FASD spectrum. No significant association with facial dysmorphology was found. Para-central functional connectivity was significantly correlated with DTI mean diffusivity, a measure of microstructural integrity, in posterior callosal tracts in controls but not in FASD. Significant correlations were seen between these structural and functional measures, and Wechsler perceptual reasoning ability. Conclusions: Inter-hemispheric functional connectivity disturbances were observed in children with FASD relative to controls. The disruption was measured in medial parietal regions (para-central) that are connected by posterior callosal fiber projections. We have previously shown microstructural abnormalities in these same posterior callosal regions, and the current study suggests a possible relationship between the two. These measures have clinical relevance as they are associated with cognitive functioning. Copyright © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to neurodevelopmental impairments and disrupt several neurotransmitter systems. We examined the timing of moderate level alcohol exposure, serotonin transporter gene polymorphic region variation (rh5-HTTLPR), and levels of primary serotonin and dopamine (DA) metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in rhesus monkeys. Methods: Thirty-two 30-month old rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from 4 groups of females were assessed: (i) early alcohol-exposed group (n=9), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6g/kg/d alcohol solution on gestational days 0 to 50; (ii) middle-to-late gestation alcohol-exposed group (n=6), mothers consumed 0.6g/kg/d alcohol solution on gestational days 50 to 135; (iii) a continuous-exposure group (n=8), mothers consumed 0.6g/kg/d alcohol solution on gestational days 0 to 135; and (iv) controls (n=9), mothers consumed an isocaloric control solution on gestational days 0 to 50, 50 to 135, or 0 to 135. Serotonin transporter promoter region allelic variants (homozygous s/s or heterozygous s/l vs. homozygous l/l) were determined. We examined CSF concentrations of the 5-HT and DA metabolites, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), respectively, at baseline and 50hours after separation from cage-mates, when the monkeys were 30months old. Results: Early- and middle-to-late gestation-alcohol exposed monkeys carrying the short allele had lower concentrations of 5-HIAA in CSF relative to other groups. Concentrations of 5-HIAA in CSF were lower for s allele carriers and increased from baseline relative to pre-separation values, whereas 5-HIAA levels in l/l allele carriers were not affected by separation. Monkeys carrying the short allele had lower basal concentrations of HVA in CSF compared with monkeys homozygous for the long allele. Conclusion: Carrying the s allele of the 5-HT transporter increased the probability of reduced 5-HIAA in early- and middle-to-late gestation alcohol-exposed monkeys and reduced HVA at baseline. These findings that prenatal alcohol exposure altered central 5-HT activity in genetically sensitive monkeys raise questions about whether abnormal serotonin biological pathways could underlie some of the psychiatric disorders reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can damage the developing fetus, illustrated by central nervous system dysfunction and deficits in motor and cognitive abilities. Binge drinking has been associated with an increased risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, likely due to increased episodes of ethanol withdrawal. We hypothesized that overactivity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor during ethanol withdrawal leads to excitotoxic cell death in the developing brain. Consistent with this, administration of NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., MK-801) during withdrawal can attenuate ethanol's teratogenic effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, during ethanol withdrawal could effectively attenuate ethanol-related deficits, without the adverse side effects associated with other NMDA receptor antagonists. Methods: Sprague-Dawley pups were exposed to 6.0g/kg ethanol or isocaloric maltose solution via intubation on postnatal day 6, a period of brain development equivalent to a portion of the 3rd trimester. Twenty-four and 36hours after ethanol, subjects were injected with 0, 10, or 15mg/kg memantine, totaling doses of 0, 20, or 30mg/kg. Motor coordination was tested on a parallel bar task and the total number of cerebellar Purkinje cells was estimated using unbiased stereology. Results: Alcohol exposure induced significant parallel bar motor incoordination and reduced Purkinje cell number. Memantine administration significantly attenuated both ethanol-associated motor deficits and cerebellar cell loss in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: Memantine was neuroprotective when administered during ethanol withdrawal. These data provide further support that ethanol withdrawal contributes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The in vitro generation of neural cells from human embryonic stem cells is a powerful tool to acquire better knowledge of the cellular and molecular events involved in early human neural and brain development under physiological and pathological conditions. Prenatal alcohol exposure can induce important anomalies in the developing brain, the embryogenesis being an important critical period for the craniofacial defects and mental disabilities associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Here, we report the generation of neural progenitors (NPs) from human embryonic stem cells. Neuroepithelial progenitors display the morphological and functional characteristics of their embryonic counterparts and the proper timing of neurons and glia cells generation. Immunocytochemical and real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction analyses reveal that cells appeared as clusters during neuroepithelial cell proliferation and that the genes associated with the neuroectodermal (Pax-6) and the endodermic (alpha-fetoprotein) lineages decreased in parallel to the upregulation of the genes of NPs (nestin and Tuj1), followed by their differentiation into neurons (MAP-2+, GABA+), oligodendrocytes [galactocerebroside (GalC+)], and astrocytes (GFAP+). We further demonstrate, for the first time, that human NPs express the endocannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and the enzymes involved in endocannabinoids synthesis (NAPE-PLD) and degradation (FAAH). Using this in vitro culture, we demonstrate that ethanol exposure impairs NPs survival, affects the differentiation of NPs into neurons and astrocytes, disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, and affects the expression of different genes associated with neural differentiation. The results provide new insights into the effects of ethanol on human embryogenesis and neuroprogenitors and offer an opportunity to delineate potential therapeutic strategies to restore early ethanol-induced brain damage. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background: Although many studies have documented deficits in general motor functioning in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), few have employed detailed measurements to explore the specific nature of such disabilities. This pilot study explores whether three-dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis may generate increased knowledge of the effect of intrauterine alcohol exposure on motor control processes by detecting atypical upper-limb movement pattern specificity in children with FAS relative to typically developing (TD) children.Methods: Left and right arm and head movements during a sequential unimanual goal-directed precision task in a sample of children with FAS and in TD children were registered by an optoelectronic tracking system (ProReflex, Qualisys Inc.).Results: Children with FAS demonstrated evidently poorer task performance compared with TD children. Additionally, analyses of arm movement kinematics revealed atypical spatio-temporal organization in the children with FAS. In general, they exhibited longer arm movement trajectories at both the proximal and distal level, faster velocities at the proximal level but slower at the distal level, and more segmented distal movements. Children with FAS also showed atypically augmented and fast head movements during the task performance.Conclusions: Findings indicate neuromotor deficits and developmental delay in goal-directed arm movements because of prenatal alcohol exposure. It is suggested that 3D kinematic analysis is a valid technique for furthering the understanding of motor control processes in children with FAS/fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. A combination with relevant neuroimaging techniques in future studies would enable a more clear-cut interpretation of how atypical movement patterns relate to underlying brain abnormalities. © 2010 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: In experimental models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), cerebellar hypoplasia and hypofoliation are associated with insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) resistance with impaired signaling through pathways that mediate growth, survival, plasticity, metabolism, and neurotransmitter function. To more directly assess the roles of impaired insulin and IGF signaling during brain development, we administered intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of si-RNA targeting the insulin receptor, (InR), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), or IGF-2R into postnatal day 2 (P2) Long Evans rat pups and examined the sustained effects on cerebellar function, structure, and neurotransmitter-related gene expression (P20). Results: Rotarod tests on P20 demonstrated significant impairments in motor function, and histological studies revealed pronounced cerebellar hypotrophy, hypoplasia, and hypofoliation in si-InR, si-IGF-1R, and si-IGF-2R treated rats. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that si-InR, and to a lesser extent si-IGF-2R, broadly inhibited expression of insulin and IGF-2 polypeptides, and insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 receptors in the brain. ELISA studies showed that si-InR increased cerebellar levels of tau, phospho-tau and beta-actin, and inhibited GAPDH. In addition, si-InR, si-IGF-1R, and si-IGF-2R inhibited expression of choline acetyltransferase, which mediates motor function. Although the ICV si-RNA treatments generally spared the neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor expression, si-InR and si-IGF-1R inhibited NT3, while si-IGF-1R suppressed BDNF. Conclusions: early postnatal inhibition of brain InR expression, and to lesser extents, IGF-R, causes structural and functional abnormalities that resemble effects of FASD. The findings suggest that major abnormalities in brains with FASD are mediated by impairments in insulin/IGF signaling. Potential therapeutic strategies to reduce the long-term impact of prenatal alcohol exposure may include treatment with agents that restore brain insulin and IGF responsiveness. © 2011 de la Monte et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes physical, cognitive and behavioural impairments in the child. Deficits are irreversible and persist into adulthood. It was the objective of this study to investigate the specific problems and challenges faced by young adults with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Patients: We examined the biographical development and living situation of 60 adult patients with FAS. In their childhood, all the patients had been diagnosed with FAS in the Muenster University hospital. Methods: Using a structured interview, we asked for the occupational career, health and social problems as well as the current living conditions of the patients. Results: Most patients lived in dependent circumstances. The occupational development was characterized by disruption and failure, and severe social problems were common in patients. 3 in 4 patients were victims of physical and sexual abuse. Conclusions: Due to the variety of impairments caused by prenatal alcohol exposure and the persisting inability to live independently, adults with FAS need intense care, support and assistance. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart  New York.

N2  - Objective: To assess the awareness and knowledge of pregnant Lebanese women about the risks of drinking during pregnancy and the factors that influence their drinking patterns. Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on a sample of 107 women consulting the gynecology outpatient department of Hotel-Dieu de France in Beirut, Lebanon, who completed the T-ACE screening test included in a 21 multiple choice questionnaire which examine knowledge and beliefs about alcohol use during pregnancy, drinking patterns and awareness of fetal alcohol exposure. Results: The 107 women of our sample were all married, between 20 and 41 years old and had mostly a high educational level (86%). Most of the women (47%) were at their first pregnancy. Of the 20 women who self-reported drinking during pregnancy, 60% obtained a positive score on the T-ACE questionnaire, which indicates that more than 11% of the women engaged with potentially high risk drinking for the baby. There is not a significant difference between the different age categories or educational levels. This proportion is lower than that found in international publications. However, the rate of excessive drinking (4 drinks or more on any one occasion in females) was higher and one woman in five reported excessive drinking in the previous year. There is a high level of knowledge that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the child, and the more consumption the more harmful and likely the effects, but there is confusion about the safety of small amounts of alcohol. Women (37%) think that there is a safe level of drinking during pregnancy; 29% tolerate up to one drink a month, 9% tolerate up to one drink a week and one woman thinks having one drink a day is safe. Women who actually drink during pregnancy are more likely to think that alcohol consumption to a certain level is safe. Women (31%) think that beer and/or wine are safe alcohols to a certain level during pregnancy. When asked about the source of this belief, 22% mention a gynecologist but the majority (61%) says it is a personal belief. Women (65%) in our sample are aware that alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to life-long disabilities in a child, such as delayed development (36%), birth defects/deformities (35%) and mental retardation (32%). However, up to 33% of the respondents report having no information about the effects of alcohol on the fetus and two women believe alcohol is not harmful at all. Women with lower levels of education are somewhat less knowledgeable about the risks of alcohol use during pregnancy than those with higher levels of education. There is no association between the drinking patterns of the women with their age, their professional habits and the alcohol consumption of their husbands. The women in our sample seem to be more aware of the necessity to stop smoking rather than stop drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Lebanese women are not fully aware of the recommendations and risks related to drinking during pregnancy. This is the reason why action must be taken to ensure better diffusion of these recommendations and better assessment of alcohol intake during prenatal visits. © L'Encephale, Paris, 2010.

N2  - Background: Although an extensive literature has documented a broad range of cognitive performance deficits in children with prenatal alcohol exposure, little is known about how the neurophysiological processes underlying these deficits may be affected. Event-related potentials (ERPs), which reflect task-specific changes in brain electrical activity, provide a method for examining multiple constituents of cognitive processing at the neural level.Methods: We recorded ERPs in 217 children from Inuit communities in Arctic Quebec (M age = 11.3 years) during 2 different tasks-Go/No-go response inhibition and continuous recognition memory. Children were classified as either alcohol-exposed (ALC) or controls (CON) depending on whether the mother reported binge drinking during pregnancy.Results: Both groups performed comparably in terms of accuracy and reaction time on the tasks, and both tasks elicited the expected effects on ERPs when responses were compared across conditions. However, the ALC group showed slower P2 latencies on Go/No-go, suggesting an altered neurophysiological response associated with initial visual processing of the stimuli. On the memory task, the ALC group showed reduced FN400 amplitude to New items, known as the familiarity effect, and reduced amplitude for the late positive component, possibly reflecting impairment in memory retrieval.Conclusions: These findings show that, even in tasks in which alcohol-exposed children exhibit behavioral performance that is comparable to controls, fetal alcohol exposure is associated with altered neurophysiological processing of response inhibition and recognition memory. The data suggest that fetal alcohol exposure is associated with reduced efficiency in the initial extracting of the meaning of a stimulus, reduced allocation of attention to the task, and poorer conscious, explicit recognition memory processing.

N2  - South Africa has the highest prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) in the world. The purpose of this study was to identify high risk factors associated with drinking alcohol prior to pregnancy recognition in 24 neighborhoods in the Cape Flats outside Cape Town, South Africa. An interviewer assessed risk among 619 pregnant Black/African women between the ages of 18 and 41 years. Logistic regression analyses explored factors associated with drinking alcohol post conception but prior to pregnancy recognition. Forced multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that drinking prior to pregnancy recognition was associated with being younger, single, having better living conditions, smoking, having a longer gestation prior to pregnancy recognition, having a greater number of sexual partners, and a higher incidence of intimate partner violence. Depressive symptoms tended to be higher among alcohol users. These risk factors were consistent with other research on the characteristics of South African women having children with a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and/or of non pregnant women at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. These findings highlight the need for women of child-bearing age to be routinely screened for alcohol use and its associated risk factors. Intervention efforts could be integrated into health initiatives already present in South Africa including the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malnutrition. Preconception care is particularly important since pregnancy recognition often occurs several weeks to months following conception and could be implemented by South African community health workers. These endeavors should facilitate national goals of healthier pregnancies and the elimination of FASDs in South Africa. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Our work and others' show that the teratogenic effects of alcohol can be modified by maternal genetic factors as well as genetic differences in fetal susceptibility and resistance. These genetic factors can interact with prenatal alcohol exposure-induced epigenetic changes in the offspring to result in the kaleidoscope of phenotypes that characterize fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We study this genotype X epigenotype interactions in a rat model of FASD that emulate many symptoms observed in children of alcohol-consuming mothers by focusing on epigenetic alterations of imprinted neurodevelopmental genes. One such gene is iodothyronine deiodinase III (Dio3), an imprinted gene that encodes the thyroid hormone inactivating enzyme and is highly expressed in the placenta and fetal brain. Our previous results indicate restricted thyroid hormone levels in the developing brain as a potential cause of neurodevelopmental deficits where epigenetic alterations of Dio3 expression could be directly responsible. To follow parent of origin allelic expression of Dio3 in the fetal and adult brain of the offspring of alcohol consuming and control dams we reciprocally crossed Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Brown Norway (BN) rats. In one of the reciprocal crosses, aberrant imprinting (altered allelic expression ratio and total expression) of Dio3 was found in the ethanol-exposed fetal frontal cortex with lasting consequences on thyroid hormone levels in this region in adults. Aberrant Dio3 imprinting was also found in the fetal and adult hippocampus of alcohol-exposed males. Hippocampal Dio3 enzyme levels, thyroid hormones, and social behaviors consistent with this state followed the same pattern in males only, suggesting a direct causal relationship between aberrant allelic expression of Dio3 and behavioral consequences. Importantly, all hippocampal effects were absent from females of the affected cross and from both males and females of the reciprocal cross. Thus genetic background and sex modify alcohol-induced alterations in the brain region-specific expression of Dio3 and thereby vulnerability to long-term behavioral deficits. This novel mechanism of vulnerability to prenatal alcohol that can be extended to other imprinted neurodevelopmental genes is one of the potential causes of the wide phenotypic heterogeneity in human FASD.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) constitute a significant health burden in South Africa. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has a prevalence of 60 to 70 per 1000 children of school going age in several communities in the Western and Northern Cape Provinces. FAS is characterized by developmental deficits, including growth and neurological development affecting cognitive ability and behavior, as well as causing distinct facial dysmorphology. The features of FAS and FASD have predominantly been attributed to gestational alcohol exposure with little knowledge about the effects of alcohol on gametogenesis during the preconception stage. The luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) was used to assess global DNA methylation of sperm DNA and bisulfite modification, followed by quantitative pyrosequencing, was used to assess the levels of methylation of selected CpG sites at paternally imprinted loci in sperm DNA and genomic DNA from offspring. The paternally imprinted H19 ICR which controls the reciprocal expression of H19 and IGF2, and the IGDMR controlling expression of DLK1 and GTL2 were investigated. There is significant global DNA hypomethylation of sperm DNA related to increased alcohol consumption (nondrinkers vs heavy drinkers [p = 0.018]; light drinkers vs heavy drinkers [p = 0.016]). A modest effect was observed at the H19 ICR and the IG-DMR loci correlated with alcohol consumption in humans, but no significant effect was observed at the H19 ICR in mouse sperm DNA following alcohol exposure. Interestingly, mice sired by alcohol exposed fathers had significantly reduced H19 ICR CpG methylation at the CTCF1 (p = 0.0017) and CTCF2 (p = 0.0007) binding sites. These studies confirm that paternal preconception alcohol exposure does affect global and locus specific CpG methylation and support an epigenetic mechanism for paternal alcohol related effects in their offspring.

N2  - Children of mothers who drank alcohol during pregnancy may suffer from a range of physical, neurological, and behavioral alterations. Using a rodent model, we have found that administration of choline, an essential nutrient that affects brain development, can mitigate many of the behavioral effects of developmental alcohol exposure. When administered at the same time as prenatal alcohol, choline reduces alcohol-related birth weight deficits and mitigates a variety of ethanol's effects on motor and cognitive development. However, even when administered postnatally (up to postnatal day (PD) 30), after alcohol exposure has ceased, choline supplementation reduces the severity of alcohol-induced deficits on a variety of learning tasks that depend on the functional integrity of the hippocampus, including spatial memory, working memory and trace conditioning of the eyeblink response. Choline plays many roles in brain development and function, acting as a precursor acetylcholine, membrane phospholipids, and as a methyl donor. Ethanol exposure (5.25 g/kg/day) via intubation during the third trimester equivalent brain growth spurt in Sprague-Dawley rats led to long-lasting reductions in hippocampal M1 muscarinic receptor density and increases in M2/4 muscarinic receptor density. Choline supplementation (100 mg/kg/day) from PD 4-30 did not affect M1 densities, but did significantly attenuated ethanol's effects on M2/4 muscarinic receptor density. These data indicate that choline acts, in part, by altering cholinergic functioning. In a separate experiment, rats were exposed to alcohol during the third trimester equivalent and treated with choline (100 mg/kg/day) from PD 2-20. Global DNA methylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was measured. Ethanol exposure altered DNA methylation, an effect that was attenuated with choline supplementation suggesting that choline mitigates ethanol's teratogenic effects, in part, via epigenetic mechanisms. Consistent with this finding, administration of betaine, a choline metabolite and methyl donor, also attenuates behavioral alterations associated with developmental alcohol exposure. These data suggest that choline may attenuate ethanol-related teratogenesis via several mechanisms. Elucidation of choline's mechanisms of action has important implications for the continuing identification of treatments for individuals with FASD.

N2  - It is frequently observed that fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is more easily recognized in young children. To explore how the face changes with age in those with and without histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, we analyzed over 200 Cape Coloured individuals evaluated at 2 time points, 4 years apart using 2 camera systems. We performed 3 comparisons at each age. First, we compared those with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure to controls. Then, we divided the alcohol-exposed children into two groups: those with facial dysmorphology who were classified as either FAS or partial FAS and those without dysmorphology but with heavy alcohol exposure. These nested comparisons allowed us to explore whether a unique set of variables could accurately identify those with heavy exposure who do not have the traditional physical markers of FAS. Data were analyzed using stepwise logistic regression analyses. There were few common variables that distinguished children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from controls at the two time points. At age 5, upper and lower facial depth, palpebral fissure length, minimal frontal width and nasal bridge length distinguished the 3 alcohol-exposed groups versus controls. No measure was a significant predictor in all comparisons of 5 year olds. At ages 5 and 9, when comparing alcohol exposed vs. controls, lower facial depth was a significant predictor. As expected at both ages, in alcohol-exposed children with traditional features of FAS, palpebral fissure length was smaller in the dysmorphic group than in the controls. In the comparison between controls and alcoholexposed children without traditional physical features of FAS, longer outer canthal length was associated with alcohol exposure at ages 5 and 9. At each age and in each comparison, inclusion of additional variables in the logistic regression model improved classification accuracy. Given the different models developed to predict group membership at ages 5 and 9, these data suggest that the rates of growth in the face vary during childhood development. The patterns of growth may mask some of the most characteristic features of FAS, making it more difficult to identify those who have been exposed prenatally. Interestingly, the classification rates were not dramatically different at the two ages. These data suggest that additional facial measures may be needed when assessing older children or adolescents for prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Alcohol use during human pregnancy is linked to congenital heart defects and to intrauterine growth retardation associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Objectives of our study were to determine: (i) effects of an acute, binge-drinking, ethanol (EtOH) dose during gastrulation on cardiac and placental development; and (ii) whether folate (FA) will reverse the deleterious effects of EtOH on embryogenesis by modulating WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Both avian and mouse models were analyzed. Exposure of embryos to EtOH during gastrulation induced cardiac and valve defects and embryonic growth restriction. Severity of anomalies related to timing of exposure. To initiate cardiogenesis in the embryo, the canonical Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) acts extracellularly to suppress WNT/beta-catenin signaling. This results in an up regulation of Hex (a marker of the primary heart field) and Islet-1 (a marker of the second heart field), two inducers of cardiogenesis. Exposure of gastrulating embryos to EtOH delayed Hex and Islet-1 gene expression within the cardiogenic crescent. This indicated an inhibition of Dkk1 antagonism and prolongation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling. An acute exposure of pregnant mice during gastrulation on E6.75 (morning of vaginal plug is E0.5) to an accepted binge-drinking dose of EtOH (two i.p. injections of 2.9g/kg of body weight, administered 3 hrs apart) induced cardiac valve defects in 87% of embryos and adverse changes in myocardial and placental blood flow, determined noninvasively on E15.5 by echocardiography. We had previously shown that FA supplementation overrides WNT/beta-catenin inhibition of cardiac gene induction in the heart fields. FA was tested for protective effects against EtOH exposure during cardiac specification. In the avian model, culture medium supplemented with both FA and EtOH resulted in normal Hex and Islet-1 expression and heart development. In the mouse, FA supplementation (10.5 mg/kg) provided in the chow beginning on E0.5 followed by exposure to EtOH on E6.75 showed 100% of embryos displaying normal cardiac function, valve development, and normal placental formation on E15.5, as assessed by echocardiography and by immunohistochemistry. We conclude that FA supplementation prevents the deleterious effects of alcohol by suppressing WNT/beta-catenin signaling by augmenting Wnt antagonism possibly by DNA methylation, thus allowing normal induction of gene expression and cardiomyocyte differentiation during development.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Despite alcohol's toxicity, it is widely used across the world and its effects on the premature newborn are still being explored. While newborns are already a vulnerable and high risk population, fetal alcohol exposure is thought to predispose the newborn to infections which can significantly impact morbidity. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that fetal ethanol (ETOH) exposure causes alveolar macrophage (AM) dysfunction in the developing lung but function was modulated by availability of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), nonoxidative metabolites of alcohol, are potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure and are linked to disruption of cellular functions. However, additional studies are needed to determine if these biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure contribute to alveolar macrophage dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the oleic acid form of FAEEs on the function of AM and to determine if GSH can modulate these effects Methods Used: The NR8383 cell line of rat AM was exposed to: control conditions, + 25 muM ethyl oleate, or + 50 muM ethyl oleate (60 min). After FAEE exposure, some cells were treated with GSH (500 muM) for 4 hrs. Using fluorescent microscopy, phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) was determined using MitoTracker Red CM-H2X Ros. mROS and phagocytosis was quantified as relative fluorescent units (RFU)/cell. Summary of Results: In these studies, FAEE exposure impaired the phagocytic function of AM and these affects were attenuated by the presence of GSH. There was a 10% decrease of mROS and 40% increase in phagocytosis in the cells treated with glutathione after exposure to oleic acid in comparison to cells exposed only to oleic acid. Conclusions: Acute exposure to FAEE (specifically ethyl oleate), increased AM mROS and impaired phagocytosis. Treatment with GSH attenuated these effects suggesting that FAEE exposure alone promoted oxidative stress. We hypothesize that FAEE due to prenatal alcohol exposure can contribute to the dysfunction of developing AM and that these effects may be modulated by GSH.

N2  - We have observed that moderate drinking during pregnancy alters placental gene expression (Rosenberg et al., Alcohol. 44:673-90, 2010), suggesting that ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene expression might serve as a biomarker of fetal alcohol exposure. The present study addressed the question whether maternal drinking during pregnancy alters fetal cortical gene expression in a manner similar to the changes we have observed in placenta. Harlan Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed a mean of 2.72 g ethanol/kg during a fourhour period each day throughout pregnancy, a level that produces a mean peak serum ethanol level of 84 mg/dL. On gestational day 20, rat placental:fetal units were removed by Csection and whole placental and fetal cortical tissues rapidly dissected and frozen. RNA was extracted from both tissue types and processed for gene microarray analysis. Moderate drinking during pregnancy significantly altered the expression of 1041 genes in placenta and 1426 genes in cortex. Ethanol exposure repressed expression of the large majority of genes altered in both tissue types. However, only about 7% of the differentially expressed genes in placenta were also altered in cortex. In contrast to individual gene analyses, gene ontology analyses in both tissue types indicated that ethanol exposure significantly altered genes associated with the development and morphology in several tissue systems as well as immunologic responses. The top three categories that emerged from gene ontology analysis were cardiovascular as well as neural systems development and cell death. These results suggest that the analyses of placental gene ontology categories for specific organ systems may be informative of ethanol-induced alterations in fetal tissues. Given increasing evidence that cerebral microvascular development plays a critical role in neural development, our data suggest that investigating ethanol-induced perturbations in the placental vascular network may be a particularly fruitful target system for examining the utility of placenta as a biomarker tissue for fetal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol effects.

N2  - Introduction: An ongoing challenge for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is to expand recognizable facial features so that individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure who lack the classic facial phenotype can be identified, allowing for early interventions. This study aims to localize morphological changes related to prenatal alcohol exposure and determine if these can help predict exposure status. Methods: The sample included 68 healthy controls (HC), 68 heavy alcohol exposed (HE), and 23 children with partial FAS (PFAS), and 21 with FAS from the Cape Town Colored community (M age = 10.2; 89 males). 3D facial images were registered using landmarks defined by the anthropologists. The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on surface deformations and curvatures were examined using general linear models with age and gender as covariates. Group comparisons included HC vs. FAS (most extreme comparison), FAS+PFAS (expanding the FAS group to include PFAS), FAS+PFAS+HE (broadest comparison including children with a range of alcohol exposure), PFAS+HE (removing FAS, this comparison removes those with the most extreme facial dysmorphology), and HE (least extreme comparison). Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to predict alcohol exposure status. Results: The surface deformation from posterior to anterior in the HC group were detected significantly (corrected p < 0.05) larger than that in the FAS and FAS+PFAS groups in nasal bridge, nose, midface and jaw, and significantly taller than FAS+PFAS+HE in nose. The HC group also showed significantly longer and wider face than FAS, FAS+PFAS, and FAS+PFAS+HE. Although no significant curvature patterns were identified with corrected p < 0.05, maps of t statistics showed that the philtrum and mid-face regions in the HC group were more curved than those in the FAS and FAS+PFAS groups. The SVM prediction rates consistently dropped from the most extreme comparison to the least extreme one: 92.14% for HC vs FAS, 77.68% for HC vs FAS+PFAS, 61.67% for HC vs FAS+PFAS+HE, 57.23% for HC vs PFAS+HE, and 55.15% for HC vs HE. Conclusion: These results validate our hypothesis that fetal alcohol exposure had significant impact on facial dysmorphology, detected in the areas of nose, nasal bridge, mid-face, philtrum, and jaw, and facial width and length. Further studies will help find the relations between the facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and classic FAS facial phenotypes.

N2  - Facial anthropometry coupled with logistical regression has been shown to provide a sensitive complement for identifying FASD (fetal alcohol spectrum disorder). Facial anthropometry is inherently affected by the amount of facial adipose tissue that would limit its robustness. This study was designed to investigate the underlying craniofacial bone in a C57BL/6J mouse model. The objective is to identify specific craniofacial bone dysmorphology as a function of age and exposure and to establish their correlation to human anthropometry analogues. Three treated groups, ALC-ALC (pre- and pregnancy alcohol with 4.8 % (v/v) alcohol liquid), ALC-PF (pre alcohol and a calorically matched liquid pregnancy diet), and CHOW (ad lib chow/water), were examined. The pregnancy exposure lasted from embryonic day (E) 7- E16. All delivered pups were culled to 6/litter and surrogate fostered. On postnatal days (P)7 and 21, craniofacial bones were imaged using 3D microCT, and 12 craniofacial bone measurements were defined as mouse equivalents of a subset used in human studies. Data was examined by ANOVA and Logistic Regression to discern features that predict alcohol exposure with high accuracy. Longitudinal changes were tracked within each group. At P7, seven differences were observed for ALC-ALC and five for ALC-PF compared to Chow pups. Two widths (minimal frontal and inner canthal) together with one depth (middle facial) resulted in 83% (sensitivity) classification of ALC-ALC mice vs. 86% (specificity) of the PF. At P21, the differences between ALC-PF and CHOW groups diminished and lead to very low classification sensitivity (48%). ALC-ALC group maintained seven measurement differences from both CHOW and ALC-PF controls. But a lower sensitivity (75%) was observed among ALC-ALC and Chow with measures including inner canthal, inner orbital width and nasal length. The longitudinal comparison showed less growth of CHOW (minimal frontal and inner canthal width). These results suggest that dietary and alcohol effects contribute to craniofacial dysmorphology, where smaller measurements for both ALC-ALC and ALC-PF pups are seen at P7 and excellerated growth of ALC-PF at P21. There is evidence that alcohol induced dysmorphology changes with age in part due to increased relative growth of exposed individuals. This information could be important to assist in clinical variants of human FASD patients.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol abuse causes important structural and functional brain defects and is estimated to negatively impact up to 1% of pregnancies in the United States. Unfortunately, extensive efforts to promote alcohol abstinence during pregnancy have failed to reduce the incidence. A number of promising interventional strategies have been devised; however, successful implementation likely will require early identification of affected individuals. Currently, there is no effective means of identifying affected children during the perinatal period. We hypothesize that fetal ultrasonographic measurements, individually or collectively, can predict prenatal alcohol exposure. A human clinical pilot study (PMID:19444822) has established the potential for fetal ultrasonography to provide a method for prenatal identification of affected children. However, that study depended upon self-reporting of alcohol ingestion to establish exposure and is preliminary. Ultrasonography, unlike other imaging technologies like MRI, is already routinely employed during pregnancy. Additional ultrasound advantages over MRI are that examinations are less expensive, faster and not subject to motion artifact. A collection of 12 measurements of the skull, eyes, brain and legs were obtained from 76-day gestation sheep utilizing transabdominal ultrasonography. Subjects received either saline, 1.75 or 2.5 g/kg alcohol IV on three consecutive days per week from gestation day 4-41. Intraorbital and frontothalamic distances were significantly greater in the high alcohol group compared to the low alcohol and saline groups (n = 10, 13 and 14 respectively. We conclude that further efforts to develop a set of prenatal ultrasonographic measurements for FASD screening are warranted. Supported by NIAAA Grant AA0171290 (TAC).

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is diagnosed by the presence of growth retardation, central nervous system damage, and a distinct pattern of facial dysmorphology. FAS reflects the severe end of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), but the prevalence of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in FASD cases without facial dysmorphology may be 10 fold higher than FAS. Diagnosis of nondysmorphic FASD cases is very difficult, limiting opportunities for treatment and intervention. The current study used a mouse model to test whether variations in development of facial features induced by prenatal alcohol exposure are detectable using quantitative morphometric methods, and whether the duration of alcohol exposure is a contributing factor to variable dysmorphology. Female C56BL/6J mice were divided into four groups. Chow group was given ad libitum chow and water throughout the experimental period. The alcohol groups and the pair-fed (PF) group were given a liquid diet with 4.8% alcohol for 2 weeks prior to mating. During pregnancy, the ALC groups were given the alcohol diet either on embryonic days 7 (E7)-E11 or E7-E16. The PF dams were given equal volumes of an isocaloric diet on E7-E16. All embryos were analyzed at E17. Analyses included 15 facial measurements (derived as analogues of human anthropometry measures from a previous FAS study), along with measures of crown-rump lengths, weights, ocular abnormalities, head circumference, and limb development. The 4.8% alcohol liquid diet from E7-E16 caused distinct facial dysmorphology including altered whisker pad, upper facial depth, midfacial depth, and lower facial height (all p < 0.002). Two measures, upper facial depth and midfacial depth, were identified as predictors for alcohol treatments that could classify the E7-E16 alcohol group from nonexposed PF and Chow controls in a discriminant analysis, with overall correct classification 79%. However, in E7-E11 group, only upper facial depth, and minimal frontal height (both p < 0.01) were different between ALC and Controls. Alcohol significantly reduced crown-rump length, head circumference, and embryo weight in E7-E16 group, but only crown-rump length in E7-E11 group. The duration of alcohol exposure is an important factor contributing to severity of facial dysmophology and growth retardation. The E7-E11 alcohol exposure showed considerably reduced dysmorphology compared to E7-E16 alcohol exposure.

N2  - Prenatal choline supplementation has been shown to mitigate neurodevelopmental damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in rats suggesting its potential as an intervention for FASD. The recommended human choline intake during pregnancy is 450 mg/day and 3500 mg/day is the tolerable upper limit or roughly a dose of 60 mg in a 60 kg woman. Studies in rodents have exceeded this range, with no apparent side effects at 200 mg/kg in mice and 250 mg/kg in pregnant rats. However, in baboons, choline supplementation at a dose roughly equivalent to 20 mg/kg together with alcohol resulted in hepatotoxicity likely due to lower choline oxidase activity in this species. Sheep, like primates, also have lower choline oxidase activity compared to rodents, and therefore likely have a lower tolerable upper intake level of choline than rats. Therefore, we believe the ovine model is appropriate for investigating the safety and efficacy of choline supplementation. Three groups, normal control, low choline (10 mg/kg), high choline (3500 mg/kg) received vehicle or microencapsulated choline (Reashure, Balchem) once daily for 30 days at which time animals were sacrificed and the livers were perfused with formalin. Tissues were paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Three veterinary pathologists blinded to treatment group independently scored the sections for presence, severity and distribution of the following parameters: hydropic degeneration, necrosis, megalocytosis, vacuolar degeneration, regeneration, hepatic and capsular fibrosis, inflammation and cell type. No pathological changes were identified that could be attributed to choline toxicity. Though these findings support the safety of choline supplementation in sheep at doses like those recommended in humans, subjects were not pregnant, did not receive choline for a duration as long as a whole pregnancy and did not receive concurrent alcohol. Studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of choline supplementation in sheep during pregnancy and with concurrent alcohol exposure are now underway. Supported by NIAAA Grant AA0171290 (TAC).

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), but wide phenotypic variations in facial, brain, and neurobehavioral abnormalities are evident. Factors contributing to this phenotypic variation have been identified suing rodent models of alcohol exposure using various delivery methods including oral gavage, liquid diets, injections, vapor inhalation, and free choice drinking. Comparisons between inbred strains of mice have implicated genetic differences as an important risk factor, but strain differences in pharmacokinetics, alcohol preference, stress responses, nutritional status, and difficulties in matching blood alcohol levels, have made it difficult to determine genetic contributions to FASD. This study examined alcohol delivery to pregnant mouse dams of two different inbred strains, one known to be vulnerable to prenatal alcohol-induced teratogenesis (C57BL/6J; [B6]) and the other known to be resistant (129S6/SvEv/Tec; [S129]), using an ethanol vapor chamber inhalation system. Careful regulation of this system provides a means to control alcohol exposure and match the blood alcohol levels produced in the two strains, regardless of any strain differences in pharmacokinetics. Exposure of pregnant dams of each strain to alcohol vapor was limited to 4 or 6 hrs, beginning on embryonic day 8.25, followed by air alone for 44 or 42 hr additional growth. Control groups were exposed to air alone. Embryos were then collected on E10 and assessed for teratogenesis and growth retardation using van Maele-Fabry scoring. By fine tuning vapor concentration settings, the settings were able to consistently target blood alcohol profiles with peak levels of 200, 300, or 400 mg/dl over the testing period established for both strains. The B6 embryos showed alcohol-induced growth retardation for somite number, caudal neural tube, branchial processes, and optic system at 300 mg/dl. At 400 mg/dl additional heart, maxillary process, and fore-, mid- and hindbrain developmental delays were evident. A concentration-dependent decreased in embryo survival and litter size was also found for B6 dams. The 129S strain showed limited delay forelimb formation at 300 mg/dl. Further study in higher dose is in progress. These findings using in vivo exposure at comparable blood alcohol levels are consistent with our previous studies embryo culture methods.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can have detrimental effects on the developing fetus, resulting in a constellation of developmental, behavioral and CNS deficits known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Many variables play a role in susceptibility to FASD, including genetics. Work from our lab and others has shown that C57BL/6J (B6) mice are susceptible to ethanolinduced teratogenesis, while DBA/2J (D2) mice are relatively resistant. We have demonstrated that maternal genotype also plays an important role in susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of ethanol. In this study, we further elucidate the genetic pathways mediating susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis by examining global changes in gene expression in embryonic and placental-decidual tissue derived from B6 and D2 mice. Methods: We generated both homozygous (B6B6 and D2D2) and reciprocal heterozygous (B6D2 and D2B6) offspring genotypes. On gestational day 9, females were given 5.8 g/kg ethanol (20% w:v) or maltose-dextrin by oral gavage; a nonintubated control group was also included. 4 hrs later, tissue was harvested and subsequently processed for microarray analysis. Five litters were used for each combination of treatment, tissue type and strain, for a total of 120 arrays. For the analysis, we removed probe sets that contained SNPs that differed across strains. Data were then normalized, log transformed and filtered by 'absent' and 'present' status for a final set of 13,558 probe sets that were used for ANOVA and Gene Ontology analysis. Results: We report on genes with significant main effects of strain, ethanol, tissue and/or strain by ethanol interactions. In general, we found that strain type explained the most variability in expression. For the probe sets significantly different in the homozygous strains, we found enrichment in metabolic and development related genes. Ethanol treatment affected the expression of mRNA processing and metabolism genes. Expression of development related genes significantly differed among tissues. Most surprisingly, for the ethanol by strain interaction, we found that the majority of differentially regulated genes were specifically affected in the B6B6, followed by the B6D2 strains. Conclusion: We have discovered gene expression differences mediated by both genetic and maternal effects that potentially modulate susceptibility to ethanol-induced teratogenesis.

N2  - The hippocampus is a site of adult neurogenesis believed to contribute to learning and memory. Previous work in our lab has shown that exposure to moderate levels of alcohol throughout gestation results in a diminished neurogenic response to environmental enrichment within the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (Choi et al., 2005). The goal of the current research is to determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure impairs the ability of newlygenerated adult dentate granule cells (DGCs) to incorporate into spatial memory networks. For these studies, we utilized Nestin-CreERT2:YFP bitransgenic mice in which tamoxifen exposure induces YFP reporter gene expression in nestin+ neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and all subsequent progeny. Mice received tamoxifen injections at a dose of 180 mg/kg/day, i.p., for five consecutive days, and were subsequently trained on hippocampaldependent tasks 6 to 8 weeks following the final injection. Mice were either trained on the 2- way separation radial arm maze using 2 training sessions per day for 2 days, followed by 3 days of memory recall testing; or the mice were exposed to a 7 trial trace fear conditioning paradigm and tested for memory recall 24 hours later to context and tone. Ninety minutes following the recall tests, mice were sacrificed and evaluated for the expression of c-Fos and YFP reporter colocalization. Preliminary data indicate that approximately 3% of YFP labeled adult-born DGCs express c-Fos during recall in the radial arm maze paradigm, as compared to 0% in behavioral test control mice. Quantification of c-Fos/YFP colocalization following trace conditioning is currently underway. Once optimized, these paradigms will be used to determine the impact of prenatal alcohol on functional incorporation of YFP+ DGCs.

N2  - We hypothesized that some of the deleterious effects of ethanol on the developing brain may be due to the disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in brain cells as cholesterol deficiencies cause brain anomalies associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities similar to the ones reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. We have previously shown that ethanol induces cholesterol efflux in astrocytes, but not in neurons, through the upregulation of the cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Astrocytes also secrete lipoproteins; as ABCA1 and ABCG1 are involved in the biogenesis and maturation of lipoproteins, which are cholesterol acceptors and extract cholesterol from both neurons and astrocytes, we hypothesized that ethanol may upregulate lipoprotein production in astrocytes and, through this mechanism, increase cholesterol efflux from astrocytes and neurons. Using fast liquid lipoprotein chromatography (FPLC) with a size exclusion column, we separated astrocytegenerated lipoproteins (A-Lps) from astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM). The levels of phospholipids, cholesterol and apolipoprotein E (Apo E), the three main components of A-Lps, were quantified in 71 fractions eluted from FPLC by ELISA (ApoE) and enzymatic assays (phospholipids and cholesterol). We found that after 48 h ethanol treatments, the levels of phospholipids, cholesterol and ApoE were significantly increased in elution fractions 16-36, suggesting a significant increase in the production and release of A-Lps. In addition, we found that while the ACM containing normal A-Lps were able to induce cholesterol efflux from naive neurons and astrocytes, the ACM from ethanol treated astrocytes, containing more A-Lps, further increased cholesterol efflux from both cell types. To explore the consequences of the exposure of neurons to cholesterol acceptors we incubated neurons with High Density Lipoproteins (HDL) for different lengths of time; 3- and 5-day incubations with HDL resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular cholesterol and neuronal survival in cortical primary neurons. Based on these results, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure may cause neuronal cell death by increasing the release of lipoproteins from astrocytes leading to increased cholesterol efflux and reduced cholesterol content in neurons.

N2  - Evidence converging from clinical and preclinical studies of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) shows that motor deficits are associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Children exposed to alcohol in utero display impairments of manual dexterity, strength of grip, and postural balance. However, little is known about motor sequencing in this population. Given that motor sequencing is critically important for performance of skilled tasks such as typing and writing, the present study investigated the neural aspects of this function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve right-handed children with FASD, ages 12 to 18, and 11 age- and gender matched controls participated. The participants completed a test battery including a motor sequencing task, in which they performed simple and complex finger sequences using the dominant or the nondominant hand. The motor sequences were administered using a procedure described by Haaland et al. (2004). In this procedure, a simple sequence involved making key presses 5 times with the index (1), middle (2), or ring (3) finger (e.g. 1,1,1,1,1; 2,2,2,2,2). A complex sequence involved performance of 5 key presses with the 3 fingers in a mixed order (1,3,2,1,2; 3,1,2,3,1 etc.). Whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to record BOLD signals during performance of the motor sequencing task. Analyses of the behavioral data showed that the two groups differed in performances of complex, but not simple, sequences. The FASD group took longer and made more errors than the control group on the complex sequences. The fMRI data revealed that the FASD group showed greater BOLD signal changes than the control group during performance of the simple sequences, despite the lack of group differences on behavioral measures. For example, when performing the simple sequences with the right hand, the FASD group showed greater task-related BOLD signal changes in the left inferiortemporal, right orbitofrontal, and left occipital cortices, as well as in a region along the calcarine fissure. In contrast, the control group displayed greater bold signal changes in bilateral occipital, bilateral temporal, bilateral frontal regions as well as in the cerebellum and the basal ganglia during performance of the complex sequences. This pattern is consistent with the finding that children with FASD display difficulty with complex tasks that involve cognitive control.

N2  - The underlying physiological abnormalities associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in children are poorly understood. Identifying both basic sensory and cognitive deficits in young children with FASD is important to facilitate a broader understanding of the deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure; as is identifying potential markers for early diagnosis of FASD in young children. We recruited children aged 3 to 6 years [9 FASD and 18 age-matched healthy controls (HC)] to participate in a study to characterize auditory and somatosensory integration using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Bilateral tones and air puff tactile stimulation to bilateral index fingers were presented both individually and synchronously to the children as they viewed a silent movie while resting with their head in the MEG machine. Movement compensation software was used to account for head position movement throughout the data collection period. Trials with movements or other artifacts were rejected and the remaining trials were signal averaged. MRIs of the children were used to register the cortical sources identified with MEG to the structural anatomy. The time courses of the primary auditory sources were compared between the FASD and the HC children. In the auditory alone condition, there was a trend for a delayed response in the FASD. Preliminary results also showed a delayed auditory response in the primary auditory cortex in the FASD group during the synchronous auditory/somatosensory condition. The peak latency of the right hemisphere auditory M100 response was significantly (t = 2.0; p = 0.04) delayed in the children with FASD (150 ms) relative to the healthy control children (122 ms). These results suggest possible auditory processing deficits in children with FASD relative to healthy control children, which are amplified in the synchronous auditory/somatosensory condition. Basic sensory processing deficits and deficits in cortical integration including multisensory processing may play a role in improper development of higher cognitive functions. Further research exploring the relationship between sensory and cognitive deficits is needed to better understand the effect of auditory deficits on outcome in these young children.

N2  - Previous studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with poorer reading and phonological awareness (e.g., Streissguth et al.,1994; Adnams et al., 2007). Fetal alcohol exposure is also associated with slower processing speed (Jacobson et al., 1993, 1994; Kable & Coles., 2004; Burden et al., 2005). The aim of the study was to examine the degree to which effects of alcohol on reading rate and phonological awareness mediate reading comprehension deficits in a heavy alcohol exposed cohort in Cape Town, South Africa. 47 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) children (M age = 11.3, SD = 1.2) were administered the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability and the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhaB). The 31 mothers of the heavy alcohol exposed children reported drinking an average of 5.1 drinks/day, which were concentrated on 2.8 days/week. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with slower reading rate (beta = -0.30, p < 0.05) and poorer reading comprehension (beta = -0.31, p < 0.05), after control for potential confounders including maternal smoking during pregnancy and child age. No differences were seen in relation to child gender. The effect on reading comprehension remained significant after controlling for IQ, suggesting that reading comprehension may be a specific target of alcohol exposure. On the PhaB, prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with slower naming speed for digits and pictures (beta = -0.33 and )0.35, respectively, both ps < 0.05). Prenatal exposure was not related to alliteration or rhyme but was related to poorer performance on spoonerisms, a more challenging form of phonological processing (beta = -0.31, p < 0.05). The effect of alcohol on reading comprehension was mediated by the effect of alcohol on reading rate (z = -2.04, p < 0.05). The effect on reading comprehension was also mediated by spoonerisms (z = -2.09, p < 0.05). These findings indicate deficits in both reading rate, a measure of automaticity, and phonological awareness, two important aspects of reading, mediate the alcohol-related deficits in reading comprehension. The mediating role of reading rate is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating alcohol-related processing speed deficits, which are already evident during infancy, and with recent findings suggesting that white matter integrity may be a specific target of fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure has been associated with impaired verbal learning and memory (Mattson & Roebuck, 2002). The aim of our study was to replicate previous findings on effects of heavy exposure on the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version and to extend these to children with moderate exposure. Data from two prospective longitudinal cohorts were analysed. The Cape Town (CT) Cohort (mean age = 9.2 yr, SD = 0.41) included 6 children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 14 with partial FAS (PFAS), 9 nonsyndromal with heavy exposure (HE), and 18 controls born to abstainers or light drinkers from the same community. The Detroit Cohort (mean age = 14.4 yr; SD = 0.62) included 19 children with heavy exposure (AA/day > 1.0 oz), 21 with moderate exposure (AA/day 0.5- 0.99), and 251 light- to nonexposed (AA/day < 0.5) controls. The primary impairment in the CT heavily-exposed children occurred at the level of encoding new information. There were significant between-group differences in total number of words learned after five learning trials; post hoc analysis indicated that FAS and PFAS groups performed more poorly than controls, ps < 0.05. Consistent with previous research, the CT alcohol-exposed children learned the information at a slower rate than nonexposed controls. Significant short-delay but not longdelay recall deficits were seen in the CT children. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were found between groups for number of words learned across the five learning trials in the moderate-heavy exposed Detroit Cohort. Significant between-groups differences on short- and long-delay recall indicate that the primary impairment for the Detroit alcoholexposed children was at the level of retrieving information. These effects were dosedependent; recall by the moderately-exposed children was intermediate between the light- to nonexposed and heavy-exposed participants, ps < 0.05. Furthermore, alcohol-exposed children in both CT and Detroit showed poorer recognition memory. Thus, only the heavilyexposed children in CT showed learning (encoding) deficits in this relatively simple list learning task, but both moderate and heavy exposure were associated with poorer recognition and recall, suggesting that memory retrieval is particularly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Purpose of the Study. Prenatal alcohol exposure affects neural development and is associated with white matter deficits. The corpus callosum (CC) which joins the left and right hemispheres is frequently affected; neuroimaging studies have identified alterations in white matter integrity in CC. This study examines the extent to which prenatal exposure is associated with inefficiencies in cognitive tasks that require cross callosal transfer of information in order to support the argument that deficits in cognition and behavior observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from effects on brain connectivity in this region. Methods. 234 young adults (M age: 22.78, SD: 1.79) were evaluated as part of a longitudinal study of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four groups of participants included: Unexposed Controls (CON: n = 58), Alcohol Exposed and Dysmorphic (DYSM: n = 47), Alcohol exposed with no physical effects (ETOH: n = 75), and Unexposed volunteers who qualified for Special Education Services as children (SpecED = 54). Neuropsychological assessment included the following measures that require cross-callosal transfer of information for efficient performance: Sensory: Finger Localization (Benedetti, 1988); Auditory: Dichotic listening measured using the Scan-A (Keith, 1995), Visual: Visual Alexia (Leff, et al. 2001). Subtests of these measures, which required integration of information across hemisphere, were selected. These included the Bilateral Condition on finger localization, Competing Reversal on the Scan-A and identification of words in the left visual field on Visual Alexia. Results. For each assessment measure, multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures compared performance among the four experimental groups. Deficits in performance by the DYSM Group were noted on all measures of interest. However, measures sensitive to cross callosal interference were not more affected than other outcomes and interactions between group status and laterality measures were not found. Conclusion. Alcohol-affected young adults demonstrated a generalized deficit in cognitive performance across a number of measures. However, these deficits are not confined to those measures associated with cross modal transmission of information suggesting that deficits cannot be attributed to effects of their prenatal exposure on callosal functioning. It is more likely that there is a general loss of processing efficiency.

N2  - A pilot study examining the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of choline supplementation in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is underway. Preclinical data (J. Thomas et al.) suggest that post-natal choline supplementation in rats may attenuate some of the cognitive and behavioral abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. The literature shows that peri-natal choline supplementation has direct positive effects on hippocampal growth and function in normal development and in pre-natal alcohol exposure. No human choline trials have yet been completed in FASD. Twenty children between the ages of 2.5 and 5.0 years have been enrolled in a nine-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of choline supplementation. The dose, 500 mg per day, is double the recommended daily intake level but below the upper tolerable limit for this age (100 mg). Outcome data currently being collected include measures of global cognitive development (Mullen Scales), memory (elicited imitation paradigm, P. Bauer), executive functioning (conflict / delay, S. Carlson), behavior ratings (Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist), and evoked response potential (ERP) / visually evoked potential (VEP) measures. Thus far, only one child has dropped out (because of refusal to take the study agent). There have been no adverse events. Compliance has been very good as evidenced by packet counts, logsheets, and serum choline levels collected at baseline and 1 month (presented here). Administration of the study agent has been modified slightly in 9 cases (dose splitting, adulterating, etc.) in order to improve child compliance. Reports of potential side effects have been low. Most commonly seen have been fishy body odor and increased urination. Because the blind is still in place, it is not yet known if there are group differences in these or other potential side effects. Thus far, choline supplementation at 500 mg. per day appears to be associated with minimal side effects and is reasonably well-tolerated by 2-4 year old children with FASD. Parental interest and compliance have been strong over the course of the study.

N2  - Background. Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) depends on health care providers detecting maternal risk drinking in pregnancy. NIAAA and ACOG recommend using the T-ACE, an economical/sensitive screen. We reported that a more stringent T-ACE total score cut-point (3 vs. 2) increased specificity in identifying maternal risk drinking and alcoholrelated neurobehavioral dysfunction in children (Chiodo et al, 2010). If validated, the TACER3 could increase efficient clinical practice. Objective. Assess how changing the T-ACE cut-point affects detection of risk drinking. Methods. Self-reported peri-conceptional and in-pregnancy drinking was assessed with semistructured interviews and alcohol screens in a prospective subsample of 239 African-American mothers given an in-pregnancy T-ACE. Both the original T-ACE risk criterion (total score of 2 - T-ACE) and the revised T-ACE definition criterion (total score of 3 - TACER3) were analyzed. ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons compared prepregnancy and pregnancy alcohol consumption quantity and frequency measures by risk category. Categories include: 1) No Risk Group (NRG) = no risk for pregnancy alcohol use based on both T-ACE and TACER3 criteria (n = 140); 2) At Risk Group (ARG) based on both T-ACE and TACER3 criteria (n = 28); and 3) Change Risk Group (CRG) identified as at-risk with the original T-ACE criterion but not at-risk using the revised TACER3 criterion (n = 71). Results. The 71 women (30%) in the Change Risk Group (CRG) had patterns of alcohol use similar to the no risk group (NRG). As predicted, post hoc analysis revealed that the at-risk group (ARG) had significantly more alcohol use both prior to and during pregnancy than either the NRG or CRG groups. Conclusion. The data presented provides further evidence that adjusting the T-ACE total score cut point to 3 in the TACER3 is clinically appropriate, removes nonrisk drinking women from potential intervention without missing women who are drinking at risk levels during pregnancy. Using the TACER3 criteria, only 12% of women would require intervention, while using the TACE criteria, 41% of women would score as at-risk and would require physician intervention. Increasing the total T-ACE score criterion from 2 to 3 results in fewer "false positives," reducing physician time with these patients and allowing a more intensive targeted clinical response for pregnant women correctly identified as drinking at fetal risk levels.

N2  - Ethanol exposure during pregnancy is known to alter fetal brain development through cellular apoptosis. Although there is no method of prevention, studies from us and others showed that derived peptide from activity dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) can be used as a trophic peptide for neuroprotection. In this study, we further characterize the proteomic architecture underlying the role of ADNF-9 against ethanol teratogenesis during early fetal brain development using liquid chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed from embryonic day 7 (E7) to E13 with either a 25% ethanol derived calorie (25% EDC, ALC), 25% EDC simultaneously administered ADNF-9 (ALC-ADNF-9), or pair-fed (PF) liquid diets. At E13, fetal brains were collected from 5 dams for each group. Individual brains were homogenized and the extracted proteins were then tryptically digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Label-free quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on proteomes extracted from fetal brains of all three ALC, ALCADNF- 9, and PF groups. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) score plots of the abundances of all proteins identified in the three groups were analyzed. Statistical differences in the areas and number of proteins between PF and ALC groups (137 proteins), PF and ALC-ADNF-9 groups (228 proteins), and ALC and ALC-ADNF-9 groups (23 proteins) resulted in a distinct data-clustering thus yielding obvious separation of the sample groups in the PCA score plot. The statistical analyses demonstrated significant upregulation of several proteins including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p = 0.009023), dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 1 (p = 0.009023), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (p = 0.02828), microtubule-associated protein 1B (p = 0.02828), eukaryotic translation initiation factor (p = 0.02828), histone-binding protein RBBP4 (p = 0.02828), and nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1 (p = 0.016294) in ALC-ADNF-9 group as compared to ALC group. These findings provide information about possible mechanisms underlying the effects of ADNF-9 in neuroprotection against the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure during early embryonic stage.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) exhibit long lasting behavioral impairments, such as learning disabilities, problems in executive functioning and memory deficits. Using a rat model of voluntary drinking during pregnancy, we have shown that the antagonism of histamine H3 receptors reverses fetal ethanol-induced deficits learning and dentate granule cell long-term potentiation. Given that H3 receptors inhibit neurotransmitter release, we hypothesized that fetal alcohol exposure elevates H3 receptor-mediated depression of glutamate release from perforant path nerve terminals in the dentate gyrus. In the present study, this hypothesis was examined using two different approaches. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed an average of 2.72 g/kg/ day of 5% sweetened ethanol solution throughout gestation. This level of consumption produces a mean peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. No differences in offspring birthweight or litter size were observed. In the first experiment, we examined the effects of moderate prenatal ethanol exposure on methimepip-stimulated [35S]-GTPcS binding. H3 receptor agonist-stimulated GTP binding in the dorsal dentate gyrus was significantly increased in fetal ethanol-exposed offspring. Second, we examined H3 modulation of paired-pulse plasticity, an indirect measure of neurotransmitter release, in dentate gyrus slices of prenatally exposed offspring and controls. Evoked perforant path to dentate field potentials were not affected by prenatal exposure to ethanol. Bath application of methimepip, another H3 agonist, did not affect paired pulse ratio (PPR) in control offspring, but significantly increased PPR in ethanol exposed offspring, indicating a net decrease in evoked glutamate release. Methimepip effects in the ethanol exposed group were partially reversed by concomitant application of ABT-239, a histamine H3 antagonist. Taken together, these results suggest a heightened H3 receptor-mediated modulation of glutamate release in the dentate gyrus of fetal-ethanol exposed rats. We expect that these experiments will provide insights into the mechanisms by which prenatal ethanol exposure affects synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-sensitive learning. A better understanding of this phenomenon may provide targets for therapeutic intervention in children with FASD.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and autopsy studies reveal abnormal cerebellar development in children who had been exposed to alcohol prenatally, independent of the exposure period. We previously reported that prenatal alcohol exposure during the first, third or all three trimester equivalent of human brain development reduces cerebellar Purkinje cell number in prenatal lambs. In the present study, ewes received binge paradigm alcohol exposure (3 days on, 4 days off, 1.75 g/kg administered IV as a 40% solution) during the first (E1, gestational days 4-41) or all three (E3, gestation days 4 to 132) trimester equivalent. Lambs were born, the faces were evaluated for facial dysmorphology (reported elsewhere) and they were subjected to spatial delayed alteration and classical eyeblink conditioning learning testing (reported elsewhere). Lambs were then sacrificed and whole brains and brain components were weighed and cerebellar Purkinje cells were counted utilizing unbiased stereology procedures. Purkinje cell number in E1 and E3 exposed lamb groups were significantly reduced compared to normal and saline control groups (8.7 +/- 0.4, 9.3 +/- 0.6, 14.2 +/- 1.1, 12.6 +/- 1.3 x 107 mean +/- SEM, n = 7, 8, 5, 7 respectively) . There were no significant differences in whole brain or brain component weights. Interestingly, we did not find behavioral deficits. However, a subset of facial measures obtained at birth classified alcoholexposed and non-alcohol exposed lambs wwith 72% sensitivity and 83% specificity suggesting that alcohol-induced changes in the face can predict altered neurodevelopmental development. All or part of this work was done in conjunction with the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), which is funded by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA).

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with deficits in working memory, but it is not clear how this impairment is related to the functional organization of working memory in the brain. A standard verbal n-back task was administered to 47 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) children from a prospective longitudinal cohort in Cape Town, South Africa, where there is an exceptionally high incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and related disorders. The cohort included 17 children with FAS or partial FAS (PFAS), 13 heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE), and 17 non- or light exposed controls. All but one child with FAS were right-handed. All three groups of children (M age=9.4 yr, SD=0.4; 23 boys, 24 girls) performed well on a 1-back task administered in our neuropsychological laboratory and in a Siemens 3T Allegra scanner, but only the children in the nonexposed control group performed better than chance on a 2-back task. The n-back paradigm administered in the scanner alternated between blocks of 0-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), 1-back (36 s, 12 stimuli/block), and rest (20 s). Data were analyzed in SPM8, using standard methods. Intra-group one-sample t-tests were used to identify the principal regions recruited under conditions of working memory (1-back > 0-back). Analyses were conducted in 5 regions of interest (ROIs) central to verbal working memory: dorsal prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, caudate/putamen, parietal cortex, and cerebellar crus I and II. Cluster extent thresholds were determined using AlphaSim based on 104 Monte Carlo simulations across the individual ROIs. Controls recruited left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), suggesting use of a verbal rehearsal strategy to perform the task. By comparison, the HE group recruited a broad range of fronto-striatal regions, including left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left caudate. These frontostriatal regions were not recruited by the FAS/ PFAS group, who instead relied on crus I and II within the cerebellum and parietal cortex. These findings suggest differential functional organization of the brain's basic cognitive systems in children with different forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, when compared with nonexposed controls. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that children who meet diagnostic criteria for FAS and PFAS use qualitatively different compensatory strategies to perform a simple cognitive task than those used by heavily exposed nonsyndromal children.

N2  - Eyeblink conditioning (EBC), which involves temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (a tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (an air puff), has been shown to be consistently impaired in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). A growing body of evidence suggests that white matter may be a specific target of alcohol teratogenesis. This study used DTI to examine the degree to which the fetal alcohol-related deficit in EBC may be mediated by structural impairment in the cerebellar peduncles, an important white matter component of the welldocumented EBC circuit. 13 children with FAS/PFAS and 12 matched controls (9.7 to 13.7 yr) were scanned using DTI and MPRAGE MRI sequences on a 3T MAGNETOM Allegra. A voxelwise analysis was performed on fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity images. Type I error was controlled by setting a cluster volume threshold at a voxel level significance of p < 0.01. Two EBC tasks were administered: delay, in which there was a 650ms delay between the onset of a 750 ms tone and an air puff, and trace, in which a 500ms interval occurred between the offset of a 750 ms tone and the onset of the puff. Alcohol-exposed vs. control group differences in FA and perpendicular diffusivity were identified in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. These group differences, which remained significant even after controlling for brain and cerebellar volumes, were dose-dependent. Trace conditioning was related to higher FA and lower perpendicular diffusivity in that same area of the left middle peduncle. Trends for delay conditioning were similar but fell short of statistical significance in this small sample. The standardized regression coefficient relating prenatal alcohol to trace conditioning decreased from )0.61 to )0.28 when FA was entered into a regression analysis. This decrease, which was statistically significant (t = -2.38, p < 0.05), suggests that the effect of prenatal alcohol on trace conditioning is mediated, in part, by lower FA. The effect of alcohol exposure on trace conditioning was also significantly mediated by cerebellar white matter volume but not by total brain, cerebellar, or cerebellar gray matter volume. This study extends recent findings that have used DTI to reveal microstructural deficits in white matter in children with FASD. The results suggest mediation of the fetal alcohol-related effect on EBC by deficits in cerebellar white matter volume and integrity.

N2  - Exposure of the developing fetus to alcohol during pregnancy causes a myriad of abnormalities leading to phenotypes collectively known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). A leading cause of mental retardation, FASD is a major public health problem. One of the most prominent pathologic effects of alcohol in the fetal brain is neuronal death. However, there is currently no available preventive measure for protecting developing neurons against alcohol toxicity. One of the major goals of our laboratory has been to identify agents that can prevent alcohol-induced neuronal death. We have previously demonstrated that stimulation of the cAMP pathway protects immature neurons against alcohol toxicity. Because elevated intracellular cAMP concentrations activate this pathway, agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels may protect neurons against alcohol toxicity. Rolipram is a commercially available phosphodiesterase inhibitor that blocks the degradation of cAMP specifically in neurons. We hypothesized that Rolipram can protect developing neurons against alcohol toxicity by increasing intracellular cAMP levels to stimulate the cAMP-PKACREB pathway. As a first step, using an adenoviral reporter vector, we demonstrated that rolipram stimulates the cAMP pathway in cerebellar granule neurons. We further showed that Rolipram induces phosphorylation of the CREB transcription factor, which is the downstream effector molecule of the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway. In addition, we demonstrated that cerebellar granule neurons exposed to alcohol (0 or 400 mg/dl) in vitro were protected against alcohol toxicity by rolipram (5 to 20 uM) in a dose dependent manner. Whereas alcohol killed nearly 25% of neurons, Rolipram reduced the cell death to less then 5%. These results suggest that Rolipram may ameliorate alcohol-induced neurotoxicity in the developing brain by stimulating the neuroprotective cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during gestation is responsible for a wide spectrum of symptoms in the developing fetus under the umbrella of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Defects affect the central nervous system, craniofacial structures, mental ability, and growth. However, the underlying mechanism by which ethanol (EtOH) acts during embryonic development is still poorly understood at the molecular level. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) as a model for FASD, we have previously reported (Arzumanyan et al., 2009, Ogony et al., 2010; Vadigepalli et al., 2010) that EtOH modulates the protein level of several transcription factors (TFs) during cell differentiation towards neuronal fate. Here we study the EtOH effects on the steady state level of TF transcripts during ES cell differentiation. E14Tg2a.4 ES cells were differentiated for different times in an adherent culture in a medium supplemented with retinoic acid (RA, 10nM), in the presence or absence of EtOH (100mM). Cells were characterized by morphology and staining with alkaline phosphatase, and immunocytochemistry for pluripotency-associated TFs Sox2, Nanog, Pou5f1, and markers of the three lineage layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm). We have evaluated TFs of the ES cell regulatory network and their target genes, using a novel microfluidic high throughput BioMark platform and dynamic arrays of 48.48 (assays x samples = 2304) and 96.96 (9216) real time PCR measurements. Transcript levels were quantified by the comparative Ct method and normalized to the expression of housekeeping genes. We determined the expression of markers of pluripotency and self-renewal (e.g., Sox2, Nanog, Pou5f1, Klf4, Dax1, Rex1, Esrrb), and neuroectodermal lineage related genes (e.g., Cxcl12, Nestin, Neurog, Notch, Pax6, Sox3, Sox4, Ascl1, Meis1, Zic1). Data show that during ES cell differentiation EtOH delays the downregulation of pluripotency markers like Sox2, Nanog and Pou5f1 (Oct4) and consequently perturbs the upregulation of target differentiation genes, interfering with the commitment of ES cells to neuroectodermal lineage. Our findings provide insights into the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of ES cell differentiation and may lead to a better understanding of developmental defects observed in FASD.

N2  - Increasing evidence indicates that the majority of children adversely affected by fetal alcohol exposure do not present with birth defects. Without physical signs suggestive of prenatal alcohol exposure, accurate information about maternal drinking is required for a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and to consider early interventions. This study assesses a combination of biomarkers capable of capturing different patterns of alcohol use because no single ethanol biomarker is sensitive or specific enough to reliably assess alcohol consumption. In 2009, the University of New Mexico (UNM) established a cohort study of pregnant women attending the UNM-affiliated substance abuse treatment program to evaluate validity of a broad array of maternal and fetal/newborn biomarkers. Eligible patients are screened and enrolled during one of the first prenatal care visits and are followed-up throughout pregnancy to early postpartum period. In addition to structured maternal interviews to assess quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, a broad array of biomarkers of alcohol exposure is evaluated. Biomarkers that capture recent exposure (several days to 3 weeks) include ethyl glucuronide (EtG), phosphatidylethanol (PEth), and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (%CDT). Gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) can identify more chronic exposure. In addition, some biomarkers might be useful for identifying cumulative exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, i.e., meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). Lastly, we are investigating biomarker's validity in novel media, e.g., hair analysis of EtG and FAEE, PEth in dried blood spots on a filter paper collected during the routine newborn screen. Some of the unique challenges for this prospective study include identification of subjects at the admission to the UNM hospital for labor and delivery and collection of biological samples according to the study protocol within the first 24 hours since admission. The following activities have been implemented at UNM hospital to facilitate timely collection and processing of maternal and newborn specimens: 1) intensive in-service training of the nursing personnel in research-related activities; 2) installation of an ultra-low temperature freezer at the Mother-Baby Unit to facilitate processing of meconium samples; 3) development of research orders in electronic medical records of study participants to be initiated by the nursing staff in the Labor and Delivery and Newborn Nursery units; 4) collaboration with the UNM Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) pediatric research nurses While meconium collection presents unique challenges, we were able to collect samples from n > 90% of infants born to cohort participants. Our results also indicate that 98% of the cohort participants consented to collection of scalp hair. Given the difficulties of confirming maternal drinking during pregnancy, as well as diagnosing less severe cases of FASD during the neonatal period, the development of better biomarkers, either alone or in combination with other measures, would facilitate earlier identification of affected children and allow for earlier interventions to maximize a child's long-term prognosis.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of permanent neurodevelopmental disability and affect 2-5% of live births. A major dilemma is that FASD severity varies widely even after controlling for maternal alcohol intake. The mechanism/s underlying this variance is unknown. We examined the influence of maternal iron status because gestational iron deficiency (ID) causes neurodevelopmental impairments that parallel those of FASD. Moreover, ethanol dysregulates iron homeostasis through its effects on hepcidin expression. Here we show that maternal iron status is a selective and synergistic modifier of alcohol's neurotoxicity. We used an established rat model of third trimester-equivalent binge drinking, in which pups received 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg ethanol daily from postnatal days (P) 5-9; this targeted the ethanol-sensitive brain growth spurt period. Pups were reared using iron-sufficient (IS, 100 ppm) or ID (4 ppm) diets from GD13.5 until weaning, when all received IS diets to P35, when their neurobehavior was evaluated. Whereas ID dams had largely normal iron indicators, the ID offspring were anemic and had significantly decreased iron indicators. Iron status did not affect blood ethanol levels or clearance. We found that iron status significantly impacted key diagnostics of FASD. One of these is somatic growth, which was significantly reduced by the ID+alcohol combination (p<0.001). Neurobehavioral disabilities are the most devastating outcomes of FASD; we tested a range of behaviors at P35, when iron status had normalized. Separately, ID and alcohol had little effect on behavioral outcomes. However, ID+alcohol synergized to profoundly worsen associative learning as measured using multiple tasks including short-delay and trace eyeblink classical conditioning (p=0.022), and auditory and contextural fear conditioning (p=0.008). The ID+alcohol interaction was selective because other tasks (limb grip strength, motor coordination, open field behavior) were largely unaffected by ID or alcohol singly or in combination. We evaluated brain morphology to gain insights into mechanism. At P10 ID+alcohol did not affect neuronal proliferation (phosphohistone H3) but additively increased neuronal apoptosis (caspase-3, p=0.004) within the cerebellum. The increased cerebellar apoptosis in ID+alcohol resulted, at P35, with significantly fewer of the Purkinje and interpositus neurons that mediate ECC learning, as measured using unbiased stereology. Cerebellar secondary myelination was also significantly reduced by the ID+alcohol combination, measured using immunostain for myelin basic protein. Myelination and cell survival are separately and modestly impaired by ID and alcohol; we suggest that their synergistic disruption by ID+alcohol selectively impaired associative learning. We conclude that maternal iron status is a hitherto unappreciated and potent modifier of alcohol's neurotoxicity. The findings also offer novel insights into how ID and alcohol damage the developing brain. FASD is difficult to prevent because alcoholics do not reveal their drinking behavior. These findings have significant public health implications given the high rates of alcohol abuse and ID in childbearing-age women. We propose that aggressive screening and treatment of maternal ID is a safe and clinically achievable approach to improve FASD outcomes.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which manifests itself in the form of physiological defects, mental retardation and neurobehavioural deficits, the latter of which is rarely diagnosed. Since maternal self-reports are often unreliable, a biomarker of alcohol use during pregnancy is needed to accurately determine fetal exposure and risk for FASD. While Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters (FAEEs) are current biomarkers of exposure, the introduction of a second biomarker that can be tested alongside FAEEs promises to greatly increase the sensitivity and specificity of analytical screens. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol that has been detected in the meconium, or first stool of life, of infants born to mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Whether this detected EtG was formed by the maternal liver and crossed the placenta, by the fetal liver after ethanol crossed the placenta, or by the placenta itself remains unknown. Objectives: To determine if, and to what extent EtG crosses the human placenta, and to measure placental formation and degradation of EtG. Methods: Placentae from consenting women undergoing elective Caesarian section at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario will be taken to the onsite perfusion laboratory. One mug/mL EtG will be added to the maternal reservoir and maternal and fetal samples will be taken over a 3 hour period to determine if and to what degree EtG is crossing the human placenta. EtG will be quantified using HS-SPME GCMS. Placental metabolism of ethanol to EtG and EtG to ethanol will be investigated using placental microsomes. Kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km) will also be determined to help elucidate the role of the placenta in formation and degradation of EtG. Results: To date the perfusions are being carried out and the level of EtG in the perfusate will be determined using HS-SPME GC-MS with a limit of sensitivity of 1 ng/vial. Conclusions: We have developed a HS-SPME method for detecting EtG in maternal and fetal perfusate samples. This will allow us to accurately quantify the transfer of EtG across the human placenta.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Alcohol is globally consumed, and its long term adverse effects on fetal development are well characterized. However, in utero alcohol exposure does not always result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study explores the role of ecogenetic and epigenetic factors in FASD. We hypothesize that ecogenetic and epigenetic factors determine susceptibility to FASD. Methods: To test this hypothesis we examined the prevalence of FASD between two disparate population groups; one in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada and the other in Moyo, Northern Uganda. Moyo was chosen because alcohol consumption in the district is especially widespread and yet alcohol-related behavioral and academic issues are rare. In PEI, FASD is a significant public health concern. Both Moyo and PEI are remote regions with stable populations of comparable size. Children aged 2 years to 10 years exposed in utero to alcohol as determined by maternal history were assessed by a dysmophologist/paediatrician for clinical features of FASD. Results: Fifty seven (57/87 or 65.5%) Moyo mothers and 49 (49/89 or 55%) PEI mothers admitted to consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Based on maternal history a total of 65 Moyo children and 52 PEI children were exposed in utero to alcohol. Twentysix or 40% Moyo children and 42 or 80% PEI children were confirmed to have FASD. Conclusions/Discussions: PEI children exposed in utero to alcohol are significantly more likely to have FASD than Moyo children (p<0.01). Differences in ecogenetic and epigenetic factors are postulated to be the explanation for the two-fold difference in FASD prevalence between Moyo and PEI children. These findings are preliminary and warrant further and larger studies that analyze ecogenetic and epigenetic factors that could influence risk susceptibility to FASD.

N2  - Background: The Neurobehavioral Screening Tool (NST) is a part of the National Screening Tool Kit for FASD. The NST is a parental rating scale consisting of ten questions identified by Nash et al. (2006) to be predictive of FASD based on the child's current behaviour. The purpose of this study was to field test the NST to determine how well it differentiates between children diagnosed with FASD, those with PAE but no FASD diagnosis, and typically developing controls. Methods: We administered the NST to three groups of children (6 to 17 years): 36 with FASD and 21 PAE assessed at the Glenrose Hospital FASD clinic in Edmonton, and 21 controls recruited locally. Results: Significantly more children with FASD screened positive on the NST compared to the PAE and the control group. The sensitivity of the NST in our sample was 36.1%. Within the FASD group, there was a higher sensitivity among older participants (50%) 12- 17 years, than younger participants (22%) 6-11 years. The NST had 100% specificity against the control group; none of the controls tested positively. Discussion: Despite overall low sensitivity, the specificity in our sample is very high indicating that the selected items are specific to FASD. This supports the use of the NST as a national screening tool which would lead to large numbers of children being screened and undergoing the process of diagnosis.

N2  - Background. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the strongest manifestation of FASD, results in short stature, microcephally and facial dysmorphogenesis including microphthalmia. One of the criteria for the diagnosis of FAS is the assessment of alcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to make a photo of drinking habits during pregnancy. Methods. Preliminary results of this survey are underway to 582 unselected pregnant women, of different nationalities, who refer at Department of Obstetrics Gynaecology Urology Science, Sapienza University of Rome. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered, assessing the unit of alcohol introduced by their daily habits as well as alterations of consumption during the pregnancy. Results. This study shows that before pregnancy, 68.5% consume alcohol regularly in quantities and of these 25.3% did not change their habits during pregnancy. We found that in the first trimester 33. 3% drink and 5. 6% of this intake whenever more than one drink. In the second, 35. 1% consume alcohol and 7. 5% of this intake more than one drink. Finally, in the third trimester on 37. 8% of women who drink, 3. 3% consume alcohol more than one drink. Conclusions. Most women do not know how much drinking during pregnancy is dangerous for fetus. There is currently no cure for FAS, so there is only one sure way to prevent fetal alcohol-related conditions: completely avoid the use of alcohol during pregnancy. The consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can harm the developing fetus at all stages of pregnancy. It is therefore important to have a wide program of education. And it is essential that physicians adequately sensitize women who are pregnant or intend to start.

N2  - Absorption of alcohol during gestation in human may give raise to fetal alcohol syndrome inducing facial abnormalities, growth and mental retardation and cognitive dysfunction not compensated by development. Preclinical studies so far showed that prenatal alcohol exposure impaired spatial learning in offspring, accompanied with lower activity-dependent plasticity due to deficits in excitatory amino-acid receptor function. Thus, these deficits have been related to lower synaptic hippocampus long-term potentiation but nothing is known about long-term depression (LTD). To test this hypothesis, Sprague-Dawley dams consumed 10% ethanol solution during both gestation and lactation. Experiments were performed on dorsal hippocampal slices (400 mum thick) prepared from adolescent/peri-adolescent rats (P38-P60) from the ethanol exposed, non-ethanol exposed and pairfed group. Extracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons were performed while stimuli were delivered using a bipolar stimulating electrode placed in the stratum radiatum. LTD was induced after low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 600 bursts, 10 min) and measurements were made for 120 min following plasticity induction. In CA1 hippocampal area from adolescent rats exposed pre- and postnatally to ethanol, intrinsic excitability and glutamate release were unaltered but an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-dependent LTD was facilitated. Our results demonstrate that this was due to an increased activity of NMDA receptors during stimulation that arises from (i) a deficit in Mg2+ voltage-dependent blockade and (ii) an overexpression of NR2B NMDA-receptor subunit. We also showed that this effect of ethanol on LTD facilitation was dependent upon protein synthesis. Ongoing experiments are currently analyzing the putative involvement of GABA neurotransmission. This unexpected increased in LTD may account for some cognitive deficits after in utero ethanol exposure.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) affects 0.2Y1% of the population (Sampson et al. 1997; US Department of Health and Human Services 2005). People with this disorder may demonstrate differential behavioral responses to stressful situations (Kodituwakku 2007, Hellmans 2010). As part of a series of studies on the interaction of stress and alcohol abuse, we aimed to test the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to ethanol predisposes individuals to the development of alcohol misuse following trauma exposure. Methods Used: Female C57BL/6J mice were allowed to binge drink a 10% ethanol solution for the duration of pregnancy. Six male offspring from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) litters and six male offspring from saccharin control litters were provided access to 20% ethanol solutions according to the Drinking In the Dark model described by Rhodes et al (2005) beginning at age 45-50 days. Binge drinking before and after two cycles of withdrawal were recorded. The third withdrawal cycle was coupled with exposure of the animals to a traumatic event via predator odor exposure after which binge drinking was again assessed. Summary of Results: Both PAE and control animals demonstrated a strong alcohol deprivation effect following the first withdrawal but not following the second withdrawal. Alcohol consumption increased in both groups following the traumatic exposure with the PAE animals trending toward a greater increase in drinking after trauma than the controls; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1635). Trauma-exposed mice maintained drinking levels, which is not seen after withdrawal cycles prior to trauma. There was a significant difference between the maintenance of drinking levels following the first, second and third withdrawal (with trauma) (p<0.0001) but, again, the PAE and control groups did not significantly differ from each other. Conclusions: Exposure to a traumatic event during adolescence increases binge drinking in both control and PAE C57BL/6J male mice. PAE mice show a heightened sensitivity to trauma, as evidenced by a greater increase in drinking which may reach statistical significance with a higher powered study.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Only a minority of children with heavy alcohol exposure in utero present with complete Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), yet others may suffer serious damage. We studied children with heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol to determine the prevalence of growth restriction, abnormal facies and CNS disability. Methods Used: Of 9,628 women questioned during their first prenatal appointment in Chile, 101 who consumed at least 4 drinks/day during their pregnancy were identified (exposed). Women matched for age and parity with no alcohol consumption during pregnancy formed the unexposed group (n=105). Children in both groups were evaluated for up to 8.5 years by clinicians blinded to exposure status. Not all children had data available in all three areas; partial data were included in the analysis resulting in different denominators. Statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher's exact test. Summary of Results: Of the 72 exposed children with sufficient data in all 3 areas, 4 (5.6%) were diagnosed with FAS whereas 31 (43.1%) had no abnormalities. CNS abnormalities were detected in 44.6% (33 of 74) of the exposed compared with 14.3% (12 of 84) of the unexposed children (p < 0.01). Growth restriction was present in 27.2% (25 of 92) of the exposed and 12.5% (12 of 96) of the unexposed (p = 0.02). Facial features consistent with the FAS phenotype were present in 17.3% (14 of 81) of the exposed children compared to 1.1 % (1 of 89) of the unex-posed children (p <0.01). Conclusions: In our study impaired CNS development was the most common problem, often occurring in the absence of facial or growth abnormalities. Heavy drinking during pregnancy is a serious problem and isolated neuro developmental delay may be the only sign to alert physicians to prenatal alcohol damage.

N2  - Objective: To assess the awareness and knowledge of Lebanese pregnant women about the risks of drinking during pregnancy and the factors that influence their drinking patterns. Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on a sample of 107 women consulting the gynecology outpatient department of Hotel-Dieu de France in Beirut, Lebanon, who completed the T-ACE screening test included in a 21 multiple choice questionnaire which examine knowledge and beliefs about alcohol use during pregnancy, drinking patterns and awareness of fetal alcohol exposure. Results: The 107 women of our sample were all married, between 20 and 41 years old and had mostly a high educational level (86%). Most of the women (47%) were at their first pregnancy. Of the 20 women who self-report drinking during pregnancy, 60% have obtained a positive score on the T-ACE questionnaire, which indicates that more than 11% of the women engage with potentially high risk drinking for the baby. There is not a significant difference between the different age categories or educational levels. This proportion is lower than the one found in international publications. However, the rate of excessive drinking (4 drinks or more on any one occasion in females) was higher and 1 woman in 5 reported excessive drinking in the previous year. There is a high level of knowledge that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the child, and the more consumption the more harmful and likely the effects, but there is confusion about the safety of small amounts of alcohol. 37% of the women think that there is a safe level of drinking during pregnancy; 29% tolerate up to 1 drink a month, 9% tolerate up to 1 drink a week and one woman thinks having one drink a day is safe. Women who actually drink during pregnancy are more likely to think that alcohol consumption to a certain level is safe. 31% of the women think that beer and/or wine are safe alcohols to a certain level during pregnancy. When asked about the source of this belief, 22% mention a gynecologist but the majority (61%) says it is a personal belief. 65% of the women in our sample are aware that alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to life-long disabilities in a child, such as delayed development (36%), birth defects/deformities (35%) and mental retardation (32%). However, up to 33% of the respondents report having no information about the effects of alcohol on the fetus and 2 women believe alcohol is not harmful at all. The women in our sample seem to be more aware of the necessity to stop smoking rather than stop drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Lebanese women are not fully aware of the recommendations and risks related to drinking during pregnancy, the reason why action must be taken to insure a better diffusion of these recommendations and better assessment of alcohol intake during prenatal visits.

N2  - Introduction: High alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) associated with fetal growth restriction, facial abnormalities and neurological problems. High ethanol concentrations affect the balance of apoptosis and proliferation in term placental tissue and cell lines, but effects in the fi rst trimester, the time crucial to placental development and organogenesis, are unknown. We hypothesised that placental cell turnover and amino acid transporter function are reduced after ethanol exposure. Methods: BeWo choriocarcinoma cells (n=6) were treated for 48h Scientifi c Abstracts and fi rst trimester placental explants (n=4) for 72h with ethanol (0-40mM) then assessed for cytokeratin-18 breakdown (M30) and cell proliferation (Ki67) using immunocytochemistry. Uptake of radiolabelled methylamino isobutyric acid (14C-MeAIB) and taurine (3H-taurine) were used to quantify System A and system beta transport activity. Results: Proliferation in BeWo cells was reduced by 5% with 20mM ethanol (P<0.05; Wilcoxon-signed rank). In fi rst trimester explants, cytotrophoblast proliferation decreased by 40% at 20mM (p<0.05). Ethanol had no effect on cytokeratin-18 breakdown. System beta activity was signifi cantly reduced at 10mM and 40mM ethanol in BeWo cells (p<0.05, least square linear regression). In contrast, there was a trend towards increased taurine uptake in fi rst trimester explants at 10mM (p=0.06; Wilcoxon-signed rank) but there was no signifi cant change at 20mM (p=0.1). System A activity did not signifi cantly change after treatment in either BeWo cells or fi rst trimester explants. Conclusion: These data suggest ethanol adversely affects placental development by reducing cytotrophoblast proliferation and altering uptake of taurine at concentrations mimicking moderate to high blood alcohol levels. However, the fi rst trimester tissue response to ethanol is more complex and requires further investigation. Ethanol exposure may therefore contribute to pathologies associated with FASD either by directly affecting placental growth or by indirectly altering transport of nutrients important in organogenesis.

N2  - Prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) depends on health care providers detecting maternal risk drinking in pregnancy. The T-ACE is a valid predictor of alcohol-related negative pregnancy outcome. We recently demonstrated that increasing the total T-ACE score criterion from 2 to 3 improved selectivity, identifying more non-drinking mothers and unaffected children with little loss in detection of drinkers and affected children. In this study, African American mothers (n=3008) in a longitudinal study of prenatal alcohol and child outcomes were administered the T-ACE at their first prenatal visit. Correlations were performed to identify relations between birth outcome and standard T-ACE (total score cutpoint = 2) and a new revised screen, the T-ACER3 (total score cutpoint = 3). Chi-square analyses determined improved predictive validity. Results identified significant relations between birth weight and birth length and both the T-ACE and T-ACER3 (birth weight: T-ACE = -.06; T-ACER3 = -.11; birth length: T-ACE = -.05; T-ACER3 = -.09; all p<.001) and the key craniofacial feature of FAS, palpebral fi ssure length (T-ACE = -.04, p<.04; T-ACER3 = -.08; p<.001). While both the T-ACE and the T-ACER3 significantly predicted birth size, T-ACER3 predictive ability was significantly better than the T-ACE (birth weight: chi2=11.0, p=.001; birth length chi2=6.9, p=.009; fi ssure length: chi2=6.0, p=.014). The T-ACER3, but not the standard T-ACE, was significantly related to lower gestational age (r=-.05, p<.001) and to prior pre-term delivery (r=-.10, p<.001). Finally, the T-ACER3 alone predicted lowered neonate maturity (Neurologic: r=-.07, p<.001, Physical: r=-.05, p=.003). Increasing the total score criterion from 2 to 3 in the T-ACER3 increased the screen's ability to identify negative alcohol-related birth outcomes. The more selective in-pregnancy screening of the revised T-ACER3 over the standard T-ACE can allow for more efficient Scientific Abstracts Reproductive Sciences Vol. 18, No. 4 (Supplement), March 2011 103A antenatal screening. Improved detection of fetal risk drinking affords better opportunities for intervention to reduce or eliminate maternal drinking and thereby minimize FASDs.

N2  - Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) describes the range of effects that may occur in an individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy, which include foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcoholrelated birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Information on the FASD in Australia is limited. Data from the Western Australian Birth Defects Registry showed a birth prevalence of FAS of 0.18/1,000 live births between 1980-1997, Aboriginal children being 100 times more likely than non-Aboriginal children to be diagnosed with FAS. In Australia, a prospective national surveillance study of FAS from 2001-2004 reported a birth prevalence of FAS of 0.06/1,000 live births (n = 92 cases). These rates are much lower than those reported in countries such as the USA, France and Sweden. A survey of paediatricians in Western Australia found that only 19% correctly identified the diagnostic features of FAS, which may explain the low rates. The national surveillance reported that the median age of diagnosis was 3.26 years, 40% were living with biological parents, 51% had a sibling with FAS and 65% were indigenous. The study found that one or more behavioural problems were reported in 49% of children and 28.3% were found to have emotional problems. These findings have implications for general and mental health services.

N2  - Introduction: The physical features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) include smooth philtrum, thin vermillion border, short palpebral fissures, microcephaly, and growth deficiency on weight and height. However, little is known about the specific quantities of alcohol exposure, pattern of drinking, timing of exposure, and magnitude of risk for each of these features. Methods: Using data on 992 subjects collected prospectively in California between 1978 and 2005, we examined the patterns and timing of alcohol exposure in relation to these features. Structural features were assessed by a dysmorphologist who performed a blinded physical examination of all infants. Patterns of drinking were evaluated by drinks per day, number of binge episodes, and maximum number of drinks. Timing of exposure was evaluated 0-6 weeks post-conception, 6-12 weeks postconception, second trimester, and third trimester. Results: Higher prenatal alcohol exposure in every pattern was significantly associated with the incidence of smooth philtrum but not short palpebral fissures. The strongest associations were with timing of exposure in the second half of the first trimester (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14-1.36 for average number of drinks per day; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.091.26 for maximum number of drinks in one episode), whereas there was no association with third trimester alcohol consumption. Similarly, thin vermillion border was most strongly associated with exposure in the second half of the first trimester. Findings with respect to timing of exposure were similar for microcephaly and reduced birth weight. However, reduced birth length was increased with exposure in any trimester. These associations were linear and there was no evidence of a threshold. Discussion: Reduced birth length and weight, microcephaly, smooth philtrum, and thin vermillion border are associated with specific gestational timing of prenatal alcohol exposure and are dose-related without evidence of a threshold. Women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol consumption from before conception throughout.

N2  - Introduction: The umbrella term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) encompasses a continuum of clinical presentations caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), Alcohol-related Birth Defects (ARBD), and Alcohol-related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND). In the absence of characteristic facial dysmorphia, confirmation of maternal drinking is required as a diagnostic criterion for pFAS, ARBD, and ARND. Primary prevention of FASD is often problematic due to difficulties of early identification of alcohol use among pregnant women in clinical settings given the limited reliability of maternal self-report. Methods: In this talk, I will provide an overview of the existing knowledge and results from our studies on the diagnosis of FASD and confirmation of prenatal alcohol exposure. Results: Increasing evidence indicates that the majority of children adversely affected by fetal alcohol exposure do not present with birth defects. Even in the case of full-blown FAS, recognition of more subjective physical features (i.e., smooth philtrum, long philtrum, presence of a "hockey-stick" palmar crease, and palpebral fissure length) often presents a problem for general pediatricians, as shown in our data generated from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD). The CIFASD study also identified novel ultrasound measures predictive of prenatal alcohol exposure. Confirmation of fetal alcohol exposure is problematic given that the majority of children with FASD are not diagnosed until they exhibit neurodevelopmental delays in school. Even when FASD is suspected in the newborn period, accurate confirmation of maternal drinking is difficult. Currently, interest is heightened with respect to biomarkers of alcohol exposure, analysis of direct ethanol metabolites in novel media, e.g., maternal and/or newborn hair, umbilical cord, nail clippings, and dried blood spots collected during the routine newborn genetic screening. Discussion: Early and accurate diagnosis of FASD children is a strong predictive factor against secondary disabilities such as mental health problems, disrupted school experience, delinquency and incarceration, inappropriate sexual behavior, and substance abuse problems. A battery of alcohol biomarkers, in combination with other clinical measures, can provide a unique opportunity for a point-of-care identification of pregnant women and children at risk.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CNS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. To improve FASD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, much remains to be learned from basic and clinical research. Recently, application of high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; a technique that provides for accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; a method that allows CNS fiber tract reconstruction and analyses) to an FASD mouse model has proven valuable in better defining the spectrum of dysmorpholgy that results from acute ethanol exposure during early stages of prenatal development. Using these imaging methodologies both fetal and adolescent mice have been examined, with the structural alterations resulting from maternal ethanol treatment on days 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 of pregnancy being the focus of these investigations. Stage-dependent permanent CNS damage that includes deficiency of the ventromedian forebrain, hippocampus and corpus callosum has been illustrated. Additionally, cerebro-cortical and periventricular heterotopias have been identified. The functional consequences of these defects are currently being examined. MRI has also been applied to fetal mice for analyses of ethanol-induced facial dysmorphology and has allowed identification of correspondence between the character and severity of abnormalities of the upper midface and those of the brain. Establishing that the identified brain and facial changes are consistent with those in FASD and that these defects result from insult at developmental stages that are present prior to typical human pregnancy recognition strongly supports the need for pre-pregnancy counseling and education regarding alcohol consumption. With respect to such an education-based FASD prevention effort, a middle school curriculum has been developed and distributed (http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Science/curriculum.html) and a high school curriculum is currently being completed. Each of these curricula employs a hands-on science approach and emphasizes the message that maternal alcohol use even prior to the time that most pregnancies are recognized can cause serious permanent damage to the conceptus.

N2  - The Fitzroy Valley is located ~500 km east of Broome in the remote Kim-berley region of WA, with Fitzroy Crossing town at its centre. The valley is home to ~4500 predominantly Aboriginal people belonging to 5 main language groups (Bunuba, Walmajarri/Wangkatjungka, Nyikina and Goonyandi) and living in >45 remote communities located up to 190 km from Fitzroy Crossing. In 2007, Fitzroy Valley communities were in crisis with high rates of alcohol abuse, alcohol-related harms, violence and crime. Courageous women successfully lobbied for restrictions on take-away of full strength alcohol and the subsequent health and social benefits have been well documented. Following a Women's Bush Meeting in 2008, the community identified the need to address FASD - the legacy of alcohol use in pregnancy - as a priority. In October 2008, a FASD leadership team was formed and in November 2008 they embraced a 'circle of friends' - partners in government, business and community organisations - and developed a strategy to address FASD and early life trauma. The strategy, called Marulu, includes diagnosis and prevention of FASD, community education, and support for parents and carers. Marulu is a Bunuba word meaning "precious, worth nurturing". In 2009, we were invited to help progress the strategy and conduct a FASD prevalence study called The Lililwan Project. Lililwan is a Kriol (Aboriginal English) word meaning "all the little ones". In October 2009, following extensive community consultation that confirmed this research as a priority, we formally accepted the invitation. The films Yajillarra (meaning "to dream") and Marulu will be shown and discussed. Yajillarra, which tells the story of the alcohol restrictions, was lauded when shown at the UN forum for Indigenous peoples and the Status of Women. The films were directed by Melanie Hogan, filmed by Caroline Constantine and produced by Jane Latimer.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with mental retardation and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced damage including fetal death, growth abnormalities and learning impairment in part through preventing alcohol-induced alterations in NMDA gene expressiON Given the role of cytokines and chemokines on NMDA receptors, we evaluated a panel in a model of FAS to evaluate their role and if the neuroprotective peptides NAP+SAL work through preventing these alterations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8(E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides. Embryos were harvested 24h later on gestational day 9 and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines and chemokines were measured using a microspherebased multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis,P<.05 significant. RESULTS: After 6h the chemokine KC and IL-6 levels were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median 15.7,range 10.1- 45.9pg/ml) and KC (median 45.9,range 32.5-99.1pg/ml). Embryos exposed to alcohol+NAP+SAL,had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P<.003), similar to control. Alcohol exposure resulted in elevated levels of G-CSF, treatment with NAP+SAL prevented the alcoholinduced increase (all P<.003). IL-13 and IL-1b were decreased 6h after alcohol exposure, exposure to alcohol+NAP+SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18 (10d after exposure), these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (RANTES, TNF-a, IFN-g, IL4) were not detectable at either timepoint in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL6, G-CSF and the chemokine KC which are known to affect NMDA receptors. NAP+SAL treatment prevented alcoholinduced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP+SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. We have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure decreases the expression of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT). These antioxidant enzymes are located in the brain and have promoter regions that can be genomically silenced by epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA hypermethylation. Our objective was to evaluate if the decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes in the brains of fetal mice was a function of DNA hypermethylation. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with intraperitoneal injection of saline (control) or alcohol (0.03 mL/g). Pups were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18), their brains extracted and homogenized. Each brain was analyzed individually. Real-time PCR was performed using methylation sensitive and dependent restriction enzymes to quantify methylation patterns for SOD, GPx and CAT. Data are reported as median [interquartile interval] and Mann-Whitney U was used for statistical analysis (significance: p< 0.05). RESULTS: 25 pups from 4 litters in the alcohol group and 23 pups from 5 litters in the saline group were analyzed. There was no difference in maternal or pup weight between the two groups. In utero alcohol exposure increased the percentage of DNA hypermethylation in the promoter regions of SOD compared to saline (2.89%[1.50 - 5.34] vs. 1.7%[0.79 - 2.34]; Figure. p= 0.03). No effect was seen in the GPx or CAT promoters (p = 0.94 and 0.55 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The previously characterized impaired expression of brain SOD in FAS can be due to DNA hypermethylation in the promoter region. Epigenetic modification may provide a new strategy for prevention of the long term morbidity of FAS.(Figure presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with mental retardation and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced damage in FAS including fetal death, growth abnormalities and learning impairment. Fractalkine, a chemokine constitutively expressed in neurons throughout the CNS, has a role in neuroprotection reducing neuronal death from activated microglia. Using a model of FAS we evaluated if fractalkine is altered in FAS and if the neuroprotective peptides NAP+SAL work through preventing alterations in fractalkine. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides. Embryos were harvested 24h later on gestational day 9 and 10 days later at E18. Fractalkine was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis with P P< .05 significant. RESULTS: Six hours after alcohol exposure, fractalkine levels were signficantly elevated(median 341pg/ml, range 263-424pg/ml) vs controls (median 228pg/ml, range 146-332pg/ml; P P< .001; Figure). Embryos treated with alcohol and the peptides NAP+SAL prevented the alcohol induced increase in fractalkine (median 137, range 97-255 pg/ml, P< .001). At E18 (10d after exposure), fractalkine levels were similar in all groups (medians 1821, 1852 and 2013 pg/ml respectively, P=0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in elevation of the neuroprotective chemokine fractalkine, perhaps in an effort to counter the alcohol toxicity. Treatment with the peptides NAP+SAL along with the alcohol prevents the acute increase in fractalkine.(Figure presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation. Oxygen consumption in the brain results in generation of free radicals and this effect is magnified in response to alcohol. Antioxidative enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) function to prevent the cellular damage produced by free radicals. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of prenatal alcohol on antioxidant enzyme expression. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with intraperitoneal injection of saline (control) or alcohol (0.03 mL/g). Pups were harvested on gestational day 18 (E18), their brains extracted and homogenized. Each fetal brain was analyzed individually for mRNA expression of SOD, GPx and CAT using realtime PCR with 18S for internal control. Student t test was used for statistical analysis (significance: p<0.05). RESULTS: 25 pups from 4 litters in the alcohol group and 23 pups from 5 litters in the saline group were analyzed. There was no difference in maternal or pup weight between the two groups. SOD, GPx and CAT mRNA expression was significantly lower in the alcohol group compared to controls (Figure, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure inhibits SOD, GPx and CAT expression. The reduction in these antioxidant enzymes promotes an oxidant environment and contributes to the cytotoxicity associated with FAS. The antioxidant system may be a novel pathway to target for prevention of the long term morbidity of FAS. (Graff Presented).

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes wide range of behavioral and structural deficits in children, commonly known as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Children with FAS may suffer behavioral deficits in the absence of obvious malformations. In rodents, the exposure to alcohol during gestation changes brain structures and weights of offspring. The mechanism of FAS is not completely understood. In the present study, an established rat (Long-Evans) model of FAS was used. The litter size and the weights of mothers, fetuses and placentas were examined on gestation days 18 or 20. On gestation day 18, the effects of chronic alcohol on the expression levels of integrin receptor subunits, phospholipase-C and N-cadherin were examined in the fetal cerebral cortices. Presence of alcohol in the liquid-diet reduced the consumption and decreased weights of mothers and fetuses but increased the placental weights. Expression levels of (beta1 and alpha3 integrin subunits and phospholipase-C2 were significantly altered in the fetal cerebral cortices of mothers on alcohol containing diet. Results show that alcohol consumption during pregnancy even with protein, mineral and vitamin enriched diet may affect maternal and fetal health, and alter integrin receptor signaling pathways in the fetal cerebral cortex disturbing the development of fetal brains.

T1  - Intervention for individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Treatment approaches and case management

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol in utero is considered to be the leading cause of developmental disabilities of known etiology. The most severe consequence of such exposure, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), is characterized by a distinct constellation of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation, and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Some individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) do not meet the full criteria for FAS, but instead are diagnosed with partial FAS, alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), or alcohol related birth defects (ARBD). The entire continuum of effects from PAE is increasingly being referred to under the umbrella term of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). An extensive body of research has documented major cognitive, behavioral, adaptive, social, and emotional impairments among individuals with FASDs. Although FAS was identified in the U.S. over 35 years ago, the development, evaluation, and dissemination of evidencebased interventions for individuals with FASDs have lagged behind significantly. Encouragingly, however, in recent years there has been a marked increase in efforts to design and test interventions to remediate the impairments associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This article will review treatment needs and considerations for individuals with FASDs and their families, current empirically tested treatment approaches, case management issues, and suggestions for future directions in research on the treatment of FASDs. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - The life-long neurological impairments found in people with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), including learning disabilities, impulsivity, hyperactivity, social ineptness, and poor judgment, can increase susceptibility to victimization and involvement in the criminal justice system (CJS). Individuals with FASDs become involved in the CJS as complainants, witnesses, and accused. Their disabilities, resulting from the prenatal alcohol exposure, must be considered at all stages in the legal process. Adverse experiences, such as having a dysfunctional family background, mental health problems, and substance use disorders, are compounding factors. Experiencing physical, sexual, and emotional abuse also increases the risk that these individuals will become involved in the CJS. It is critical that everyone involved in the CJS receives education and training to understand FASD and the implications for the individual offender. A comprehensive medical-legal report, prepared by professionals experienced with FASD, can help judges and lawyers understand the complex interactions among brain damage, genetics and the environment. Corrections workers and probation officers need to comprehend the significance of FASD and how it affects the offender's abilities to understand and follow rules and probation orders. Caregivers and parents need to be involved whenever possible. Early recognition of the disabilities associated with FASDs may help reduce the over-representation of this group in the CJS. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) over 35 years ago, mounting evidence about the impact of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has prompted increased attention to the link between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a constellation of developmental disabilities that are characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. These disabilities include a continuum of developmental disorders known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Longitudinal studies suggest that individuals with FASDs are at a greatly increased risk for adverse long-term outcomes, including mental health problems and poor social adjustment. This review summarizes the existing literature on mental health outcomes for individuals with PAE across the lifespan, including findings in infancy and early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence and early adulthood. Research on the psychiatric disabilities suffered by individuals with FASDs throughout development highlights the need for training of mental health professionals in the identification and the provision of specific treatments to address the unique features of this developmental disability since early identification and treatment have been demonstrated to be protective against more serious secondary disabilities. It is hoped that with greater awareness of the mental health problems experienced by individuals with FASDs, these individuals can receive appropriate and early treatment resulting in more adaptive and rewarding lives. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - The detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain include structural brain anomalies as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits. Initial neuroimaging studies of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed previous autopsy reports of overall reduction in brain volume and central nervous system (CNS) disorganization, with specific structural abnormalities of the corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate, and hippocampus. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed detection of regional increases in cortical thickness and gray matter volume along with decreased volume and disorganization of white matter in individuals with FASD. In addition, functional imaging studies have found functional and neurochemical differences in those prenatally exposed to alcohol. Behavioral alterations noted in individuals with FASD are consistent with the findings noted in the brain imaging studies. Continued neuroimaging studies are needed to further advance understanding of the neuroteratogenic effects of alcohol. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Alcohol use among women of childbearing age is a leading, preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. Although most women reduce their alcohol use upon pregnancy recognition, some women report drinking during pregnancy and others may continue to drink prior to realizing they are pregnant. These findings emphasize the need for effective prevention strategies for both pregnant and nonpregnant women who might be at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). This report reviews evidence supporting alcohol screening and brief intervention as an effective approach to reducing problem drinking and AEPs that can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. In addition, this article highlights a recent report of the National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect that describes effective interventions to reduce alcohol use and AEPs, and outlines recommendations on promoting and improving these strategies. Utilizing evidence-based alcohol screening tools and brief counseling for women at risk for an AEP and other effective population-based strategies can help achieve future alcohol-free pregnancies. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Until relatively recently these purposes have not changed and have at times been at odds with one another, resulting in collisions among policies and practices in science, medicine, public policy and the law. One area in which this has been particularly true is that of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) where the adverse consequences of consumed alcohol on children in the womb and after birth may have been observed since antiquity, but the actions taken based on such observations have been influenced as much by the socio/cultural/political context of the times in which they were made as by evidence of harm. This article provides an overview of the inherent confusion when new scientific findings confront prevailing medical practice, the history involved in this confusion with respect to FASD, including public policy and legal issues that have arisen around alcohol and pregnancy, and the research and clinical challenges still being faced.

N2  - Introduction: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, malformation of the fetus, diverse behavioural problems in newborns, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and learning disorder. Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted in Korea to investigate alcohol consumption and factors influencing drinking behaviour during pregnancy in Korean women. Therefore, a survey was conducted on pregnant women to investigate whether they drank alcohol and to identify factors predictive of drinking behaviour during pregnancy. Method: Pregnant women at less than 30 days before expected delivery who visited 3 obstetric and gynecology hospitals (a university hospital, a specialized hospital, and a clinic) were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire. Demographic (age, education, job, income, religion etc.) and obstetric characteristics (primipara or multipara, whether they wanted the pregnancy or not), and smoking history (cigarette smoking before and after the realization of pregnancy, frequency of smoking, average amount smoked and family history of smoking) were investigated, as were alcoholic history (consumption of alcohol before and after the realization of pregnancy, frequency of drinking, average amount consumed, and awareness that consuming alcohol during pregnancy is harmful). Results: 1) Six hundred and ninety five subjects of average age 30.8+/-3.8 years were enrolled. 2) One hundred forty one subjects visited to a university hospital, 496 subjects visited to a specialized clinic, and 58 subjects visited to a clinic. 3) Of these subjects, 25.7% had completed up to high school education and 37.6% had a job. 67.9% were primiparous, and 99.4% were aware that consuming alcohol during pregnancy is harmful. 4) Five hundred seventy eight (83.2%) and 173 subjects (24.9%), respectively, consumed alcohol before becoming pregnant and after they were aware of being pregnant. 5) Ninety seven (14.2% of 685 subjects) and 20 subjects (2.9% of 689 subjects), respectively, smoked before becoming pregnant and after they were aware of being pregnant. 6) Those that had consumed alcohol before becoming pregnant (chi2=107.21, p < 0.001, OR= 68.85), those that smoked before becoming pregnant (chi2=4.98, p = 0.025, OR=3.31) and those with a family history of smoking (chi2=8.06, p = 0.004, OR=2.29) were found to be more likely to drink alcohol when pregnant. Conclusion: This study shows that a quarter of pregnant Korean women aware of their status consume alcohol, and that 3 factors, alcohol drinking before becoming pregnant, cigarette smoking before becoming pregnant and family history of cigarette smoking, are predictive of drinking behaviour during pregnancy. These results strongly suggest that an anti-drinking educational strategy should be devised to target women of childbearing potential, in particular, those at high risk. (table presented).

N2  - We explored differences in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors across six groups of professionals in key position to provide primary and secondary prevention efforts (physicians, educators, correctional staff, social workers, public health nurses, and substance abuse counselors). Achieving a 60.1% response rate, 2,292 professionals returned surveys, providing data on basic knowledge of FAS, FASD-associated risks and cognitive deficits, and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women. Across groups, findings revealed ample FASD knowledge and willingness to confront and recommend treatment to alcohol-consuming pregnant women that increases as consumption becomes more frequent and severe. However, results revealed significant between-group differences data that provide valuable guidance for targeted future FASD education efforts. Public health initiatives regarding FASD have been effective in increasing knowledge among a broad range of professionals. However, between-group differences indicate the need for targeted, discipline-specific interventions. These differences highlight the need for all professional groups to provide a consistent public health message regarding maternal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can alter physical and behavioral development, leading to a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Despite warning labels, pregnant women continue to drink alcohol, creating a need to identify effective interventions to reduce the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects. Choline is an essential nutrient that influences brain and behavioral development. Recent studies indicate that choline supplementation can reduce the teratogenic effects of developmental alcohol exposure. The present study examined whether choline supplementation during prenatal ethanol treatment could mitigate the adverse effects of ethanol on behavioral development. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated with 6 g/kg/day ethanol in a binge-like manner from gestational days 5-20; pair-fed and ad libitum chow controls were included. During treatment, subjects from each group were intubated with either 250 mg/kg/day choline chloride or vehicle. Spontaneous alternation, parallel bar motor coordination, Morris water maze, and spatial working memory were assessed in male and female offspring. Subjects prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibited delayed development of spontaneous alternation behavior and deficits on the working memory version of the Morris water maze during adulthood, effects that were mitigated with prenatal choline supplementation. Neither alcohol nor choline influenced performance on the motor coordination task. These data indicate that choline supplementation during prenatal alcohol exposure may reduce the severity of fetal alcohol effects, particularly on alterations in tasks that require behavioral flexibility. These findings have important implications for children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Alcohol exposure in pregnancy is a common and modifiable risk factor for poor pregnancy and child outcomes. Alcohol exposure in pregnancy can cause a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems in the child including the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). In order to improve prevention strategies, we sought to describe the knowledge and attitudes of women of childbearing age regarding alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus. We conducted a national cross-sectional survey via computer assisted telephone interview of 1103 Australian women aged 18 to 45 years. Participants were randomly selected from the Electronic White Pages. Pregnant women were not eligible to participate. Quotas were set for age groups and a minimum of 100 participants per state to ensure a national sample reflecting the population. The questionnaire was based on a Health Canada survey with additional questions constructed by the investigators. Descriptive statistics were calculated and logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations with participants' knowledge and attitudes. Of women surveyed, 61.5% had heard about effects of alcohol on the fetus and 55.3% had heard of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Although 92.7% agreed alcohol can affect the unborn child, 16.2% did not agree that the disabilities could be lifelong. Most women agreed that pregnant women should not drink alcohol (80.2%) and 79.2% reported having negative feelings towards pregnant women drinking alcohol. Women with higher education levels were more likely to know the effects of alcohol consumption in pregnancy (adjusted OR 5.62; 95% CI 3.20 to 9.87) but education level and knowledge were not associated with attitude. There was a disjunction between knowledge and attitudes towards alcohol consumption in pregnancy. These findings will assist in developing effective health promotion campaigns to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and subsequent fetal damage.

N2  - Psychological distress (PD) includes symptoms of depression and anxiety and is associated with considerable emotional suffering, social dysfunction and, often, with problematic alcohol use. The rate of current PD among American Indian women is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of U.S. women in general. Our study aims to fill the current knowledge gap about the prevalence and characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems among American Indian mothers whose children were referred to screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data was conducted from maternal interviews of referred American Indian mothers (n = 152) and a comparison group of mothers (n = 33) from the same Plains culture tribes who participated in an NIAAA-funded epidemiology study of FASD. Referred women were from one of six Plains Indian reservation communities and one urban area who bore children suspected of having an FASD. A 6-item PD scale (PD-6, Cronbach's alpha = .86) was constructed with a summed score range of 0-12 and a cut-point of 7 indicating serious PD. Multiple statistical tests were used to examine the characteristics of PD and its association with self-reported current drinking problems. Referred and comparison mothers had an average age of 31.3 years but differed (respectively) on: education (<high school: 47.4%, 9.1%), PD-6 mean scores (3.57, 1.48), current prevalence of serious PD (19.1%, 0.0%), and a current drinking problem (31.6%, 12.1%). Among referred mothers, those with a current drinking problem had a significantly higher mean PD-6 score. Having PD, serious PD, and 2 specific scale items significantly increased the odds that a referred mother would have a current drinking problem. Psychological distress among referred mothers is significantly associated with having a self-reported drinking problem. FASD prevention requires multi-level prevention efforts that provide real opportunities for educational attainment and screening and monitoring of PD and alcohol use during the childbearing years. Mixed methods studies are needed to illuminate the social and cultural determinants at the base of the experience of PD and to identify the strengths and protective factors of unaffected peers who reside within the same communities.

N2  - In the last 40 years a vast mass of clinical, epidemiological and experimental evidence has demonstrated that alcohol is a teratogenic agent and that its consumption during gestation can cause foetal death, malformations and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in the exposed fetus. The most dramatic presentation is the complete foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is observed in children born from heavy alcohol consuming mothers. FAS and of other fetal alcohol-related effects was reported in both USA and Europe in the middle 80 s. However, despite these evidences, many European countries have largely forgotten or minimize the risks associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. Thirty years later, new epidemiological and clinical studies as well as new biomarkers of fetal-alcohol damage have identified high risk populations and have provided data demonstrating that significant number of women in the EU drink during pregnancy. In September of 2009, a conference on 'ALCOHOL AND PREGNANCY' was organized sponsored by the Swedish Presidency of the European Union, to discuss political interventions in the EU concerning this question. I briefly summarize here the discussions, presentations and the prevention programs of some European countries. The main conclusion of the conference was that we need more information and prevention programs to improve prevention of the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption during gestation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the educational effects of a single leaflet distributed once without explanation of its content. METHODS: All the 58 seniors on a dietitian course and all the 81 students who took "health and nutrition" as their elective in a women's university in F Prefecture were recruited. They were assigned to intervention or control groups. Both groups were asked the following choice questions in a baseline survey: "What do you think about alcohol drinking during pregnancy?" "What do you suppose you yourself will do in the future?" and "Do you know about the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)?" One month later, a leaflet was distributed to the intervention group only. One week after the distribution, a second questionnaire was administered to both groups. The leaflet and the two questionnaires were distributed and collected during class with the help of teaching staff. The leaflet was made by a NPO and it recommended stopping drinking when planning to become pregnant. RESULTS: The participation rate was 83%. There were no significant associations between groups and grades, current drinking habit, and learning experience on this topic. Almost 80% of the intervention group read the leaflet. Change in their thinking about drinking during pregnancy before and after the intervention did not significantly differ between the two groups. Compared to 57 controls, 66 students who received the leaflet showed significant improved changes in their attitudes toward drinking during pregnancy and the knowledge about FAS. CONCLUSIONS: No significant change in their thinking about drinking during pregnancy could be due to the fact that, even before the intervention, nearly 80% of the students thought pregnant women must abstain from alcohol entirely. This might be related to the sample characteristics, since 75% of them were majoring in nutrition. The improvement in attitudes was considered to reflect the content of the leaflet. In the intervention group, the percentage of the students who chose the alternative of "I plan to stop drinking when I wish to get pregnant" increased as the leaflet recommended and more than half of them said they learned about FAS by this leaflet. To sum up, even a single distribution of a leaflet in a school setting had educational effects which improved attitude and knowledge. Since the current sample seemed to have particular knowledge and interest in health, it is now necessary to examine effects of the same approach in the general population.

N2  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) were determined in 602 meconium samples in a maternal health evaluation study for detection of gestational alcohol consumption. A validated headspace solid phase microextraction method in combination with GC-MS was used for FAEE and the cumulative concentration of ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate with a cut-off of 500 ng/g was applied for interpretation. A new and simple method was developed and validated for quantification of EtG from 10-20 mg meconium with D 5-EtG as internal standard consisting of 30 min. extraction with methanol/water (1:1, v/v), evaporation of methanol, filtration of the aqueous solution through a cellulose filter and injection into LC-MS-MS. The limits of detection and quantification for EtG were 10 and 30 ng/g, the recovery 86.6 to 106.4% and the standard deviation of the concentrations ranged from 13% at 37 ng/g to 5% at 46,700 ng/g (N = 6). FAEE above the cut-off were found in 43 cases (7.1%) with cumulative concentrations between 507 and 22,580 ng/g and with one outlier of about 150,000 ng/g (EtG not detected). EtG was detected in 97 cases (16.3%) and concentrations between LOD and 10,200 ng/g with another outlier of 82,000 ng/g (FAEE 10,500 ng/g). Optimal agreement between the two markers was obtained with a cut-off for EtG of 274 ng/g and 547 cases with both FAEE- and EtG-negative, 33 cases with both FAEE- and EtG-positive, nine cases with FAEE-positive and EtG-negative, and seven cases with FAEE-negative and EtG-positive. Differences in physical, chemical, and biochemical properties and in the pharmacokinetic behavior are discussed as reasons for the deviating cases. In none of the 602 cases, serious alcohol consumption was reported by the mothers and no evidence for gestational ethanol exposure was observed in the medical investigation of the newborns. It is concluded that the combined use of FAEE and EtG in meconium as markers for fetal alcohol exposure essentially increases the accuracy of the interpretation and helps to avoid false positive and false-negative results. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure triggers ceramide-induced apoptosis in neural crest-derived tissues concurrent with defective cranial development
A1  - Wang G.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The reason why specific embryonic tissues are sensitive toward ethanol is not understood. We found that in neural crest-derived cell (NCC) cultures from the first branchial arch of E10 mouse embryos, incubation with ethanol increases the number of apoptotic cells by fivefold. Apoptotic cells stain intensely for ceramide, suggesting that ceramide-induced apoptosis mediates ethanol damage to NCCs. Apoptosis is reduced by incubation with CDP-choline (citicoline), a precursor for the conversion of ceramide to sphingomyelin. Consistent with NCC cultures, ethanol intubation of pregnant mice results in ceramide elevation and increased apoptosis of NCCs in vivo. Ethanol also increases the protein level of prostate apoptosis response 4 (PAR-4), a sensitizer to ceramide-induced apoptosis. Prenatal ethanol exposure is concurrent with malformation of parietal bones in 20% of embryos at day E18. Meninges, a tissue complex derived from NCCs, is disrupted and generates reduced levels of TGF-beta1, a growth factor critical for bone and brain development. Ethanol-induced apoptosis of NCCs leading to defects in the meninges may explain the simultaneous presence of cranial bone malformation and cognitive retardation in FAS. In addition, our data suggest that treatment with CDP-choline may alleviate the tissue damage caused by alcohol. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is the most severe consequence of alcohol on the fetus in the prenatal period, has been described in the French medical literature by Lemoine in 1968. Five years later, Jones and his colleagues were the first researchers to show a link between alcohol abuse by pregnant women and specific characteristics of birth defects. This work formed a basis for further research to identify diagnostic criteria. Since that time, several proposals for diagnosis have been developed, aimed at an accurate survey of a wide range of physical and behavioural anomalies resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol. The diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a real challenge. Patients after prenatal exposure to alcohol exhibit a wide range of symptoms, most of which are not specific only for prenatal intoxication and often manifest themselves in various ways throughout life. In Poland the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is sporadic and because of the lack of access to objective diagnostic tools and professional literature in Polish the diagnosis is based on the investigator's subjective assessment and the diagnoses issued in different centres may differ. As a result, many people with FASD live without a correct diagnosis or as a result of misdiagnosis (e.g. autism, ADHD, behavioural disorders, etc.) they receive improper treatment. The purpose of this publication is to present the development of diagnostic methods in the world and in Poland with particular emphasis on 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. © 2010 by Medical Communications.

N2  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are birth defects directly linked to consumption of alcohol during pregnancy and hence completely preventable. Many health and allied health professionals are in prime positions for primary prevention of FASDs through work with women of childbearing age and secondary prevention through work with affected individuals whose lives can be greatly improved via tailored intervention. Objectives To develop educational guidelines for FASD prevention. Methods Interviews were conducted with 26 individuals representing eight health or allied health professions. Participants were asked about professional groups with which they had sufficient experience to describe FASD-related competencies and educational needs for the given group(s). For each group, participants were asked for their perceptions of group members' FASD awareness, knowledge, and skills application as related to the seven core competencies for FASD practice developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results Findings revealed that competence, especially when viewed separately in terms of knowledge versus capacity for application of information, in the area of FASDs is unevenly distributed among and throughout healthcare provider groups. Conclusion Based on this information, recommendations are offered for optimal health and allied health education efforts to prevent and treat FASDs, framed along FASD core competencies recommended by the CDC. ©2010 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

T1  - Paternal genetic contribution influences fetal vulnerability to maternal alcohol consumption in a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
A1  - Sittig L.J.
A1  - Redei E.E.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol exposure causes in the offspring a collection of permanent physiological and neuropsychological deficits collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The timing and amount of exposure cannot fully explain the substantial variability among affected individuals, pointing to genetic influences that mediate fetal vulnerability. However, the aspects of vulnerability that depend on the mother, the father, or both, are not known. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) and inbred Brown Norway (BN) rat strains as well as their reciprocal crosses, we administered ethanol (E), pair-fed (PF), or control (C) diets to the pregnant dams. The dams' plasma levels of free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), free T3 (fT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured to elucidate potential differences in maternal thyroid hormonal environment, which affects specific aspects of FASD. We then compared alcohol-exposed, pair fed, and control offspring of each fetal strain on gestational day 21 (G21) to identify maternal and paternal genetic effects on bodyweight and placental weight of male and female fetuses. Conclusions: SD and BN dams exhibited different baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function. Moreover, the thyroid function of SD dams was more severely affected by alcohol consumption while that of BN dams was relatively resistant. This novel finding suggests that genetic differences in maternal thyroid function are one source of maternal genetic effects on fetal vulnerability to FASD. The fetal vulnerability to decreased bodyweight after alcohol exposure depended on the genetic contribution of both parents, not only maternal contribution as previously thought. In contrast, the effect of maternal alcohol consumption on placental weight was consistent and not strain-dependent. Interestingly, placental weight in fetuses with different paternal genetic contributions exhibited opposite responses to caloric restriction (pair feeding). In summary, these novel findings demonstrate both maternal and paternal genetic contributions to in utero vulnerability to alcohol, refining our understanding of the genetically-based heterogeneity seen in human FASD. © 2010 Sittig, Redei.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Prenatal ethanol (ETOH) exposure can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We previously showed that ETOH alters cell adhesion molecule gene expression and increases neurosphere size in fetal brain-derived neural stem cells (NSC). Here, our aim was to determine the effect of ETOH on the cell fate of NSC, premature glial-committed precursor cells (GCP), and premature neuron-committed progenitor cells (NCP). Methods: NSC, GCP, and NCP were isolated from normal second-trimester fetal human brains (n = 3) by positive selection using magnetic microbeads labeled with antibodies to CD133 (NSC), A2B5 (GCP), or PSA-NCAM (NCP). As a result of the small percentage in each brain, NSC were cultured in mitogenic media for 72 hours to produce neurospheres. The neurospheres from NSC and primary isolates of GCP and NCP were used for all experiments. Equal numbers of the 3 cell types were treated either with mitogenic media or with differentiating media, each containing 0 or 100 mM ETOH, for 120 hours. Expression of Map2a, GFAP, and O4 was determined by immunoflourescence microscopy and western blot analysis. Fluorescence intensities were quantified using Metamorph software by Molecular Devices, and the bands of western blots were quantified using densitometry. Results: ETOH in mitogenic media promoted formation of neurospheres by NSC, GCP, and NCP. Under control conditions, GCP attached and differentiated, NSC and NCP formed neurospheres that were significantly smaller in size than those in ETOH. Under differentiating conditions, Map2a expression increased significantly in NSC and GCP and reduced significantly in NCP, and GFAP expression reduced significantly in GCP and NCP, and Gal-C expression reduced significantly in all 3 cell types in the presence of ETOH compared to controls. Conclusions: This study shows that ETOH alters the cell fate of neuronal stem and progenitor cells. These alterations could contribute to the mechanism for the abnormal brain development in FASD. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: A primary goal of recent research is the development of neurobehavioral profiles that specifically define fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which may assist differential diagnosis or improve treatment. In the current study, we define a preliminary profile using neuropsychological data from a multisite study. Methods: Data were collected using a broad neurobehavioral protocol from 2 sites of a multisite study of FASD. Subjects were children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and unexposed controls. The alcohol-exposed group included children with and without fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). From 547 neuropsychological variables, 22 variables were selected for analysis based on their ability to distinguish children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls. These data were analyzed using latent profile analysis (LPA). Results: The results indicated that a 2-class model best fit the data. The resulting profile was successful at distinguishing subjects with FAS from nonexposed controls without FAS with 92% overall accuracy; 87.8% of FAS cases and 95.7% of controls were correctly classified. The same analysis was repeated with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure but without FAS and nonexposed controls with similar results. The overall accuracy was 84.7%; 68.4% of alcohol-exposed cases and 95% of controls were correctly classified. In both analyses, the profile based on neuropsychological variables was more successful at distinguishing the groups than was IQ alone. Conclusions: We used data from 2 sites of a multisite study and a broad neuropsychological test battery to determine a profile that could be used to accurately identify children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Results indicated that measures of executive function and spatial processing are especially sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can seriously harm the fetus, dependent on time, duration and frequency of exposure. The variety of outcomes is subsumed under the term >>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders<< (FASD). Diagnostic classification by means of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code results from the occurence of four key characteristics: Growth retardation, facial anomalies, CNS abnormalities (microcephaly, mental retardation, functional problems and behavioral problems) and prenatal alcohol exposure. As the facial characteristics are often discrete, the focus lies on the behavioral problems. Foster parents (most of the affected children do not stay with their biological parents) are overstrained by the everyday life with their alcohol affected children. An early diagnosis is necessary to release the foster families and to develop an appropriate concept for supporting the children according to their capabilities. Therefore a supportive network of attending pediatricians, >>Sozialpadiatrische Zentren<<, therapists and youth welfare offices with specific support for foster parents. This network aims at avoiding the adverse development and the multiple punishment of the affected children by brain dysfunction, postnatal traumatic experiences in the birth families and the danger of anew breakups of relationships due to the serious behavioral problems. Regarding pregnancy care there has to be a paradigm shift in sense of an alcohol abstinence imperative during pregnancy and early identification and treatment of (potentially) alcohol consuming pregnant women. Gynaecologists, midwives and addiction therapists are to be involved. The allover admission of alcohol consuming pregnant women respective of the later mother and child into this network is an essential. It's challenge to the whole society both to enact a specific FASD-prevention law and to establish mandatory guidelines.

N2  - Background: Number processing deficits are frequently seen in children exposed to alcohol in utero. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the neural correlates of number processing in 15 right-handed, 8- to 12-year-old children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS) and 18 right-handed, age- and gender-matched controls from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, using Proximity Judgment and Exact Addition tasks. Results: Control children activated the expected fronto-parietal network during both tasks, including the anterior horizontal intraparietal sulcus (HIPS), left posterior HIPS, left precentral sulcus, and posterior medial frontal cortex. By contrast, on the Proximity Judgment task, the exposed children recruited additional parietal pathways involving the right and left angular gyrus and posterior cingulate/precuneus, which may entail verbally mediated recitation of numbers and/or subtraction to assess relative numerical distances. During Exact Addition, the exposed children exhibited more diffuse and widespread activations, including the cerebellar vermis and cortex, which have been found to be activated in adults engaged in particularly challenging number processing problems. Conclusions: The data suggest that, whereas control children rely primarily on the fronto-parietal network identified in previous studies to mediate number processing, children with FAS/PFAS recruit a broader range of brain regions to perform these relatively simple number processing tasks. Our results are consistent with structural neuroimaging findings indicating that the parietal lobe is relatively more affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and provide the first evidence for brain activation abnormalities during number processing in children with FAS/PFAS, effects that persist even after controlling statistically for group differences in total intracranial volume and IQ.

N2  - Objective To examine the association of fetal alcohol exposure during pregnancy with child and adolescent behavioural development. Design The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study recruited 2900 pregnancies (1989-91) and the 14-year follow up was conducted between 2003 and 2006. Setting Tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth, Western Australia. Population The women in the study provided data at 18 and 34 weeks of gestation on weekly alcohol intake: no drinking, occasional drinking (up to one standard drink per week), light drinking (2-6 standard drinks per week), moderate drinking (7-10 standard drinks per week), and heavy drinking (11 or more standard drinks per week). Methods Longitudinal regression models were used to analyse the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) scores over 14 years, assessed by continuous z-scores and clinical cutoff points, after adjusting for confounders. Main outcome measure Their children were followed up at ages 2, 5, 8, 10 and 14 years. The CBCL was used to measure child behaviour. Results Light drinking and moderate drinking in the first 3 months of pregnancy were associated with child CBCL z-scores indicative of positive behaviour over 14 years after adjusting for maternal and sociodemographic characteristics. These changes in z-score indicated a clinically meaningful reduction in total, internalising and externalising behavioural problems across the 14 years of follow up. Conclusions Our findings do not implicate light-moderate consumption of alcohol in pregnancy as a risk factor in the epidemiology of child behavioural problems. © RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

N2  - Aims: To study the long-term changes of dendritic spine and synapse taking place in a mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Methods: Pregnant mice were intubated daily with ethanol (EtOH) from E5 to parturition. A DiI diolistic method was used to label dendritic spines of pyramidal cells in the visual cortex of EtOH-exposed and control pups over the period from postnatal (P) day P0 to P30; synaptic ultrastructure was also analyzed using transmission electron microscopy. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with a significant decrease in the number of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex and an increase in their mean length. The changes were dose dependent and persisted to P30. Ultrastructural changes were also observed, with decreased numbers of synaptic vesicles, narrowing of the synaptic cleft and thickening of the postsynaptic density compared to controls; ultrastructural changes also persisted to P30. Conclusions: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with longterm changes in dendritic spines and synaptic ultrastructure; these alterations probably reflect the developmental retardation of dendritic spines and synapses in visual cortex. These long-term changes are likely to contribute to lifelong mental retardation associated with childhood FASDs. © The Author 2010.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can have detrimental effects on a child's development of adaptive behaviors necessary for success in the areas of academic achievement, socialization, and self-care. Sensory processing abilities have been found to affect a child's ability to successfully perform adaptive behaviors. The current study explored whether significant differences in sensory processing abilities, adaptive behavior, and neurocognitive functioning are observed between children diagnosed with partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND), or children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol (PEA), but did not meet criteria for an FASD diagnosis. The influence of IQ on adaptive behavior as well as further exploration of the relationship between sensory processing and adaptive behavior deficits among these children was also examined. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted on some of the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) scores, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System - Second Edition (ABAS-II) scores, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition/Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Third Edition (WISC- IV/WPPSI - III) scores of 46 children between 3 and 14 years of age with pFAS, ARND, or who were PEA. Results: Greater sensory processing deficits were found in children with a diagnosis of pFAS and ARND compared to those in the PEA group. Children with an ARND diagnosis scored significantly worse on measures of adaptive behavior than the PEA group. Children with pFAS scored significantly lower than children with ARND or PEA on perceptual/performance IQ. No correlation was found between IQ scores and adaptive behaviors across the FASD diagnostic categories. A significant positive correlation was found between SSP and ABAS-II scores. Conclusions: Regardless of the diagnosis received under the FASD umbrella, functional difficulties that could not be observed using traditional measures of intelligence were found, supporting guidelines that a broad range of standardized assessments be included when screening children for FASD. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are sensitive and specific biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in pregnancy. We recently reported a 2.5% rate of FAEE positive meconium in a general population sample of infants born in the region of Grey-Bruce, Ontario. Women in this region with high-risk pregnancies are transferred to a tertiary care facility in London, Ontario. The objective of this study was to determine, in a population-based sample, whether high-risk pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of in utero alcohol exposure. Grey-Bruce residents transferred to the high-risk obstetric unit of St. Joseph's Health Care in London, Ontario were identified and consented to this anonymous prevalence study. Meconium was collected and analyzed for FAEE using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. The prevalence of FAEE positive meconium was compared with the population-based prevalence in the Grey-Bruce. Fifty meconium specimens were collected from August 1, 2006 to July 31, 2007. Fifteen (30%) specimens tested positive for FAEE. The results indicate that infants born in the high-risk obstetric unit had a 12-fold higher risk of screening positive for second and third trimester alcohol exposure compared with infants born in the general population of Grey-Bruce (relative risk = 12.04, 95% confidence interval = 6.40-22.65, Pandlt; .0001). These results suggest that the high-risk pregnancies should be screened for PAE and followed-up for potential diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. andcopy; 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to a wide range of adverse effects on a developing fetus. As a whole, these teratogenic outcomes are generally known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, the most severe of which is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Clinically, children diagnosed with FAS vary greatly in their presentation of symptoms, likely due to the amount of alcohol and timing of exposure, as well as maternal and genetic influences. All these factors play a role in determining the mechanisms through which alcohol damages a developing brain, the details of which are still largely unknown. However, continuing research and recent developments have provided promising results that may lead to screening mechanisms and treatment therapies for children with FAS. Here we review the teratogenic effects of alcohol, strategies for detecting maternal alcohol consumption, identification of fetal biological markers, and prevention methods for FAS. © 2010 S.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which includes a range of developmental deficits. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most severe form of FASD and can be diagnosed with pathognomonic facial features such as a smooth philtrum, short palpebral fissure, and thin upper vermilion. However, many children with developmental damage because of prenatal alcohol exposure exhibit none, or only a subset, of the above features, making diagnosis difficult. This study explored novel analyses to quantify the effect of a known dose of alcohol on specific facial measurements in substrains C57BL/B6J (B6J) and C57BL/6NHsd (B6N) mice. Mouse dams were provided alcohol (Alc) consisting of 4.8% (vol/vol) alcohol in a liquid diet for 16 days prepregnancy and chow and water diet during mating, and then the alcohol liquid diet was reinstated on gestational days 7 (E7) to gestational day 17 (E17). Treatment controls included a pair-fed (PF) group given matched volumes of an alcohol-free liquid diet made isocalorically and a group given ad lib access to lab chow and water (Chow). Maternal diet intake (Alc and PF), blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), embryo weights, and 15 morphometric facial measurements for E17 embryos were analyzed. B6N dams drank more alcohol during pregnancy and generated higher BAC than B6J dams. Both the Alc and PF treatments induced significant reductions in embryo weights relative to Chow in both substrains. Alcohol treatments produced significant changes, relative to controls, in 4 of the 15 facial measures for the B6N substrain but only in two measures for the B6J substrain. Discriminant analysis demonstrated successful classification of the alcohol-exposed versus nonalcohol-exposed B6N embryos, with a high sensitivity of 86%, specificity 80%, and overall classification (total correct 83%), whereas B6J mice yielded sensitivity of 80%, specificity 78%, and overall correct classification in 79%. In addition, B6N mice showed significantly more effects of pair feeding on these facial measures than did B6J mice, suggesting that the B6N substrain may be more vulnerable to nutritional stress during pregnancy. Overall, these data indicate that both B6N and B6J mice were vulnerable to alcohol but show differences in the severity and location of alcohol-induced dysmorphic facial features and may parallel findings from human studies comparing different ethnic groups. Furthermore, these findings suggest that discriminant analysis may be useful in predicting alcohol exposure in either mouse substrains. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Alcohol (ethanol) consumption during pregnancy is linked to congenital heart defects that are associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent reports have associated ethanol exposure with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Therefore, we defined whether ethanol affects Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during cardiac cell specification. Study Design: Pregnant mice on embryonic day 6.75 during gastrulation were exposed by an intraperitoneal injection to a binge-drinking dose of ethanol. Folic acid supplementation of mouse diet was tested for the prevention of ethanol-induced cardiac birth defects. Results: Acute ethanol exposure induced myocardial wall changes and atrioventricular and semilunar valve defects, which was determined by echocardiography on embryonic day 15.5. A high folate diet prevented the ethanol-induced cardiac defects. Ethanol exposure in avian embryos suppressed 2 key Wnt-modulated genes that are involved in cardiac induction; folic acid rescued normal gene expression. Conclusion: Folic acid supplementation alone or with myoinositol prevented alcohol potentiation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that allowed normal gene activation and cardiogenesis. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - The main objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of meconium analysis for fatty acid ethyl esters as a universal screening tool intended for the detection of newborns at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This will be accomplished by assessing the rate of voluntary participation in a nonanonymous neonatal screening program and by determining the logistics of implementing the necessary follow-up and interventions as part of routine care. Additionally, this study will determine the predictive value of fatty acid ethyl ester-positive meconium with regard to neurodevelopmental delays. This is an ongoing prospective cohort study. Written informed consent is sought from all Grey Bruce women delivering at participating birthing sites. Collected meconium samples are tested for fatty acid ethyl esters by headspace-solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Children with positive results are followed up through an existing public health program involving regular home visits and assessments of developmental milestones by a public health nurse. These children and matched control subjects also undergo neurodevelopmental testing at 3 and 18 months of age by a clinical psychologist using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. If delays are detected, the child is referred to diagnostic services and appropriate intervention programs. This study has been granted ethics approval and enrollment began in November 2008 at St. Joseph Health Care in London, Ontario. The first positive case has been identified and the follow-up is currently being conducted by the public health unit. The successful completing of this study will reveal the population's willingness to participate in a neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure and determine the costs, feasibility, and utility of implementing such programs in clinical practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether treatment with neuroprotective peptides to young adult mice prenatally exposed to alcohol reverses alcohol-induced learning deficits in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the mechanism involves the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and -aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, and whether it is related to glial cells. METHODS: C57Bl6/J mice were treated with alcohol (0.03 ml/g) or placebo on gestational day 8. On day 40, male mice exposed to alcohol in utero were treated daily for 10 days with D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA (n=20) or placebo (n=13); and control offspring were treated with placebo (n=46), with the treatment blinded. Learning evaluation began after 3 days using the Morris watermaze and the T-maze. The hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum were isolated. Expression of NR2A, NR2B, GABAAbeta3, GABAAalpha5, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, and glial fibrillary acidic protein was measured using calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher's protected least significant difference. Results: Treatment with D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA reversed the alcohol-induced learning deficit in both learning tests as well as the NR2A and NR2B down-regulation in the hippocampus and the up-regulation of NR2A in the cortex and NR2B in the cortex and cerebellum (all P<.05). No significant differences were found in GABAA expression. Moreover, the peptides changed activity-dependent neuroprotective protein expression in the cortex (P=.016) but not the down-regulation of VIP (P=.883), probably because the peptides are downstream from VIP. Conclusion: Alcohol-induced learning deficit was reversed and expression of NR2A and NR2B was restored in the hippocampus and cortex of young adult mice treated with D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA. Given the role of NMDA receptors in learning, this may explain in part the mechanism of prevention of alcohol-induced learning deficits by D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA. © 2010 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a challenging public health problem. Previous studies have found an association between FASD and oxidative stress. In the present study, we assessed the role of oxidative stress in ethanol-induced embryonic damage and the effect of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a powerful antioxidant extracted from green tea, on the development of FASD in a murine model.Methods: Pregnant female mice were given intraperitoneal ethanol (25%, 0.005 to 0.02 ml/g) on gestational day 8 (G8) to establish the FASD model. On G10.25, mice were sacrificed and embryos were collected and photographed to determine head length (HL), head width (HW), and crown rump length (CRL). For mice given EGCG, administration was through a feeding tube on G7 and G8 (dose: 200, 300, or 400 mg/kg/d, the total amount for a day was divided into 2 equal portions). G10.25 embryos were evaluated morphologically. Brain tissues of G9.25 embryos were used for RT-PCR and western blotting of neural marker genes and proteins and detection of oxidative stress indicators.Results: Administration of ethanol to pregnant mice on G8 led to the retardation of embryonic growth and down-regulation of neural marker genes. In addition, administration of ethanol (0.02 ml/g) led to the elevation of oxidative stress indicators [hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA)]. Administration of EGCG on G7 and G8 along with ethanol on G8 ameliorated the ethanol-induced growth retardation. Mice given EGCG (400 mg/kg/d) along with ethanol had embryo sizes and neural marker genes expression similar to the normal controls. Furthermore, EGCG (400 mg/kg on G7 and G8) inhibited the increase in H2O2 and MDA.Conclusions: In a murine model, oxidative stress appears to play an important role in ethanol-induced embryonic growth retardation. EGCG can prevent some of the embryonic injuries caused by ethanol. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Altered fetal programming because of a suboptimal in utero environment has been shown to increase susceptibility to many diseases later in life. This study examined the effect of alcohol exposure in utero on N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU)-induced mammary cancer risk during adulthood.Methods: Study 1: Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were fed a liquid diet containing 6.7% ethanol (alcohol-fed), an isocaloric liquid diet (pair-fed), or rat chow ad libitum (ad lib-fed) from day 11 to 21 of gestation. At birth, female pups were cross-fostered to ad lib-fed control dams. Adult offspring were given an I.P. injection of NMU at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Mammary glands were palpated for tumors twice a week, and rats were euthanized at 23 weeks postinjection. Study 2: To investigate the role of estradiol (E2), animals were exposed to the same in utero treatments but were not given NMU. Serum was collected during the preovulatory phase of the estrous cycle.Results: At 16 weeks postinjection, overall tumor multiplicity was greater in the offspring from the alcohol-fed group compared to the control groups, indicating a decrease in tumor latency. At study termination, 70% of all animals possessed tumors. Alcohol-exposed animals developed more malignant tumors and more estrogen receptor-alpha-negative tumors relative to the control groups. In addition, IGF-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) mRNA and protein were decreased in tumors of alcohol-exposed animals. Study 2 showed that alcohol-fed animals had significantly increased circulating E2 when compared to either control group.Conclusions: These data indicate that alcohol exposure in utero increases susceptibility to mammary tumorigenesis in adulthood and suggest that alterations in the IGF and E2 systems may play a role in the underlying mechanism. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Although the structural phenotype of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is established, prenatal exposure to alcohol may produce a broader spectrum of defects, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Documenting the full spectrum of defects associated with FASD is critical to determining the true incidence of this disorder. We examined 831 children from the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders using a structured protocol for diagnosis of FAS using the cardinal facial and growth features, and assessment of additional structural defects thought to occur more often in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects were classified as FAS, Deferred (some characteristic features of FAS), or No FAS, Groups were compared on prevalence of additional features and number of additional features observed, stratified by diagnostic category, sex, race, and age. Prevalence of most additional features was greatest among subjects with FAS and least among No FAS. A higher frequency of additional features was observed among FAS and Deferred subjects >12 years of age than among those under 12. FAS and Deferred Whites had greater frequency of additional features than Cape Colored. Prenatal alcohol exposure may produce a broad spectrum of structural defects that goes beyond FAS with implications regarding the impact of alcohol on the developing fetus, a prerequisite for ultimate prevention of FASD. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Infant symbolic play was examined in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure and socioenvironmental background and to predict which infants met criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) at 5 years. A total of 107 Cape-Colored, South African infants born to heavy drinking mothers and abstainers/light drinkers were recruited prenatally. Complexity of play, sociodemographic and psychological correlates of maternal alcohol use, and quality of parenting were assessed at 13 months, and intelligence quotient and FAS diagnosis at 5 years. The effect of drinking on spontaneous play was not significant after control for social environment. In contrast, prenatal alcohol and quality of parenting related independently to elicited play. Elicited play predicted 5-year Digit Span and was poorer in infants subsequently diagnosed with FAS/partial FAS and in nonsyndromal heavily exposed infants, compared with abstainers/light drinkers. Thus, symbolic play may provide an early indicator of risk for alcohol-related deficits. The independent effects of prenatal alcohol and quality of parenting suggest that infants whose symbolic play is adversely affected by alcohol exposure may benefit from stimulation from a responsive caregiver.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinical manifestations of FASD are highly variable and include mental retardation and developmental defects of the heart, kidney, muscle, skeleton, and craniofacial structures. Specific effects of ethanol on fetal cells include induction of apoptosis as well as inhibition of proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This complex set of responses suggests that a bioinformatics approach could clarify some of the pathways involved in these responses. Methods: In this study, the responses of fetal stem cells derived from the amniotic fluid (AFSCs) to treatment with ethanol have been examined. Large-scale transcriptome analysis of ethanol-treated AFSCs indicates that genes involved in skeletal development and ossification are up-regulated in these cells. Therefore, the effect of ethanol on osteogenic differentiation of AFSCs was studied. Results: Exposure to ethanol during the first 48 hours of an osteogenic differentiation protocol increased in vitro calcium deposition by AFSCs and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. In contrast, ethanol treatment later in the differentiation protocol (day 8) had no significant effect on the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Conclusions: These results suggest that transient exposure of AFSCs to ethanol during early differentiation enhances osteogenic differentiation of the cells.

N2  - Objective: Our objective was to evaluate whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and whether the neuroprotective effects of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-related peptides, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), are mediated through BDNF. Study Design: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40. Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization. Results: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P < .05). Pretreatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P < .05) at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P > .05). Conclusion: NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this investigation were to determine the frequencies of and associations between different neurodevelopmental disorders and to study the potential lasting effects of alcohol on children adopted from eastern Europe. METHODS: In a population-based, prospective, observational, multidisciplinary, cross-sectional, cohort study of 71 children adopted from eastern Europe, children were assessed 5 years after adoption, from pediatric, neuropsychological, and ophthalmologic perspectives. RESULTS: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, that is, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, were identified for 52% of children; FAS was found for 30%, partial FAS for 14%, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders for 9%. Alcohol-related birth defects were found for 11% of children, all of whom also were diagnosed as having FAS. Mental retardation or significant cognitive impairment was found for 23% of children, autism for 9%, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder for 51%, and developmental coordination disorder for 34%. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders were common in this long-term follow-up study of children adopted from orphanages in eastern Europe. Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has long-lasting adverse effects, causing structural, behavioral, and cognitive damage despite a radically improved environment.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Human malformations caused by alcohol consumption in pregnancy have been recognized as the fetal alcohol syndrome for almost 40 years. Prenatal exposure to ethanol is now established as causing permanent brain alterations leading to lifetime adaptive disability. Prevention approaches have not yet yielded a coherent approach to reducing harm from prenatal alcohol exposure. An important component of the Canada Northwest Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Research Network is to develop and assess research that can inform public policy. FASD prevention is a targeted goal. The Networks strategic plan for improving FASD prevention efforts has been implemented, and our progress, to date, in developing a coherent approach involves a social interventions approach, which includes: first, provision of information that might effect individual change; second, direct interactions with women deemed to be at high risk for having children with FASD; third, placement of FASD-prevention programs into a social determinant of health context; and fourth, incorporation of concepts for FASD prevention into other types of intervention programs for women who might also be at high risk for having children with FASD. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.

N2  - Background: Neurocognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in adulthood are not well documented. Questions persist regarding the extent to which there are specific, measurable effects beyond those associated with global ability deficits, whether individuals without the full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) demonstrate alcohol-related cognitive impairments, and whether observed memory effects are specific to a particular modality, i.e., verbal vs. visual/spatial domains. Methods: In this study, verbal and nonverbal selective reminding paradigms were used to assess memory function in 234 young adults (M age: 22.78, SD: 1.79). Alcohol exposure was quantified prenatally. Alcohol groups included: Individuals with physical effects of alcohol exposure (Dysmorphic group, n = 47); Exposed individuals without such effects (n = 74). Contrast groups included: Controls (n = 59) matched for ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and hospital of birth; Special Education contrast group (n = 54) included to control for disability status. Memory outcomes entailed total recall, delayed recall, and measures of encoding and retrieval, and learning over trials as indexed by slope. Results: Results indicated that Dysmorphic individuals were significantly less efficient in memory performance than Controls on all of the outcomes measured, but they did not differ from those in the Special Education contrast group. The nondysmorphic, alcohol-exposed group was intermediate in their performance, suggesting a continuum of effects of prenatal exposure. Evaluation of the encoding and retrieval aspects of memory performance indicated that learning rather than forgetting accounted for the deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Finally, no interaction was found between modality of presentation (verbal and nonverbal) and effects of alcohol exposure on memory performance. Conclusion: These findings indicate that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with persistent and specific effects on memory performance, and these problems result from less efficient encoding of information across both verbal and nonverbal modalities. Education and training efforts with this clinical group should take these characteristics into account. Copyright © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - There is increasing evidence that human pregnancy outcome can be significantly compromised by suboptimal maternal nutritional status. Poor diet results in a maternal-fetal environment in which the teratogenicity of other insults such as alcohol might be amplified. As an example, there is evidence that zinc (Zn) can interact with maternal alcohol exposure to influence the risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Studies with experimental animals have shown that the teratogenicity of alcohol is increased under conditions of Zn deficiency, whereas its teratogenicity is lessened when animals are given Zn-supplemented diets or Zn injections before the alcohol exposure. Alcohol can precipitate an acute-phase response, resulting in a subsequent increase in maternal liver metallothionein, which can sequester Zn and lead to decreased Zn transfer to the fetus. Importantly, the teratogenicity of acute alcohol exposure is reduced in metallothionein knockout mice, which can have improved Zn transfer to the conceptus relative to wild-type mice. Consistent with the above, Zn status has been reported to be low in alcoholic women at delivery. Preliminary data from two basic science and clinical nutritional studies that are ongoing as part of the international Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders support the potential role of Zn, among other nutritional factors, relative to risk for FASD. Importantly, the nutrient levels being examined in these studies are relevant to general clinical populations and represent suboptimal levels rather than severe deficiencies. These data suggest that moderate deficiencies in single nutrients can act as permissive factors for FASD, and that adequate nutritional status or intervention through supplementation may provide protection from some of the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2010 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is associated with numerous neurobehavioral alterations, as well as disabilities in a number of domains, including a high incidence of depression and anxiety disorders. Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) also alters hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function, resulting in increased responsiveness to stressors and HPA dysregulation in adulthood. Interestingly, data suggest that pre-existing HPA abnormalities may be a major contributory factor to some forms of depression, particularly when an individual is exposed to stressors later in life. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to stressors in adulthood may unmask an increased vulnerability to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in PAE animals. Methods: Male and female offspring from prenatal alcohol (PAE), pair-fed (PF), and ad libitum-fed control (C) treatment groups were tested in adulthood. Animals were exposed to 10 consecutive days of chronic mild stress (CMS), and assessed in a battery of well-validated tasks sensitive to differences in depressive- and/or anxiety-like behaviors. Results: We report here that the combination of PAE and CMS in adulthood increases depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in a sexually dimorphic manner. PAE males showed impaired hedonic responsivity (sucrose contrast test), locomotor hyperactivity (open field), and alterations in affiliative and nonaffiliative social behaviors (social interaction test) compared to control males. By contrast, PAE and, to a lesser extent, PF, females showed greater levels of "behavioral despair" in the forced swim test, and PAE females showed altered behavior in the final 5 minutes of the social interaction test compared to control females. Conclusions: These data support the possibility that stress may be a mediating or contributing factor in the psychopathologies reported in FASD populations. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Ethanol acutely inhibits ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated responses and long-term potentiation in the developing CA1 hippocampus
A1  - Puglia M.P.
A1  - Valenzuela C.F.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Developmental ethanol (EtOH) exposure damages the hippocampus, causing long-lasting alterations in learning and memory. Alterations in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity may play a role in the mechanism of action of EtOH. This signaling is fundamental for synaptogenesis, which occurs during the third trimester of human pregnancy (first 12 days of life in rats). Methods: Acute coronal brain slices were prepared from 7- to 9-day-old rats. Extracellular and patch-clamp electrophysiological recording techniques were used to characterize the acute effects of EtOH on alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor (AMPAR)- and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 hippocampal region. Results: Ethanol (40 and 80 mM) inhibited AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). EtOH (80 mM) also reduced AMPAR-mediated fEPSPs in the presence of an inhibitor of Ca2+ permeable AMPARs. The effect of 80 mM EtOH on NMDAR-mediated fEPSPs was significantly greater in the presence of Mg 2+. EtOH (80 mM) neither affected the paired-pulse ratio of AMPAR-mediated fEPSPs nor the presynaptic volley. The paired-pulse ratio of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents was not affected either, and the amplitude of these currents was inhibited to a lesser extent than that of fEPSPs. EtOH (80 mM) inhibited LTP of AMPAR-mediated fEPSPs. Conclusions: Acute EtOH exposure during the third-trimester equivalent of human pregnancy inhibits hippocampal glutamatergic transmission and LTP induction, which could alter synapse refinement and ultimately contribute to the pathophysiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibition does not restore ocular dominance plasticity in a ferret model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
A1  - Krahe T.E.

A1  - Medina A.E.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: There is growing evidence that deficits in neuronal plasticity account for some of the neurological problems observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Recently, we showed that early alcohol exposure results in a permanent impairment in visual cortex ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in a ferret model of FASD. This disruption can be reversed, however, by treating animals with a Phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 1 inhibitor long after the period of alcohol exposure. Aim: Because the mammalian brain presents different types of PDE isoforms we tested here whether inhibition of PDE type 4 also ameliorates the effects of alcohol on OD plasticity. Material and Methods: Ferrets received 3.5 g/Kg alcohol i.p. (25% in saline) or saline as control every other day between postnatal day (P) 10 to P30, which is roughly equivalent to the third trimester equivalent of human gestation. Following a prolonged alcohol-free period (10 to 15 days), ferrets had the lid of the right eye sutured closed for 4 days and were examined for ocular dominance changes at the end of the period of deprivation. Results: Using in vivo electrophysiology we show that inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram does not restore OD plasticity in alcohol-treated ferrets. Conclusion: This result suggests that contrary to PDE1, PDE4 inhibition does not play a role in the restoration of OD plasticity in the ferret model of FASD. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine exposure to alcohol may result in a distinct pattern of craniofacial abnormalities and central nervous system dysfunction, designated fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The spectrum of malformations of the brain associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy is much broader than the relatively uniform clinical phenotype of FAS. Among these malformations the most striking abnormalities involve the impairment of neuronal cell migration. However, polymicrogyria (PMG) has so far been reported only once in a human autopsy study of a child with FAS. CASE: A 16-year-old girl with confirmed maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and full phenotype of FAS presented after two generalized epileptic seizures for neurologic assessment. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral PMG in the superior frontal gyrus with asymmetric distribution. History, clinical features, and genetic investigations provided no evidence for any of the known genetic or acquired causes of PMG. Therefore, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of PMG in this patient rather than a mere coincidence. CONCLUSION: Our observation represents only the second patient of PMG in FAS and confirms the phenotypic variability of cerebral malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In patients with clinical features of FAS and neurologic deficits or seizures neuroimaging is recommended. Furthermore, FAS should be considered as a differential diagnosis for PMG. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) often demonstrate a variety of cognitive deficits, but mathematical ability seems to be particularly affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Parietal brain regions have been implicated in both functional and structural studies of mathematical ability in healthy individuals, but little is known about the brain structure underlying mathematical deficits in children with FASD. The goal of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the relationship between mathematical skill and brain white matter structure in children with FASD. Methods: Twenty-one children aged 5 to 13 years diagnosed with FASD underwent DTI on a 1.5-T MRI scanner and cognitive assessments including the Woodcock-Johnson Quantitative Concepts test. Voxel-based analysis was conducted by normalizing subject images to a template and correlating fractional anisotropy (FA) values across the brain white matter with age-standardized math scores. Results: Voxel-based analysis revealed 4 clusters with significant correlations between FA and math scores: 2 positively-correlated clusters in the left parietal region, 1 positively-correlated cluster in the left cerebellum, and 1 negatively-correlated cluster in the bilateral brainstem. Diffusion tractography identified the specific white matter tracts passing through these clusters, namely the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, left corticospinal tract and body of the corpus callosum, middle cerebellar peduncle, and bilateral projection fibers including the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule. Conclusions: These results identify 4 key regions related to mathematical ability and provide a link between brain microstructure and cognitive skills in children with FASD. Given previous findings in typically developing children and those with other abnormal conditions, our results highlight the consistent importance of the left parietal area for mathematical tasks across various populations, and also demonstrate other regions that may be specific to mathematical processing in children with FASD. © 2009 Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - The study sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of being at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) among women of child-bearing age in an urban and rural location in South Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional household survey of 1018 women aged 18-44 years in one urban (n = 606) and one rural (n = 412) site. The women were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. We defined the primary dependent variable, being at risk of having an AEP, as current alcohol use, not being pregnant, being fertile, and no effective use of contraceptives. The independent variables included demographic, substance use, health perceptions, psycho-social, and partner characteristics. The rural women (21.84%) were more likely than their urban counterparts (11.22%) to be at risk of an AEP. In multiple logistic regression analyses, significant predictors of being in the "at risk" group for the urban women were (a) being 'white' as opposed to 'black/African', and being 'coloured' as opposed to 'black/African'; and (b) current smoking. For the rural women, significant risk factors were (a) current smoking and (b) early onset of alcohol use. The significant protective factors were (a) education; (b) knowledge about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; (c) parity. Use of stricter alcohol use criteria (i.e., three or more drinks and five or more drinks per sitting) in the definition of risk of an AEP yielded slightly different patterns of significant predictors. The results revealed high levels of risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, especially amongst the rural women, and a need for location-specific prevention programmes. The high burden of AEP in South Africa calls for the establishment of national AEP prevention strategies and programmes as a matter of urgency. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: This magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM)-based report is the second in a series designed to illustrate the spectrum of craniofacial and central nervous system (CNS) dysmorphia resulting from single- and multiple-day maternal ethanol treatment. The study described in this report examined the consequences of ethanol exposure on gestational day (GD) 7 in mice, a time in development when gastrulation and neural plate development begins; corresponding to the mid- to late third week postfertilization in humans. Acute GD 7 ethanol exposure in mice has previously been shown to result in CNS defects consistent with holoprosencephaly (HPE) and craniofacial anomalies typical of those in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). MRM has facilitated further definition of the range of GD 7 ethanol-induced defects. Methods: C57Bl/6J female mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered vehicle or 2 injections of 2.9 g/kg ethanol on day 7 of pregnancy. Stage-matched control and ethanol-exposed GD 17 fetuses selected for imaging were immersion fixed in a Bouins/Prohance solution. MRM was conducted at either 7.0 Tesla (T) or 9.4 T. Resulting 29 mum isotropic spatial resolution scans were segmented and reconstructed to provide 3D images. Linear and volumetric brain measures, as well as morphological features, were compared for control and ethanol-exposed fetuses. Following MRM, selected specimens were processed for routine histology and light microscopic examination. Results: Gestational day 7 ethanol exposure resulted in a spectrum of median facial and forebrain deficiencies, as expected. This range of abnormalities falls within the HPE spectrum; a spectrum for which facial dysmorphology is consistent with and typically is predictive of that of the forebrain. In addition, other defects including median facial cleft, cleft palate, micrognathia, pituitary agenesis, and third ventricular dilatation were identified. MRM analyses also revealed cerebral cortical dysplasia/heterotopias resulting from this acute, early insult and facilitated a subsequent focused histological investigation of these defects. Conclusions: Individual MRM scans and 3D reconstructions of fetal mouse brains have facilitated demonstration of a broad range of GD 7 ethanol-induced morphological abnormality. These results, including the discovery of cerebral cortical heterotopias, elucidate the teratogenic potential of ethanol insult during the third week of human prenatal development. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters adult neurogenesis and the neurogenic response to stress in male rats. As the effects of stress on neurogenesis are sexually dimorphic, the present study investigated the effects of PAE on adult hippocampal neurogenesis under both nonstressed and stressed conditions in female rats. Pregnant females were assigned to one of three prenatal treatments: (1) alcohol (PAE)-liquid alcohol (ethanol) diet ad libitum (36% ethanol-derived calories); (2) pair-fed-isocaloric liquid diet, with maltose-dextrin substituted for ethanol, in the amount consumed by a PAE partner (g/kg body wt/day of gestation); and (3) control-lab chow ad libitum. Female offspring were assigned to either nonstressed (undisturbed) or stressed (repeated restraint stress for 9 days) conditions. On day 10, all rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and perfused either 24 hours (cell proliferation) or 3 weeks (cell survival) later. We found that PAE did not significantly alter cell proliferation or survival, whereas females from the pair-fed condition exhibited elevated levels of cell survival compared to control females. Importantly, however, the proportion of both new neurons and new glial cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was reduced in PAE compared to control females. Exposure to stress did not alter neurogenesis in any of the prenatal treatment groups. In summary, compared to females from the control condition, prenatal dietary restriction enhanced the survival of new neurons, whereas PAE altered the differentiation of newly produced cells in the adult dentate gyrus. Alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis following PAE may contribute to learning and memory deficits seen in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common nongenetic cause of mental retardation and is characterized by neurodevelopmental anomalies. C-fos is a cellular marker of transcriptional activity in the stress-signal pathway. Previously, we showed the treatment with NAP (NAPVSIPQ)+SAL (SALLRSIPA) reversed the learning deficit after prenatal alcohol exposure in FAS. Our objective was to evaluate if the mechanism of actions of NAP+SAL involves the stress-signal pathway differentiating c-fos expression in mouse brains after prenatal alcohol exposure. C57Bl6/J mice were treated with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or placebo on gestational day 8. On postnatal day 40, in utero alcohol-exposed males were treated via gavage with 40 mug D-NAP and 40 mug D-SAL (n=6) or placebo (n=4); controls were gavaged with placebo daily (n=12). After learning evaluation, hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex were isolated. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were performed. Statistics included analysis of variance and post hoc Fisher analysis. Adult treatment with NAP+SAL restored the down-regulation of c-fos in the hippocampus after prenatal alcohol exposure (p<0.05), but not in the cerebellum. There was no difference in c-fos expression in the cortex. Adult treatment with NAP+SAL restored the down-regulation of c-fos expression in hippocampus attenuating the alcohol-induced alteration of the stress-signal pathway.

N2  - The present experiment assessed motor response programming and movement time in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PEA). Alcohol-exposed children between the ages of 7 and 17 years were classified into two groups: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS: n=9) and children with PEA (PEA: n=19) but who did not have the defining characteristics of FAS. The FAS and PEA children were compared with non-alcohol-exposed children (NC: n=23) when completing two tasks: a simple reaction time task (RT alone condition) and a reaction plus movement task (RT. +. Move condition). The movement involved responding to an imperative stimulus signal and depressing three target buttons in a set sequence. Participants completed 24 trials each for the RT alone and RT. +. Move response conditions. Results indicated no significant differences in performance among FAS, PEA, and NC groups during the RT alone condition. However, during the RT. +. Move condition, the FAS group produced significantly longer and more variable RTs than the PEA and NC groups, which produced comparable RTs. The FAS group also produced significantly slower movement times when moving to all three targets, whereas movement time variability did not significantly differ as a function of group. The observed results indicate children with FAS experience deficits in response programming and movement time production. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - We previously demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure results in brain defects at different embryonic stages. This study is aimed at characterizing the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure on the levels of several neurotransmitters at early embryonic stage 13 (E13). Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to either a 25% ethanol derived calorie diet (ALC) or pair-fed (PF) liquid diet from E7 to E13. At E13, fetal brains were collected from dams of the ALC and PF groups. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was then used to evaluate neurotransmitter levels. This approach involved the use of an LC column in conjunction with multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Quantitative analyses of catecholamines, idolamine, and amino acid neurotransmitters revealed significant reductions in the levels of dopamine (p=0.004), norepinephrine (p=0.0009), epinephrine (p=0.0002), serotonin (p=0.004), and GABA (p=0.002) in the ALC group compared to the PF group. However, there was no significant change in the levels of glutamate in E13 fetal brains. These findings demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure reduces the concentrations of some catecholamines, idolamine, and amino acid neurotransmitters in E13 fetal brains. This study suggests that alterations of selective neurotransmitters may be the cause of abnormalities in brain function and behavior found in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2010 ISDN.

N2  - Directional asymmetry, the systematic differences between the left and right body sides, is widespread in human populations. Changes in directional asymmetry are associated with various disorders that affect craniofacial development. Because facial dysmorphology is a key criterion for diagnosing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the question arises whether in utero alcohol exposure alters directional asymmetry in the face. Data on the relative position of 17 morphologic landmarks were obtained from facial scans of children who were classified as either FAS or control. Shape data obtained from the landmarks were analyzed with the methods of geometric morphometrics. Our analyses showed significant directional asymmetry of facial shape, consisting primarily of a shift of midline landmarks to the right and a displacement of the landmarks around the eyes to the left. The asymmetry of FAS and control groups differed significantly and average directional asymmetry was increased in those individuals exposed to alcohol in utero. These results suggest that the developmental consequences of fetal alcohol exposure affect a wide range of craniofacial features in addition to those generally recognized and used for diagnosis of FAS. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading preventable causes of developmental disabilities with serious permanent consequences. Regardless of the increased awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 13% of women in the United States drink alcohol during pregnancy. Health care professionals do not routinely assess the frequency and quantity of alcohol use by their patients. This study examined the knowledge, skills, and practices of family medicine residency and clerkship directors and assessed the time devoted and format of FAS curricula in the programs. A self-administered anonymous survey was sent to the residency and clerkship directors (N=571). Response rate of clerkship directors was 52% and residency directors 46%. Both groups showed high level of knowledge of FASD and of alcohol counseling practices for pregnant women. Although almost two thirds of the residency programs had FASD integrated in the curriculum, an equivalent fraction of predoctoral programs did not. More than half of the clerkship directors without FASD in their curriculum agreed that a need exists for its inclusion. These findings raise important medical education and policy issues and provide insight into the disparity in FASD content of curricula between predoctoral and family medicine residency programs in the United States. The role of physician counseling in primary prevention of FAS should continue to be stressed in predoctoral and residency education. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Many children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy cannot be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We conducted a preliminary investigation to determine whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene expression may have some utility as a diagnostic indicator of maternal drinking during pregnancy and as a prognostic indicator of risk for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in affected offspring. Pregnant Long-Evans rats voluntarily consumed either a 0 or 5% ethanol solution 4 h each day throughout gestation. Ethanol consumption produced a mean maternal daily intermittent peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. Placentas were harvested on gestational day 20 for gene expression studies. Microarray analysis of more than 28,000 genes revealed that the expression of 304 known genes was altered twofold or greater in placenta from ethanol-consuming dams compared with controls. About 76% of these genes were repressed in ethanol-exposed placentas. Gene expression changes involved proteins associated with central nervous system development; organ morphogenesis; immunological responses; endocrine function; ion homeostasis; and skeletal, cardiovascular, and cartilage development. To date, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis has confirmed significant alterations in gene expression for 22 genes, including genes encoding for three calcium binding proteins, two matrix metalloproteinases, the cannabinoid 1, galanin 2 and toll-like receptor 4, iodothyronine deiodinase 2, 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, placental growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, gremlin 1, and epithelial growth factor (EGF)-containing extracellular matrix protein. These results suggest that the expression of a sufficiently large number of placental mRNAs is altered after moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of the placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD. Furthermore, these results provide new insights into novel mechanisms on how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate its teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function during pregnancy. © 2010.

N2  - Preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) requires detection of in-pregnancy maternal risk drinking. The widely used T-ACE screen has been applied in various ways, although the impact of those different uses on effectiveness is uncertain. We examined relations among different T-ACE scoring criteria, maternal drinking, and child outcome. Self-reported across-pregnancy maternal drinking was assessed in 75 African-American women. The different T-ACE criteria used varied the level of drinking that defined tolerance (two or three drinks) and the total T-ACE score cut-points (two or three). Receiver operator curves and regression analysis assessed the significance of relations. Increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point to 3 almost doubled specificity in detecting risk drinking whereas maintaining adequate sensitivity, equivalent to that in the original report, and identified substantially more neurobehavioral deficits in children. Redefining tolerance at three drinks did not improve T-ACE effectiveness in predicting outcomes. This study is among the first to show the ability of an in-pregnancy T-ACE assessment to predict child neurodevelopmental outcome. In addition, increasing the total T-ACE score criterion (from 2 to 3) improved identification of non-drinking mothers and unaffected children with little loss in detection of drinkers and affected children. Efficient in-pregnancy screens for risk drinking afford greater opportunities for intervention that could prevent/limit FASDs. andcopy; 2010.

N2  - Detecting patterns of maternal drinking that place fetuses at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is critical to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention but is challenging because information on antenatal drinking collected during pregnancy is often insufficient or lacking. Although retrospective assessments have been considered less favored by many researchers due to presumed poor reliability, this perception may be inaccurate because of reduced maternal denial and/or distortion. The present study hypothesized that fetal alcohol exposure, as assessed retrospectively during child adolescence, would be related significantly to prior measures of maternal drinking and would predict alcohol-related behavioral problems in teens better than antenatal measures of maternal alcohol consumption. Drinking was assessed during pregnancy, and retrospectively about the same pregnancy, at a 14-year follow-up in 288 African-American women using well-validated semistructured interviews. Regression analysis examined the predictive validity of both drinking assessments on pregnancy outcomes and on teacher-reported teen behavior outcomes. Retrospective maternal self-reported drinking assessed 14 years postpartum was significantly higher than antenatal reports of consumption. Retrospective report identified 10.8 times more women as risk drinkers (andge; one drink per day) than the antenatal report. Antenatal and retrospective reports were moderately correlated and both were correlated with the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy based on retrospective report identified significantly more teens exposed prenatally to at-risk alcohol levels than antenatal, in-pregnancy reports. Retrospective report predicted more teen behavior problems (e.g., attention problems and externalizing behaviors) than the antenatal report. Antenatal report predicted younger gestational age at birth and retrospective report predicted smaller birth size; neither predicted teen IQ. These results suggest that if only antenatal, in-pregnancy maternal report is used, then a substantial proportion of children exposed prenatally to risk levels of alcohol might be misclassified. The validity of retrospective assessment of prior drinking during pregnancy as a more effective indicator of prenatal exposure was established by predicting more behavioral problems in teens than antenatal report. Retrospective report can provide valid information about drinking during a prior pregnancy and may facilitate diagnosis and subsequent interventions by educators, social service personnel, and health-care providers, thereby reducing the life-long impact of FASDs. andcopy; 2010 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Can prenatal screening for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder be justified? A commentary
A1  - Mizejewski G.J.
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading cause of non-genetic mental retardation in the USA, possibly exceeding even Down syndrome, which is currently approaching 1 in 500 live births. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in brain, craniofacial and heart defects, neurotoxicity, and immune dysfunction. The preferred action taken to prevent alcohol consumption during pregnancy is abstinence. However, the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD remain a major public health need in this country and throughout the world. The biochemical molecules involved in the developmental anomalities encompass a vast array of signal transduction and synaptic pathways which involve neurotransmitters and neurotrophic peptides. Recent advances in medicine-based therapies for FASD have been reported, and include the use of small molecule agonists, antagonists, and competitive inhibitors. Since biomarkers for FASD have previously been identified in clinical research reports, multicenter screening feasibility studies now seem warranted and could be initiated following adequate funding, protocols, procedures, and institutional review board approvals. © 2009 S.

N2  - This ongoing collaborative study investigates the nutrient and oxidative stress status of alcohol-exposed Ukrainian pregnant women and whether micronutrient supplementation with and without choline, a nutrient critical for brain development, will reduce Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in the offspring. Analysis to date of maternal baseline plasma samples shows that alcohol-exposed women (N=49) had lower Zn and Cu concentrations, and Total Radical-trapping Antioxidant Potential (TRAP) vs. controls (N=40). There were no differences in Fe, ferritin, Mg, Ca, or ceruloplasmin activity. Methyl-donor nutrients (choline, betaine, DMG, folate, Vit B12, and homocysteine), Vit A, E and select carotenoids, and oxidative stress (TBARS, protein carbonyls) and inflammation (hsCRP) indices were similar. Absolute oz. of alcohol/drinking day during the 2 wks prior to interview was associated with higher Vit A and ferritin, and lower Vit B12. The low Zn, Cu and Vit B12 in ethanol-exposed women may contribute to adverse fetal development. It has been reported that alcohol increases body Fe stores, which can lead to oxidative stress. In our study, alcohol intake was associated with increased ferritin in pregnant women, which, when coupled with lower TRAP, may increase oxidative stress-induced teratogenesis. These data will be updated as sample size requirements are met.

N2  - Purpose: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) include growth deficiency, birth defects, and neurobehavioral impairment, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100 live births. An ongoing study investigates whether nutritional inadequacies of alcohol-exposed Ukrainian pregnant women amplify alcohol teratogenicity, and whether micronutrient supplementation with and without choline, a nutrient critical for brain development, will reduce FASD in the offspring. Methods: As part of an international collaborative study on FASD, pregnant women in Ukraine who report moderate to heavy alcohol use in early pregnancy, or no or low amounts of alcohol (controls), are prospectively recruited. Women are then randomly assigned to receive micronutrient supplementation, with and without choline, or no supplementation. At enrollment, and at 32 weeks gestation, blood is collected and analyzed for vitamin, mineral and oxidative stress status. Results: Analysis to date of maternal baseline (gestational age: 20.6 +/- 0.7 weeks) plasma samples shows that alcohol-exposed women (n = 49) had lower Zn and Cu concentrations, and Total Radical-trapping Antioxidant Potential (TRAP) than controls (n = 40). Concentrations of iron, ferritin, magnesium and calcium, and ceruloplasmin activity were similar between groups. There was no difference in concentrations of methyl-donor nutrients (choline, betaine, DMG, folate, Vitamin B12, and homocysteine), or Vitamins A, E and select carotenoids. Indices of oxidative stress (TBARS, protein carbonyls) and inflammation (hsCRP) were also similar. Absolute oz. of alcohol/drinking day during the 2 weeks prior to interview was associated with higher Vitamin A and ferritin, and lower Vitamin B12. Conclusion: Low Vitamin B12 status in ethanol-exposed women may contribute to adverse fetal development. It has been reported that alcohol increases body Fe stores, which can lead to oxidative stress. In our study, alcohol intake was associated with increased ferritin. This, coupled with the compromised Zn and Cu status, and the lower antioxidant capacity of the blood (TRAP) observed in alcohol-exposed women may increase alcohol-induced oxidative damage and potentiate alcohol teratogenicity. This continuing study will determine whether maternal nutrient status, before and after micronutrient supplementation, can modulate the risk for FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts physical, neurological, and behavioral development, leading to a range of effects referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The outcome among children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy varies widely and some of this variation may be due to nutritional factors. We have been examining the effects of manipulating levels of choline, a nutrient that is essential for brain development and function, on alcohol's teratogenic effects. Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed diets containing either 40% or 100% recommended choline levels throughout pregnancy. Subjects were exposed to 6.0 g/kg/day ethanol from gestational days 5-20 via intubation; pair-fed and ad lib chow controls were included. The moderate choline deficiency exacerbated ethanol's adverse effects on physical and behavioral development, including deficit in hind-limb coordination and overactivity in the open field. In contrast, choline supplementation (250 mg/kg/day) during prenatal alcohol exposure (6.0 g/kg/day) reduces the severity of alcohol-induced body weight deficits, physical defects and deficits in psychomotor and cognitive development. Moreover, choline supplementation during the postnatal period, after alcohol exposure has ceased, can reduce the severity of alcohol-induced overactivity in the open field as well as alcohol-induced deficits on a variety of learning and memory, including working memory, spatial memory, reversal learning, and trace Pavlovian conditioning. These findings suggest that choline may still be effective even after the alcohol-related damage is complete. In sum, these data indicate that even moderate suboptimal nutritional status may exacerbate some of ethanol's teratogenic effects, a finding with important implications for the prevention of FASD. Moreover, these data indicate that choline supplementation, either during prenatal or postnatal development, may serve as an effective treatment for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Central nervous system development and function requires vitamin A (retinol). Retinol has no known activity itself; rather, its metabolite all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) supports most of its biological functions. atRA initiates neurogenesis and dendritic growth in the hippocampus and is required for spatial memory. Super-physiological atRA inhibits neurogenesis and alters cognitive function and behavior. Because abnormal atRA shares pathologies with alcoholism, inhibition of retinol activation into atRA has been credited as contributing to ethanol toxicity, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo by rigorous analysis of atRA during normal vitamin A nutriture. We developed robust analytical techniques, based on LC/MS/MS, to quantify atRA and determine the effects of ethanol. In no instance did ethanol decrease physiological atRA levels in vivo during normal vitamin A nutriture in the tissues analyzed (serum, liver, brain, testis, kidney). Ethanol either increased or had no effect on atRA, despite changes in retinol and retinyl esters (RE), i.e., ethanol caused widespread changes in RE and retinol, but tissue/region specific increases in atRA. Postnatally, ethanol produced large atRA increases in hippocampus and testis, areas sensitive to both ethanol exposure and increased atRA. One-month feeding a liquid diet with 6.5% ethanol (Lieber-DeCarli diet) increased atRA in adult hippocampus (20-fold), cortex (2-fold) and serum (10-fold). Feeding dams the Lieber-DeCarli diet from e13-e18 increased atRA in fetal hippocampus (1.5 to 20-fold) and cortex (2 to 50-fold), depending on blood alcohol content. Tissue-specific increases in retinoid dehydrogenase mRNAs and activities, extra-hepatic retinol concentrations, and atRA catabolism, combined to produce site-specific effects. The ethanol-induced atRA increases in fetal hippocampus and cortex extend beyond the range reported to cause phenotypic changes. Prenatal ethanol exposure, similar to the exposure used here, has been reported to decrease the number of dendritic spines and their length in mouse hippocampus, and causes abnormal architecture in rat hippocampus. Thus, our data of ethanol-induced atRA increases at selective sites in the developing brain, and the literature concluding that increasing atRA modestly causes pathological consequences, suggest that ethanol-induced superphysiological atRA concentrations contributes to ethanol's pathology, including cognitive dysfunction and fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Prevention of alcohol use is difficult thus therapies that ameliorate alcohol's damage are desirable. The severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) increases with parity, implying the depletion of a protective maternal factor, perhaps a nutrient. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in women and causes neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring that parallel FASD. We hypothesized that moderate maternal iron inadequacy (ID) potentiates alcohol's effects upon the developing brain and tested this in rat pups reared on dams fed iron-sufficient (IS) or ID diets. We exposed pups to 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg/day alcohol during the brain growth spurt period via gastric gavage (postnatal days 4-9; P4-9). ID dams had subclinical iron deficiency and were not anemic; their liver iron stores were depleted. In the offspring, ID amplified the reduction of body growth caused by alcohol exposure. At P10, ID pups were anemic, and they had significantly more apoptosis in the cerebellum than did either alcohol-exposed or ID pups separately. During adolescence, the ID-alcohol combination did not affect a select set of neurobehavioral skills involving motor coordination. However, the ID-alcohol combination significantly exacerbated the alcohol-induced deficits of associative learning, measured using delay eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC), a cerebellumdependent task. Their values for conditioned response frequency and amplitude were ~30% of the responses in ID-only or alcohol-only animals. The ID-alcohol combination also significantly impaired outcomes in a second test of associative learning, contextual fear conditioning. This is the first study to show that maternal iron inadequacy profoundly exacerbates alcohol's teratogenicity and its impact upon behavioral outcomes. We propose that maternal iron status is an important modulator of fetal neurobehavioral outcome following alcohol exposure.

N2  - Alcohol drinking during pregnancy is the cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Variability of the outcome of infants exposed to similar amounts of ethanol in utero remains an unresolved issue. Similarities between patients with FASD and patients with mutations in L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1) implicate L1 as a target for ethanol. Several studies have addressed this hypothesis. Our laboratory has shown that (i) ethanol inhibits L1-mediated neurite outgrowth with an IC50 of 3-5 mM; (ii) that downstream signaling of L1 is inhibited by ethanol; and (iii) that the proximal downstream signaling interaction is with p60src. Both L1 and p60src have been described in lipid rafts, specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane enriched in phosphatidylcholine and GM1 ganglioside. Recently we have found that pharmacologic concentrations of ethanol increase the proportion of L1 present in lipid rafts in cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and in an in vivo rat pup model. These results suggest that altered trafficking of L1 through lipid rafts may underlie ethanol's effects on L1 mediated neurite outgrowth. We propose that interventions that normalize L1 trafficking through lipid rafts would minimize ethanol's impact. Namely that choline and GM1 ganglioside supplementation would reduce ethanol's effects on L1 - lipid raft interactions. We further propose that maternal choline and GM1 ganglioside nutritional status may play a role in the severity of fetal outcome. According to this hypothesis, our recent data demonstrate that supplementation of CGN with choline and GM1 ganglioside (C/GM1) reduces the redistribution of L1 to lipid rafts and prevents the inhibition of L1 downstream signaIing. Further, we have shown that C/GM1 supplementation is required for 18 hour to be effective. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ethanol's effects on L1 distribution in lipid rafts underlie the inhibitory effects of ethanol on L1 function and can be ameliorated by maternal choline and GM1 ganglioside nutritional status.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the most important consequences are neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Education has not reduced the incidence of FASD leading to a growing interest in understanding the mechanisms of action for the purpose of developing therapeutic prevention or mitigation strategies. Based on the observation that maternal ethanol consumption reduces maternal and fetal pH, we hypothesized that a pH-sensitive pathway involving the TWIK-related acid sensitive potassium channels (TASKs) is implicated in ethanol-induced injury to the fetal cerebellum, one of the most sensitive targets of prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant sheep received alcohol intravenously (258+/-10 mg/dl peak blood ethanol concentration) or saline in a "3 days/week binge" pattern throughout the third trimester. Quantitative stereological analysis demonstrated that alcohol resulted in a 45% reduction in the total number of fetal cerebellar Purkinje cells, the cell type most sensitive to developmental alcohol exposure. Extracellular pH manipulation to create the same degree and pattern of pH fall caused by ethanol (manipulations large enough to inhibit TASK 1 channels), resulted in a 24% decrease in Purkinje cell number. We determined immunohistochemically that TASK 1 channels are expressed in Purkinje cells and that the TASK 3 isoform is expressed in granule cells of the ovine fetal cerebellum. Pharmacological blockade of both TASK 1 and TASK 3 channels simultaneous with alcohol effectively prevented any reduction in fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell number. We have also demonstrated that alcohol exposure causes both maternal and fetal compartment alterations in plasma amino acid concentrations including glutamine. Glutamine is important in maternal pH homeostasis, the regulation of apoptosis and reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species. These results demonstrate the functional significance of fetal cerebellar two pore domain pH-sensitive channels and establishes them as a potential therapeutic target for prevention of alcohol teratogenesis and raises the possibility that glutamine may provide a nutritional/nutriceutical approach to affect the actions of these channels and or defend maternal pH to protect the fetus.

N2  - The Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD) comprises clinical and basic scientists who collectively aim to expand knowledge about fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). One goal of the CIFASD is the development of neurobehavioral profiles that specifically define FASD, which may assist differential diagnosis or improve treatment. A second goal is to combine data collected using multiple methodologies across multiple sites. This presentation will include 2 analyses. The first focuses on the neurobehavioral profile, and the second on the relation of this profile to measures of dysmorphology. Data were collected using a broad neurobehavioral protocol and dysmorphology examination. Subjects were children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and children with unexposed controls. The alcohol-exposed group included children with and with out fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). For the first analysis, data were analyzed using latent profile analysis (LPA). Twenty-two variables were selected from over 500 neuropsychological variables, based on their ability to distinguish children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls. The resulting profile was successful at distinguishing subjects with FAS from nonexposed controls without FAS with 92% overall accuracy; 87.8% of FAS cases and 95.7% of controls were correctly classified. The same analysis was repeated with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure but without FAS and non-exposed controls with similar results. The overall accuracy was 84.7%; 68.4% of alcohol-exposed cases and 95% of controls were correctly classified. In the second analyses, these neurobehavioral variables were correlated with measures of dysmorphology. Results revealed significant correlations between measures of neurobehavioral function and dysmorphology. Results of these combined analyses will be discussed.

Approximately 40,000 infants in the United States are born with FASD per year, costing an estimated $6 billion in health, education, and social services. Ethanol is the main constituent of consumable alcohol and is the addictive neuroactive compound that causes FASD. However, therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of FASD are not available. While prenatal ethanol exposure affects development of almost all organs, the brain and craniofacial features show the most severe defects. The cerebellum is particularly sensitive to the effects of ethanol during development. Our studies have demonstrated that high dose of ethanol (blood ethanol concentration 80 mM) induces apoptosis in the external granule layer of cerebellum, and inhibits the differentiation and reduces the survival of cerebellar granule cells. At this concentration, ethanol also increases oxidative stress in the cerebellum and in cerebellar granule cells. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin polyphenolic compound found in various plants, including grapes, berries and peanuts. It exhibits a wide range of pharmacological effects, including prevention of heart disorders, blocking of lipoprotein oxidation, free radical scavenging, prevention of apoptosis, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. It mimics caloric restriction by extending the lifespan of different organisms via activation of deacetylases from the sirtuin family. Recent studies have shown that resveratrol exhibits neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress. Using a rodent model of FASD we further demonstrate that resveratrol prevents ethanol-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in the external granule layer of cerebellum and in cerebellar granule cells. It also prevents harmful ethanol effects on the survival and differentiation of cerebellar granule cells. Together our studies demonstrate that resveratrol may be a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of FASD.

N2  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of comprehensive community-based interventions to reduce fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in two populations from the Northern Cape Province in South Africa. Methods: Changes in the prevalence of FASD, and in maternal knowledge and drinking behaviour, were assessed in De Aar and Upington, Northern Cape Province, before and after an intensive community-level intervention. Eight community workers implemented educational activities to raise awareness of the risks of maternal drinking and to alter community norms about alcohol use in pregnancy. All children were examined by two dysmorphologists at 9 months of age and those with evidence of FASD were reassessed at 18 months. Neuropsychometrists evaluated infant neurodevelopment. Structured maternal interviews with FASD cases and matched controls determined patterns of alcohol use and knowledge about FASD. Results: At baseline, 809 children were evaluated, 751 after intervention. FASD prevalence pre-intervention was 8.9% (72/809) and 5.7% post intervention (43/751; p =.02). In multivariate logistic regression, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity, FASD prevalence was 0.73 fold lower post-intervention than pre-intervention (95%CI=0.58-0.90; p =.004). Dysmorphology scores reduced from 4 at baseline (IQR=2-7) to 3 (IQR=1-6; p =.002). After intervention, a large proportion of women reported having received educational messages, levels of knowledge about alcohol increased and some changes were detected in attitudes to drinking. Conclusion: Comprehensive community-level interventions might reduce the burden of FASD in heavily-affected areas of South Africa, by about 30%. This, the first study ever to document the effectiveness of FASD prevention using clinical outcomes, suggests that comprehensive community-level services should be implemented in similar settings to reduce this very common, oft neglected, disorder.

N2  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Many women drink during their childbearing years as well as use ineffective contraception. FAS-PACE Stepped Care Intervention (FSCI) utilized the Project CHOICES brief intervention model in implementing this "research to practice" model into 4 public health settings. In addition, FSCI utilized Case Management (CM) practices in two CM tiers. FSCI implementation goals were to prevent alcohol-exposed births by reducing alcohol use among women of childbearing age and/or increasing contraceptive knowledge/utilization. The purpose was to develop, implement, and evaluate population-based and targeted prevention programs for FASD Prevention. The project measured five main outcomes of the FSCI: 1. Reduce alcohol use among women of childbearing age 2. Reduce alcohol use among pregnant women. 3. Increase effective contraception 4. Decreased unintended pregnancies 5. Decrease stress levels The methods used were a multi-point, 3-Step, longitudinal design. The sample included 535 women between the ages of 12 and 44 who were sexually active (SA) risk drinking (RD) and were ineffectively using contraception or pregnant. Results: FAS-PACE intervention methods significantly reduced the number of women who self-reported binge drinking and increased the number of women who used effective contraception in all three interventions. The stress levels were reduced in the case-managed Personal Skills and Personal Support interventions (p <.000). Narrative Summaries: FAS-PACE consisted of a stepped care intervention utilizing a continuum of services from brief intervention to 6 month intervention and to intensive 3 year intervention. Personal CHOICES program (brief intervention) had 244 women who received services. At the three-month follow-up, 68 women were contacted and of those, 34 (50%) no longer participated in binge drinking activities. At the six-month follow-up, 42 of 70 previous binge drinkers reported no longer drinking at risk levels. Forty women reported not using contraception effectively at intake with 24 doing so at the six-month follow-up. Personal SKILLS (up to 6 month intervention) program resulted in women reducing binge drinking at the (p <.05) level. The conclusion reached was that despite poor follow-up in this commonly transient population the FSCI program resulted in decreased risk drinking and increased contraception use among participants.

N2  - Due to the physical and psychological consequences of in utero alcohol exposure, it is imperative that caregivers have evidence-based interventions that lead to a decrease in alcohol use during pregnancy. Interventions based on theoretically active components of behavior change and motivation have the potential to decrease prenatal alcohol use and, consequentially, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. This study determined the effectiveness of a Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention in decreasing prenatal drinking. The influence of the MI intervention on pregnant women's drinking behaviors as mediated by Self-Determination Theory's concepts of basic psychological needs and autonomous motivations determined what mechanisms of the intervention evoked a change in behavior. Of 171 pregnant women who reported previous year alcohol use, 67 consented to participate with random assignment to an MI Intervention (MII) group or a No-MI Intervention Comparison (NIC) group. After receiving education regarding risks of prenatal alcohol use, both groups were assessed for alcohol usage, levels of basic psychological needs, and autonomous motivations at baseline and 4-6 week follow-up. The MII group received the intervention following the baseline assessments. Fifty-six pregnant women completed all study procedures. Structural equation modeling determined the effectiveness of the intervention in decreasing pregnant women's drinking behaviors as mediated by basic psychological needs and autonomous motivations over the 4-6 week period. Two significant paths were found between the type of intervention group and (i) changes in number of drink days per week (p <.05) and (ii) gains in levels of basic psychological needs (p <.05) with the NIC group reporting greater changes in both at follow-up. The MI intervention provided by this study was not found effective in decreasing pregnant women's drinking behaviors during pregnancy. Confounders, such as the standard education provided to both groups by the researcher who was trained in MI, may have provided an additional intervention that decreased the women's drinking behaviors in both groups. Decreased variability in levels of reported drinking, basic psychological needs, and autonomous motivations reported by the two groups at baseline may also have affected the results. This study provided the groundwork for future interventions that will assist pregnant women to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Despite efforts to increase public awareness and explicit recommendations to avoid alcohol while pregnant, rates of prenatal alcohol consumption have not declined in the last decade. Healthcare providers that interact regularly with the population at risk, have the utmost potential of preventing or changing this abusive behavior. Therefore, we aimed in this study to determine if obstetricians, family practitioners and pediatricians are aware of current recommendations, are well informed about fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and whether healthcare providers' own bias to alcohol consumption affected how information was conveyed to their patients. Methods: Staff, fellow, and resident physicians within the Cleveland Clinic system were surveyed using a web-based survey tool. The survey consisted of 38 questions on practice characteristics, knowledge of FASD, awareness of the risks of prenatal alcohol consumption, counseling practice, comfort level discussing FASD, social/moral attitudes regarding alcohol consumption, and demographics. Results: 12% of physicians felt that 1-3 drinks per week is safe while trying to become pregnant. Most physicians felt it was unsafe to consume alcohol while pregnant, but 10% felt that it is safe to consume alcohol during the third trimester. About a quarter of physicians were uncomfortable about discussing alcohol consumption with their patients and half of them stated that they are not current with the literature on prenatal alcohol exposure. More than 25% of physicians felt that they were not adequately trained to counsel their patients on the dangers prenatal alcohol exposure and more than half felt that their colleagues were not well educated on the subject. More male physicians felt that women who consume alcohol while pregnant should be subject to legal penalties, while more female physicians and physicians who have children felt that women who consume alcohol while pregnant are solely responsible for their actions if they continue to drink after being counseled. Finally, 90% of physicians felt that they have a professional responsibility to protect the developing embryo from alcohol consumption. Conclusion: From the results obtained we have concluded that obstetricians, pediatricians, and family practitioners need to be better informed on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. With this knowledge they can then convey this information to women of childbearing age and ultimately prevent FASD.

N2  - Alcohol drinking during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, with fetal alcohol syndrome being the most severe form of this disorder showing a collection of birth defects which include facial dysmorphology and neurological dysfunctions. Recently, it has been suggested that alcohol-mediated changes in microRNA profiles may account for the deficits associated with fetal alcohol exposure. MicoRNAs (miRNA) are non-coding RNAs approximately 21-23 nucleotides in length that are able to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding to target mRNA and either causing transcript degradation or halting translation. In this study, a zebrafish embryo model was used to examine an early alcohol exposure regimen during gastrulation on specific 2 miRNAs: miR-430a and let-7h. In early development of the zebrafish, miR-430 has been shown to regulate morphogenesis, clearance of maternal mRNAs, and brain rescue in MZdicer mutants; and let-7 is known to be involved in cell migration in the nervous system development. The zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 0.32, or 2% (w/v) alcohol (ethanol) beginning at 3.5 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and the treatment lasted for 4 hours during the gastrulation stage of the zebrafish embryo development. These developing embryos were evaluated for morphological alterations at 48 hpf and were sacrificed for miRNA analysis. MiRNA was isolated using the mirVana Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real time RT-PCR was used to verify the quantitative changes in miRNA expression with SYBR green based RT-PCR using MyiQ single-color RT-PCR detection system (BioRad). The RT-PCR data was normalized to U6 snRNA. The results showed that zebrafish embryos exposed to 2% alcohol exhibited significant morphological alterations, such as cardiac edema and a curved vertebral column. However, such defects were not observed in embryos exposed to 0.32% alcohol. The miRNA expression data showed that alcohol treatment did not alter the expression of let-7h or miR-430a. Nonetheless, the data showed a trend in decreasing mean deltaCT in the 2% alcohol treated group suggesting an increase in the expression of miR-430a, and a similar pattern of trend was found in the let-7h analysis.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure often results in neurodevelopmental deficit and growth retardation constituting phenotypes of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The type and extent of expression of these phenotypes following prenatal alcohol exposure depends on multifactorial environmental and genetic interactions, which are not well understood. We previously reported that mouse embryos exposed to alcohol (88 mM) at the stage of neurulation cause growth retardation and abnormal development of embryos with two major phenotypes - neural tube closed (Alc-NTC) and neural tube opened (Alc-NTO). We further demonstrated significant differences in DNA methylation between the Alc-NTO and Alc-NTC phenotypes, including a 10-fold greater number of methylated genes on Chromosome 10 and X in Alc-NTO than Alc-NTC (Liu et al., 2009). Here we show that genes on the X chromosome display increased DNA methylation and cluster together, both physically and functionally. Genomic location analysis showed that the 178 genes reside in 8 separate clusters within a chromosomal band of 0.5-3 cM: bands XqA1.1 (0.5 cM, 14 genes from Ppp1r3f-Ftsj1), XqA1.3 (0.25 cM, 7 genes from Ndufb11-Zfp182), XqA5 (1 cM, 6 genes from 3830403N18Rik-Zic3), XqA7.3 (1.5 cM, 17 genes from Nsdhl-Brcc3), XqD (2 cM, 10 genes from Ercc6l-Atp7a), XqF1 (1 cM, 9 genes from Bex2-Il1rapl2), XqF3 (2.5 cM, 13 genes from Pfkb1-Magea1) and XqF5 (1.5 cM, 9 genes from Ap1s2-Egf16). Ingenuity analysis further revealed that these gene clusters are closely related in function, including in cell cycle, cell death, cellular growth and proliferation, nervous system development, cancer, and cardiovascular system development. Analysis of gene expression using Affymetrix microarrays supported an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression for some genes. For example, Ftsj1 and Zic3, which are specifically responsible for the developmental disorders X-linked mental retardation and neural tube defects, showed increased methylation. The current study demonstrates that DNA methylation may serve as both a marker to predict neural tube defect and as a mechanism underlying abnormal gene function in fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Background: Heavy drinking during pregnancy is the cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), the leading known cause of mental retardation. L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1), a protein critical for promotion of neurite outgrowth is considered a major target for ethanol toxicity in FASD. Our previous studies suggest that ethanol inhibits L1 mediated neurite outgrowth by increasing the fraction of L1 within lipid rafts (LR). Objective: Our objective in this study is to determine whether the effect of ethanol is on the LR or on L1. We utilize L1 KO mice to prepare cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) that had only LR but no L1. Thus, exposure of these cells to ethanol only exposes LR, and not L1. Exposure of wild type (WT) CGN exposes both L1 and some LR. Our hypothesis is that if LR are the target of ethanol, then ethanol exposed LR (present in lysates of KO CGN) mixed with unexposed L1 (present in lysates of WT CGN) contains more L1 than unexposed KO CGN mixed with unexposed WT CGN. If L1 is the target, then ethanol exposed L1 (present in lysates of WT CGN) redistributes to unexposed LR (present in lysates of KO CGN). Methods: CGN from L1 KO and WT postnatal day 6 mice are cultured overnight separately. For ethanol exposure, CGN are incubated in 25 mM ethanol for 1 hour. Neurons are washed free of ethanol, suspended in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer at a ratio of L1 KO:WT 4:1 (to dilute the LR in WT) and mixed on ice for 1 hour. LR are isolated from the mixed lysates using sucrose density gradients. Ten fractions are collected and LR containing fractions are pooled (LR) and the remaining fractions are pooled (non-LR). Western blotting is performed to identify L1 in LR and non-LR. L1 is quantified by densitometry and the percent of total L1 in lipid rafts (%L1 in LR) is calculated (pixels in LR)/(pixels in LR + non-LR). Results: The %L1 in LR are: 7%,-/-KO/WT; 12.4%,-/+ KO/WT; 24.5%, +/-KO/WT; 22.7%, +/+ KO/WT. Only when the LR are exposed to ethanol does the %L1 in LR increase. Conclusion: This data may demonstrate that ethanol alters lipid rafts thereby increasing L1 within them.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure leads to long-lasting deficits in learning and memory. Using a rat model, we have previously shown that choline supplementation during early development can attenuate some fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), including deficits in learning and memory. Choline is a quatranary amine, classified as a nutrient essential for human health. It acts as a methyl donor, and subserves various signaling pathways, including its role as a precursor for platelet-activating factor, sphingosylphosphocholine, diacylglycerol, and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It is not known how choline is able to mitigate alcohol-related learning deficits; however, identifying these mechanisms could contribute to the identification of additional treatments for FASD. It is hypothesized that developmental alcohol exposure induces learning and memory deficits, in part, by altering cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus, a CNS structure well-known for its role in memory function. To test this hypothesis, quantitative autoradiography was used to measure the hippocampal density of M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes that bind acetylcholine. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were orally intubated with ethanol (5.25 mg/kg/day) from postnatal days (PD) 4 to 9, a period of brain development equivalent to the human 3rd trimester; controls received sham intubations. From PD 4 to 30, subjects were injected s.c. with choline chloride (100 mg/kg/day) or saline vehicle. After behavioral testing from PD 31 to 33, brain tissue was collected on PD 35 for autoradiographic analysis. Data from the binding studies indicate that early developmental alcohol exposure increases the expression of M1 and M2 receptors. Furthermore, choline supplementation attenuates the ethanol-related increase of muscarinic receptors to a level not significantly different from that of control subjects; choline had no effect on muscarinic receptors among controls. These data suggest that perinatal alcohol exposure can cause long-lasting changes in the development of the cholinergic system; specifically, it may lead to reductions in cholinergic release and consequent upregulation of muscarinic receptor expression. This study further shows that choline supplementation may be attenuate alcoholrelated behavioral changes by normalizing cholinergic function, possibly by increasing the availability of choline for acetylcholine synthesis.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a wide range of abnormalities including defects in stress axis function. One of the possible mechanisms of alcohol's effect is epigenetic reprogramming causing abnormal DNA methylation in the key genes regulating the stress response such as proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene. In previous work we have demonstrated the hypermethylation of the promoter region of the POMC gene and consequent decrease in the POMC gene expression in the hypothalamus of rats prenatally exposed to alcohol. Also, the affected rats showed significant increase in stress axis response manifested by the elevated level of plasma corticosterone. In order to verify that the alcohol effect is mediated by the methylation changes we supplemented maternal diet with the methylation donor choline. The data of pregnant rats fed with liquid diet containing ethanol or choline-supplemented diet containing ethanol were compared with the rats fed a control diet with and without choline. The methylation status of the proximal POMC promoter was determined by Real-Time PCR using the probes specific to the methylated and unmethylated state of the promoter region. The stress axis response was determined by measuring basal and LPS-induced corticostrone levels in plasma. The choline supplementation reversed the aberrant DNA methylation in the hypothalamic POMC promoter and normalized the POMC gene expression in the offspring. It also restored the plasma corticosterone level and stress hyperresponse back to the norm. These results show support that an aberrant methyl metabolism plays an important role in the epigenetic changes caused by fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been shown to cause abnormality in stress axis function in the offspring. Fetal alcohol exposed rat offspring shows increased corticosterone production and the hormone response to immune challenge such as lipopolysaccaride (LPS). However, it is not known whether these abnormal changes of basal and LPS-stimulated corticosterone levels is transmitted to next generations. To determine the trangenerational effect, we exposed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats to alcohol during gestational day 7 and 21 and produced F1 offspring. Then both male and female F1 rats were mated with the animals born from a different dam but fed a similar diet to obtain the F2 generation. A third generation (F3) was derived from a cross of the 2 similarly treated F2 rats from different dams. These rats were used to determine the basal and LPS-stimulated corticosterone levels in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the fetal alcohol exposure increased basal plasma level of corticosterone in both male and female rats during adulthood. Additionally, the LPS-induced corticosterone level was much higher in alcohol-fed than in control-fed rats. Interestingly, a higher corticosterone response to LPS was observed in the alcohol-fed female rats than in alcohol-fed male rats. The increased basal and LPS-induced corticosterone levels in alcohol-fed male offspring persisted for both F2 and F3 generations. However, alcohol-fed female offspring showed normal basal and LPS-induced corticosterone levels in F2 and F3 generation. These results suggest that fetal alcohol exposure increases stress axis hyperresponse both in male and females offspring. Furthermore, because the offspring (F1) and its germ cells (F2) were exposed to alcohol during development via F0 female, the persistence of alcohol effects in the F3 male but not in the F3 female indicates that the transgenerational effect of fetal alcohol is transmitted via male germ line.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure often results in neurodevelopmental deficit and growth retardation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The penetration and outcome of the alcohol exposure however is depending on multifactorial environment and genetic interaction which is not well understood. Here, we demonstrated that three strains of mice, C57BL/6N (C57), DBA2 (D2), and 129, have great scale of heterogeneous response to same dose of alcohol at same embryonic stage. All strains of mice were analyzed in whole embryo culture at gestation day 8.25 (E8.25) with or without alcohol administration at 88 mM for 6 hours in the initial stage. The embryos harvested two days from initial culture were evaluated for growth rate using Van Farby scoring system and for apoptotic marker caspase 3 staining. We found that forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, heart, optic vesicle, caudal neural tube, and hindlimbs of C57BL/6J were delayed in growth, while forebrain and optic vesicle did in D2, and none in 129, as compared to their controls respectively. Caspase3, an intermediate apoptotic marker, staining showed that large number of caspase 3-immunostaining (im) cells were found in parietal forebrain, midbrain, rhombencephalon, as well as in none-neural regions e.g. head, 1st and 2nd brachial arches in alcohol treated C57 embryos, only a few were found in corresponding regions of their controls. In contract, only a small number of caspase 3-im cells were found in either the alcohol treated or the controls of the D2 embryo. Similar caspase 3-im scale to D2 were found in 129 embryos, except minor increase in the dorsal optic vesicle, and VII & VIII cranial ganglia, and somites of the alcohol-treated. These observations indicated that mouse strains with different genetic background were response to alcohol in distinctive different manner. The alcohol-resistant strains, D2 and 129 may have genetic or epigenetic makeup, which differ to C57 and were protected against alcohol insult.

N2  - Alcohol exposure during fetal development poses a risk of subsequent neuroanatomical abnormalities in the brain. Human MRI studies indicate that fetal alcohol exposure can cause developmental abnormalities of the corpus callosum, and that certain patterns of morphological abnormalities of the corpus callosum may be related to specific learning disability profiles. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in midsagittal area of the corpus callosum would be evident in an ovine model of fetal alcohol exposure, in which pregnant ewes received IV infusions of alcohol (1.75 g/kg) or saline in a 3-day-on/4-day-off weekly binge pattern. Lambs from normal control, saline, first-trimester-only alcohol-exposure, and all-three-trimester alcohol-exposure groups were killed at 5 months age; brains were fixed in situ via intra-carotid perfusion. Brains were extracted and transected along the mid-sagittal plane, and both forebrain hemispheres were placed sagittal-side down on a clear surface supported at a fixed distance above a digital camera. Brains were then illuminated and photographed from below, at the same zoom level and fixed distance between the camera and brain, yielding digital images for unbiased comparison of callosal area. Image analysis software was used to precisely outline the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum in each hemisphere, with care taken to discriminate between white matter of the corpus callosum and white matter of the fornix. The cross-sectional outline was subdivided to obtain standardized measures (Witelson 1989) of length, total area, and areas of seven regional subdivisions (rostrum, genu, rostral body, anterior midbody, posterior midbody, isthmus and splenium). Although preliminary analyses with limited statistical power failed to reveal significant differences between the prenatal treatment groups, results suggest a tendency toward smaller total mid-sagittal areas in brains from alcohol-exposed lambs. Further development of these methods with more subjects may permit modeling of human alcohol-induced callosal dysmorphology in the sheep.

N2  - Introduction: Although prenatal alcohol exposure is often associated with a unique pattern of dysmorphic facial features (e.g., midfacial hypoplasia, short palpebral fissures), little is known about longitudinal changes in these features over the course of development. In a Cape Town, South African sample with variable alcohol exposure, we examined whether facial anthropometric measurements changed over a 4-year interval, and if facial measurements predicting alcohol exposure remained consistent across time. Methods: Data on 22 standard anthropometric landmarks were obtained from 3D facial images. The initial sample consisted of 15 children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 15 with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (HE), and 15 born to alcohol abstinent mothers (controls). 16 standard anthropometric features were measured at an average age of 5.0 years and 4 years later at 9.0 years. Logistic regression was used to identify a set of anthropometric measurements that optimally classified the sample at each time point. ANOVA was employed to compare relative growth of these features between the groups. Results: At both ages, lower facial depth alone distinguished FAS from controls (Age 5: sensitivity=86%, specificity=83%; Age 9: sensitivity=87%, specificity=93%). Correct classification was substantially lower at both ages when comparing HE and controls. At age 5, bitragal width was the only predictor with 70% sensitivity and 79% specificity. At age 9, nasal bridge length was the only predictor with 60% sensitivity and specificity. The FAS group demonstrated more relative growth compared to the HE group for outer canthal, palpebral fissure (p = 0.07), nasal length, lower facial height and total facial height (p = 0.023). The HE group exhibited more relative growth compared to the controls for minimal frontal, bizygomatic, bigonial, and inner canthal widths; upper, mid, and lower facial depths, and ear length. Conclusion: Anthropometric measures that correctly identify prenatal alcohol exposure in a homogeneous age group differ across age, which could be partially due to "catch-up" growth. Furthermore, different measures provide optimal classification when distinguishing FAS or HE from controls. These results support the clinical observation that FAS facial features become more subtle as the affected individuals age.

N2  - Dysmorphic facial features are one potential consequence of exposure to alcohol during human fetal development. Facial dysmorphology is a requisite feature for diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and is presently the most well-accepted means for identifying children with FAS. The purpose of this study was to assess whether prenatal alcohol exposure induces facial dysmorphology in our ovine model of prenatal alcohol exposure, by applying standard anthropometric facial measurements that have been shown to successfully classify FAS in a clinical sample. Time-pregnant ewes were assigned to one of four treatment groups: normal control, saline control, alcohol exposed during first trimester (gestational day [GD] 4-41), or alcohol exposure during all three trimesters (GD 4-132). Alcohol was administered as a 1.75 g/kg IV dose (infused over 60 minutes) in a 3-day-on/4-day off binge pattern, and 17 standard anthropometric features were measured on postnatal day 4. All data from the alcohol exposed lambs were combined for the current analysis. ANOVA was used to test if the 17 measurements were different between treatment groups and logistic regression was employed to identify a set of anthropometric measurements that optimally classified the sample. Only two measurement means (nasal bridge and lower facial height) were different between the alcohol-exposed and normal control groups. However, logistic regression successfully classified the alcohol-exposed from normal controls (sensitivity=81%, specificity=78%), based on bigonial width, lower facial depth, and nasal bridge length. Classification of alcohol-exposed from saline controls demonstrated approximately the same sensitivity but less accurate specificity (44%). These results demonstrate that the identification of prenatal alcohol exposure in this sheep model is effective using standard anthropometric facial measures, even when the single measurement averages were not different between the treatment groups. These findings provide evidence that the sheep model exhibits a facial dysmorphology phenotype, in addition to the previously demonstrated neuroanatomical and neurobehavioral deficits, confirming that this ovine model of prenatal alcohol exposure includes the key phenotypes of FAS.

N2  - Diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is difficult due to lack of distinct facial dysmorphic feature described in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Study in humans, using anthropomorphic facial measurements has begun to discriminate subtle difference against maternal drinking history. A parallel mouse facial model is also being studied with definitive information on dose and timing of alcohol exposure. In this study, we further study the craniofacial bone facial dysmorphology over time with goal of better identification of FASD phenotypes. Alcohol induced craniofacial bone dysmorphology in postnatal day 7 (P7) and 21 (P21) C57BL/6J mice were longitudinally studied, using micro-CT scanning and 3D linear measurements. Pregnant dams were administered liquid diet or ad libitum chow from embryonic day 7 (E7) to (E16). Four treatment groups were examined (CHOW, ALC-PF [prepregnancy alcohol and pregnancy isocaloric pair-fed], PF-PF [pre-and pregnancy pair-fed], and ALC-ALC [pre-and pregnancy alcohol]). All delivered pups were culled to 6/litter and surrogate fostered. Three dimensional microCT imaging was performed at P7 and P21, and 15 anthropometric 3D linear measures were collected. Data was examined by ANAOVA, and Logistic Regression to discern features that predict alcohol exposure with high accuracy. At P7, two width measurements (minimal frontal and inner canthal) showed significant alcohol induced differences comparing Alc-Alc to PF controls. Using Logistic Regression, at P7, 74% of the ALC-ALC mice vs 83% of the PF controls (PF-PF, and ALC-PF) were correctly predicted using two width measurements (inner canthal and minimal frontal). Similar prediction rates were achieved at P21 but with three different widths (minimal frontal, bigonial, inner orbital width). Current data indicates that alcohol induced craniofacial bone dysmorphology provides further information either independently or in conjunction with facial feature analysis to diagnosis for FASD. Further studies are in progress to delineate regional bone deformation in consequence of alcohol exposure.

N2  - Introduction: Craniofacial bone dysmorphology is an important but under explored diagnostic feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). To further understand the developmental consequences of alcohol exposure, this study was designed with the following objective: Identify the effect of alcohol exposure on underlying cranial facial bone growth in a mouse model, while taking into consideration the individual volume variation of the craniofacial region characterized by the centroid size of 17 manually labeled cranial facial bone landmarks. Methods: Three treatments of C57BL/6J dams, CHOW, ALC-PF (pre-pregnancy alcohol exposure and at-pregnancy isocaloric pair-fed), and ALC-ALC (pre-and at-pregnancy alcohol exposure) were studied. The Micro-CT scan yielded volumetric data for each mouse sample with 40x40x40 um3 voxel spacing. Pups born to all treated dams were scanned at postnatal 7 day (P7) and at P21 for longitudinal studies of craniofacial bone development. Using Amira Software,17 landmarks on the craniofacial bone surfaces were defined and the frontal, parietal, occipital and jaw bones were segmented. The centroid size of 17 landmarks and the volumes of the four bones were computed and analyzed using general linear model with SPSS 17.0 to examine effect of alcohol disposure on craniofacial bone development. Results: At P21, the most prominent patterns appeared when the centroid size was not involved as a covariate: ALC-ALC showed significantly less bone development (p < 0.001) in frontal, parietal and occipital regions than ALC-PF and CHOW, while the latter two groups did not differ in frontal, pariental or jaw bone volumes. At P7, group differences were detected by fewer measures. The centroid size at both P7 and P21 stages was significantly smaller (p < 0.003) in ALC-ALC than ALC-PF and CHOW, but was similar between the ALC-PF and CHOW groups. Conclusion: These results validate our hypothesis that at-pregnancy alcohol exposure has a significant impact on reducing craniofacial bone development after birth. And, the retardation of the craniofacial bone growth was exacerbated by age. Further studies will help delineate effects of quantity and frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure on craniofacial bone dysmorphology to enable diagnosis of FASD.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which includes a spectrum of cognitive, behavioral, and structural developmental deficits. Diagnosis of Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the more severe form of FASD, depends, in part on a distinct set of abnormal facial features (smooth philtrum, short palpebral fissures, thin upper vermilion). FASD children often exhibit no, or a subset, of facial features and clinical diagnosis is not reliable. Resent studies using 2D morphometry and discrimant analysis using C57BL/6 mouse embryos demonstrated how alcohol exposure produces a specific set of abnormal facial features that may assist in diagnosis of FASD with partial phenotypes. To improve facial recognition methods in a mouse model we analyzed facial dysmorphology using a 3D volume rendering methodology. We exposed C57BL/B6J dams (B6J) with alcohol (Alc) consisting of 4.8% (v/v) in a liquid diet for 16 days pre-pregnancy, chow and water diet during mating, and the alcohol liquid diet reinstated on gestational days 7(E7) to E17. Treatment controls included a pair-fed (PF) group and an ad lib access to chow and water (Chow). We established a computational analysis of facial feature using a detection algorithm to test the divergence of facial dysmorphology between treatment groups. Using micro-video digitization, high-resolution mouse micro-video facial images were acquired for a total of 30 mouse E17 embryos from each treatment group. The digitalized images were collected from a series of fixed camera angles with images taken from a sequence of 100 camera angles, which were stacked into a video volume. Using a feature extraction approach and video volume for classification of embryonic mouse images with treatments separated into alcohol exposed and normal (control) groups, we show prediction results for the 30 Leave-One-Out cross validation test with an overall classification rate is 86.75%. Visualization of the feature points, selected by the feature analysis algorithm, on the surface mapped to the original mouse shows that critical areas of the face that contribute to the alcohol effect focus on the eye and the mid-face regions. We suggest that 3D modeling of alcohol exposed mouse embryos will assist in defining facial features in FASD where partial dysmorphology subsets can be used to predict alcohol exposure with significant accuracy.

N2  - Prevention of alcohol use is difficult thus therapies that ameliorate alcohol's damage are desirable. The severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) increases with parity, implying the depletion of a protective maternal factor. Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency and causes neurodevelopmental deficits that parallel FASD. We hypothesized that moderate maternal ID exacerbates alcohol-induced associative learning impairments and tested this in offspring of iron-sufficient (IS) or ID rat dams using cerebellumdependent eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC) and hippocampus-and amygdala-dependent fear conditioning. We exposed pups to 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg/day alcohol during the brain growth spurt via gastric gavage (postnatal days 4-9; P4-9). ID dams had a subclinical ID and were not anemic. In contrast, ID offspring were anemic at P10 and had normalized with dietary repletion by adolescence. During adolescence, ID significantly exacerbated alcohol-induced associative learning deficits measured using ECC. Alcohol-exposed ID pups had values for CR frequency and amplitude that were~30% of the responses in ID-only or alcohol-only animals. In addition, the ID-alcohol combination significantly impaired outcomes in cued and contextual fear conditioning. However, the ID-alcohol combination did not affect motor coordination. To determine whether cellular losses were associated with the ECC behavioral deficits we examined cerebellar proliferation and apoptosis at P10. ID and alcohol did not alter proliferation; however, ID significantly increased alcohol-induced apoptosis 2-fold in comparison to IS animals of the same alcohol dose. This is the first study to show that subclinical maternal ID profoundly and specifically exacerbates alcohol's effects on associative learning in the offspring. We propose that maternal iron status is an important modulator of fetal neurobehavioral outcome following alcohol exposure. Increased monitoring and treatment of ID in at-risk pregnancies may ameliorate damage to the fetus.

N2  - Alcohol dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of alcohol. Expression of 3 alleles at the ADH1B locus results in enzymes that differ in turnover rate and affinity for alcohol. The ADH1B*3 allele, which appears to be unique to African Americans, is associated with more rapid alcohol metabolism than the more prevalent ADH1B*1 allele. We and others have previously demonstrated that the presence of at least one maternal ADH1B*3 allele confers a protective effect against alcohol teratogenicity in African American infants and children (McCarver et al.,1997; Jacobson et al., 2006; Arfsten et al., 2004; but cf. Stoler et al., 2002). This study was conducted to determine whether the maternal ADH1B*3 allele continues to be protective in alcohol-exposed individuals during adolescence. 186 adolescents and 167 mothers participating in the 14-year follow-up of the Detroit Longitudinal Cohort had been genotyped for ADH1B alleles. The frequencies of the ADH1B*3 allele were 17.6% in the mothers and 21.0% in the adolescents, which are consistent with the 22% expected for the African American population. Confirming previous studies, prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with reduced head circumference and increased attention problems and externalizing behaviors in adolescents born to mothers with two ADH1B*1 alleles but not in those whose mothers had at least one ADH1B*3 allele. By contrast, the presence of an ADH1B*3 in the adolescent did not protect against any fetal alcohol-related deficits at this age. Moreover, the presence of at least one ADH1B*3 allele in the adolescent was associated with alcohol-related deficits in executive function and arithmetic calculation that were not seen in adolescents with two ADH1B*1 alleles. No differences in pregnancy alcohol intake were found in mothers with the ADH1B*3 allele. This study demonstrates that the protective effects of the maternal ADH1B*3 allele continue to be evident during adolescence and suggests that differences in alcohol metabolism genes may help account for individual differences in the vulnerability of offspring to the effects of fetal alcohol exposure. The protective effect of the maternal ADH1B*3 allele may be due to the more rapid metabolism of alcohol that it confers on the mother, which presumably results in a reduction of the peak blood alcohol concentration to which the fetus is exposed during each drinking episode.

N2  - Maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can induce a range of behavioural and cognitive deficits in offspring, which are collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). There are significant delays in motor development and sensory-motor skills in children with FASD, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these deficits are poorly understood. The goal of this research project is to test the hypothesis that the Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movements (KINARM) will serve as an effective tool for identifying and measuring specific, neurologically-based motor deficits in children with FASD. These deficits will be revealed through investigation of multi-joint upper limb movements during the performance of sensory-motor tasks (reaching and arm positionmatching tasks). Children (21 FASD; 86 Controls, aged 6 to 17 years, male and female) performed two separate tasks: (i) a visually-guided reaching task with fingertip feedback only; and (ii) an arm position-matching task in the absence of visual feedback. Children with FASD significantly differed from controls in many reaching task outcome measures, specifically those measures related to the initial motor response (distance and direction errors), corrective responses, and total movement time. In particular, exceptionally large effect sizes were observed for outcome measures related to the first (initial) movement (e.g. distance and direction error), and the total movement path length relative to the optimal path length. In the position-matching task, children with FASD constricted the spatial workspace of the subjectcontrolled arm relative to the robot-controlled arm in both the horizontal and vertical axes. The results suggest that children with FASD have difficulty integrating sensory information into planned motor movements. The KINARM is a promising research tool that may be used to assess motor control deficits in children affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) describes the continuum of adverse effects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, and attention are particularly affected in children with FASD. Eye movement tasks have proven to be a powerful tool for assessing deficits in executive function in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate aspects of executive function using a remote video-based eye tracking system in children with FASD. Children with FASD and ageand sex-matched control children performed a delayed memory-guided sequential task and a predictive task. In the delayed memory-guided sequential task, each trial began with the appearance of a central fixation point (FP) followed by the sequential appearance of two targets illuminated briefly in two of four quadrants of the screen. After a variable delay the central FP was extinguished, instructing the subject to generate two saccades to the remembered target locations in the same sequence in which they appeared. This task assessed the ability to suppress planned saccadic responses as well as working memory. In the predictive task, subjects were instructed to follow a target that alternated between two known locations in the right or left hemi-field at either specific inter-stimulus intervals of 750 ms and 1000 ms, or pseudo-randomly (interleaved trials). This task assesses the ability to adjust motor responses to a predictable sensory pattern. In the delayed memory-guided sequential task children with FASD had shorter latency SRT's, indicative of an increased frequency of timing errors. However, there were no differences between groups on the parameter of spatial working memory (correct sequence of saccades). In the predictive task, the FASD group differed from controls with respect to SRT, but not in amplitude or velocity of saccades. In contrast to the control group, SRT's within the FASD group did not differ between the fixed inter-stimulus intervals and the interleaved trials. These results suggest that subjects with FASD have difficulty using sensory information to modify the motor program. Together, these findings demonstrate that eye movement tasks can be used to assess deficits in response inhibition and sensory-motor integration in children with FASD.

N2  - Studies of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have consistently shown executive function deficits. In addition, one cross-sectional study has suggested that impairments in some aspects of executive function become more pronounced with age in this population. The goal of this project was to examine the development of executive abilities in a small longitudinal sample of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and typicallydeveloping controls. Fourteen children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) and nine non-exposed control children (CON), ages 7-14, were administered the Verbal Fluency (VF) and Trail Making (TM) tests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) twice, 1 to 5 years apart. Primary Measures included total correct responses for VF conditions (Letter Fluency, Category Fluency, Category Switching) and completion times for TM conditions (Visual Scanning, Number Sequencing, Letter Sequencing, Number-Letter Switching, Motor Speed). The difference between scaled scores was calculated to measure the rate of change relative to the norm on each of these eight Primary Measures. Scores were analyzed using analysis of variance techniques. The main effect of group was not significant, suggesting that change in performance over time on measures of VF and TM does not differ between groups. These data fail to replicate a previous cross-sectional study suggesting that children with FASD have difficulties with some executive function tasks which grow more pronounced with age. Based on this small longitudinal sample, it appears that performance on these executive function measures may develop at a rate similar in children with FASD and controls. Although children with FASD display impairments on measures of executive functioning, these impairments do not appear to worsen over time. Although our study was limited by a small sample size, it demonstrates the potential value of utilizing longitudinal techniques to address developmental changes in this population. Additional studies are needed to further examine the development of executive abilities in children with FASD.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with a continuum of neuropsychological and behavioral difficulties; the most severe outcome on this continuum is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The characteristic facial features of FAS allow identification of affected individuals. However, neuropsychological difficulties also occur in alcohol-exposed children who do not meet criteria for FAS. Because these children lack physical markers of maternal alcohol use, the link between prenatal alcohol exposure and neurobehavioral difficulties may be minimized. Clarification of a distinct neurobehavioral profile of prenatal alcohol exposure could aid in identification of alcohol-exposed children and lead to earlier interventions for affected individuals. In one previous investigation, latent profile analysis (LPA) was used successfully to distinguish alcohol-exposed children from controls using measures that focused primarily on executive function and spatial processing. The current study sought to extend this work by including a broader range of neuropsychological domains. A standardized neuropsychological test battery was administered individually to 174 children ages 6-16 with heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol but not FAS (n=63) and typically developing controls (n=111) and data were analyzed with LPA. To maximize power, 17 measures were selected based on their ability to distinguish between groups. Variables included measures of language, executive function, academic achievement, fine motor skills, visuomotor integration, learning, memory, and attention. Results indicated that a 2-class model best fit the data. Model fit was determined by testing multiple class solutions (e.g. 1 vs. 2-class models) and then evaluating two fit indices, the Akaike Information Critreria and Bayesian Information Criterion. In addition, the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test for the 1 vs. 2-class solution was evaluated. The resulting profile successfully distinguished subjects with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls with 79% overall accuracy; 81.0% of alcohol-exposed cases and 77.5% of controls were correctly classified. These data build on previous work and suggest that a wide range of neuropsychological measures can be used to distinguish nondysmorphic alcohol-exposed children from typically developing controls.

N2  - Volume of caudate nucleus but not hippocampus has been shown to be affected by fetal alcohol exposure (Archibald et al. 2001; Astley et al., 2009); both studies used manual tracing. Volumes of caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were measured using tracing by a senior neuroanatomist (CW) and FreeSurfer, an automated brain segmentation program. Structural MRI data were obtained from 32 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) school-age children at 11.6 years (range=9.7-13.7) on a Siemens 3T Allegra scanner. 13 were heavily alcohol exposed, and 19 had mothers who abstained or drank at low levels during pregnancy. Five were diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and 8 were heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE). Inter-observer reliabilities for the manual tracing ranged from r=.94-.99, Median=.98. Manual tracing was highly correlated with FreeSurfer volumes, rs ranged from.74 for right hippocampus to.89 for total caudate, Median=.83. Frequency of alcohol use during pregnancy was related to smaller volumes based on both tracing (caudate, r=-.44, p =.01; corpus callosum, r=-.38, p <.05; hippocampus, r=-.32, p =.07) and automated segmentation (caudate, r=-.39, p >.05; corpus callosum, r=-.40, p <.025; hippocampus, r=-.36, p <.05) as well as smaller total intracranial volume (TIV; r=-.51, p<.01). There was a dose-dependent relation of diagnostic group to volumes of the three brain structures and TIV. Caudate, corpus callosum, and TIV were significantly smaller in the FAS group than HE and controls, and hippocampus was smaller in FAS than controls. Partial correlation was used to examine the degree to which the relation of fetal exposure with brain structure volume continued to be evident after adjustment for TIV. The relation of prenatal alcohol to caudate and corpus callosum volume was no longer significant but continued to be evident after control for TIV; by contrast, hippocampal volume was clearly no longer related to exposure. This study, which is the first to use FreeSurfer to examine brain structure in fetal alcohol exposed children, demonstrates the validity of this automated segmentation methodology, which is substantially more time-and cost-efficient than manual tracing. These data are also consistent with previous reports that caudate is disproportionately vulnerable to fetal alcohol exposure, whereas hippocampus is relatively spared.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol use in pregnancy is one of the few modifiable risk factors for poor pregnancy and child outcomes, including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Fetal alcohol exposure is one of the most common preventable causes of intellectual disability. Aims: To identify Australian women's preferred information sources, and their perceptions of health professionals' role regarding alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Methods: In 2006, via computer assisted telephone interview, we collected data from 1103 Australian women (69% participation) of childbearing age (18-45 years), including their preferred information sources, and the role of health professionals regarding alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Results: Half the participants had seen information about the effects of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. The most common sources were brochures (16%), media programmes or articles (13%), and television advertising (10%). Participants identified health professionals (52%) as the best source of information, followed by television advertisements (12%) and brochures (9%). The internet was a frequent second source of information (22%). Younger participants (18-29 years) were more likely to use the internet, family or friends, or school classes to find information; older participants (30-45 years) preferred media programmes or articles. Participants agreed that health professionals should ask pregnant women about alcohol (96.9%), should advise women how much alcohol is safe to drink in pregnancy (96.9%) and advise women who are thinking of becoming pregnant to give up drinking alcohol (91%). Conclusions: Australian women use a variety of information sources to learn about alcohol in pregnancy. However, in this survey they report a strong preference for health professionals to provide information to women including how much alcohol can be consumed safely in pregnancy. Strategies to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and prevent FASD should include clear guidelines for the community delivered via the preferred information sources women have identified in this survey.

N2  - Background: We have previously reported to this Society that fetal alcohol exposure during late gestation in sheep leads to endothelial dysfunction and increased stiffness in a wide range of vascular beds. Our present aim was to determine whether these effects persist into postnatal life. Method: Ethanol (0.75 g) was infused iv daily into 7 ewes, over 1 h, from 95 days to 135 days of gestation (term ~145 days). Control ewes (n = 7) received saline. The lambs were born normally and, at 8 weeks, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined in vivo. At 9 weeks the lambs were euthanised, and small (~250 lm diameter) coronary, renal, mesenteric, femoral and cerebral artery reactivity and wall stiffness were tested in vitro. Results: Endothelial relaxation was impaired in renal, femoral and mesenteric arteries from alcohol exposed lambs [P = 0.001]. Constriction was en- hanced in the femoral, and relaxation to nitroprusside impaired in renal and femoral vessels [P = 0.01]. Cerebral and coronary arteries were not affected. PWV was reduced in alcohol exposed lambs [P = 0.006], suggesting arteries were less stiff. Indeed, coronary and femoral vessels were more compliant when tested in vitro, but renal, mesenteric and cerebral arteries were stiffer following alcohol exposure. The reduction in PWV was greater in males. Conclusions: The vasodilator dysfunction identified in alcohol exposed fetuses persists postnatally in some vascular beds. In contrast, the arterial stiffness observed in alcohol-exposed fetuses is reversed, giving way to increased compliance associated with lower PWV in lambs. These permanent vascular changes in early postnatal life may lead to life long risk for vascular disease.

N2  - Background: Few studies have investigated the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on the developing lung. We recently showed that alcohol exposure during the third trimester impairs the maturation and immune status of the fetal ovine lung. Our present aim was to investigate whether these alterations persist into postnatal life. Methods: Pregnant ewes were catheterized at gestational day (GD) 90 and infused daily with ethanol (0.75 g/kg i.v., n = 9) or saline (n = 7) over 1 h from GD95-135. Ewes gave birth naturally at term (~GD147). At two months after birth, lung tissue was collected and the lung parenchyma was morphometrically analyzed. Surfactant protein (SP)-A, -B, -C and -D and interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Surfactant phospholipid composition in lung lavage fluid was analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: There were no significant differences in lung tissue weight, volume and morphometry, collagen content, pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and surfactant phospholipid composition between the control and ethanol-exposed groups. SP-D mRNA levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the ethanol-exposed lambs compared to controls. Conclusions: Daily prenatal ethanol exposure during the third trimester does not significantly alter lung growth and structure at two months after birth. Although SP-D expression was not altered in the fetus, it was increased in ethanol-exposed lambs; as SP-D has immunomodulatory roles, innate immunity may be altered. As the alterations observed in the fetal lung immediately following ethanol exposure do not persist, this suggests the lung is able to repair.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which is linked to early pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction, and impaired placentation. Alcohol impairs the immune response, but its effects on the complex interactions between the feto-placental unit and the maternal immune system, which arc necessary for placentation, are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of chronic gestational exposure to alcohol on cytokine expression profiles in placenta, mesometrial triangle (MT-implantation site), amniotic fluid, and maternal serum. Design: Pregnant Long-Evans rats were fed with isocaloric liquid diets in which alcohol comprised 0% (N= 4) or 24% (N= 8) of the caloric content, starting on gestational day (GD) 6. Blood, amniotic fluid, placentae, and MT were harvested on GD 18. The samples were subjected to a bead-based multiplex ELISA, which included measurement of 11 pro-inflammatory cytokines, 5 anti-inflammatory cytokines, 5 anti-inflammatory chemokines, 1 pro-inflammatory chemokine, and 2 growth factors. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. Results: 24-plex analysis revealed that, in controls, the levels of nearly all analytes measured, except GCSF, IL-1beta, and TNF-alphafz were in higher in placenta as compared to the MT. Gestational alcohol exposure significantly reduced expression of 9 cytokines in the MT, 7 of which were pro-inflammatory in nature (IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, IP-10, and MCP-1). The 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines reduced by ethanol exposure were IL-5 and eotaxin. In contrast, VEGF was significantly elevated in the MT of alcohol-exposed dams. Alcohol exposure had no significant effect on cytokine expression profiles in placental tissue, amniotic fluid, or maternal serum. Conclusion: Chronic gestational exposure to alcohol alters cytokine expression profiles at the site of implantation. Alcohol-mediated reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are needed to promote trophoblast implantation, could represent a critical factor in the pathogenesis of impaired placentation in FASD. Moreover, increased VEGF expression could reflect persistence of non-converted maternal vessels associated with ethanol exposure.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is characterized by growth deficiency and all models of intrauterine growth restriction demonstrate reductions in uterine blood flow (UBF). Pregnancy-induced increases in UBF (30 fold) are associated with elevation in eNOS expression, phosphorylation, and NO production at the level of UAECs. We hypothesized that alcohol will reduce eNOS expression and its activity by reducing eNOS phosphorylation via alterations in the signaling pathways that control eNOS activity in UAECs. UAECs from pregnant ewes (gestational day 120-130) were validated using FACS. Maternal binge drinking patterns were mimicked; UAECs (passage 4, n = 5 replicates) were treated with 0 (control), 60, 90, 120, or 150 mg/ dl of alcohol in a compensating system for 3 h on 3 consecutive days. Cell viability was validated by trypan blue microscopy, Calcein AM imaging, and caspase 3 immunoblotting. The number of viable cells between groups was not different (control, 891,250 + 11,433; alcohol, 834,000 + 49,784; P=0.73). Uncleaved caspase 3 was unaltered and cleaved caspase 3 was undetectable. Compared to control, at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl alcohol, total eNOS level was significantly reduced to 70%, 70%, 63%, and 43% respectively. p635eNOS also decreased substantially to 29%, 21%, 18%, and 15% with increasing alcohol doses. Caveolin-1, a protein associated with eNOS was significantly decreased only at the highest dose. Investigation of the ERK1/2 pathway, the major signaling cascade coupled to eNOS activation in UAECs revealed that total ERK1 was reduced to 87%, 75%, 55%, and 16% and total ERK2 was reduced to 66%, 55%, 35%, and 21%, respectively at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl alcohol. Further, pERK1 level was reduced to 57%, 32%, 29%, and 24% with increasing alcohol doses. These alterations were specific to ERK1/2 signaling in that pAKT or total AKT were not altered among groups. These data were consistent with and validated by both confocal imaging as well as high throughput proteomics. These data delineate the effects of binge alcohol on the abundance and post-translational modification via phosphorylation of eNOS and ERK1/2 enzymes in UAECs. Further, stoichiometrically disproportional levels of eNOS and caveolin-1 may influence eNOS activation. These results strongly suggest that intrauterine environment plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of FASD.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Youth living with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) face particular challenges in achieving success in school, the workplace, and the wider community. Risk and protective factors each affect the youths' ability to maximize their potential, greatly influencing outcomes. There is an urgent need for an assessment tool that reflects these risk and protective factors experienced throughout their life, as well as the youths' lived experiences. The present study attempts to create an interview tool that will better assess resilience levels among young males. Methods: Focus groups comprised of the researcher, a young male living with FASD, and adults close to the young male, constructed interview questions to match the cognitive ability of the young male; questions examine early life stability, risk factors, resilience levels, world view, and temperament. Using an iterative research design, this tool will identify the effect of these and other criminogenic factors on life outcomes for predominantly urban males, 16 to 20 years of age, who are or have been involved with the justice system. Results: It is expected that this tool will greatly assist in accurately predicting the negative relationship between instability in daily living and positive life outcomes for youth living with FASD. Conclusions/Discussion: Through the use of this tool, risk factors will be better identified and processes can be implemented for early interventions with families unable to provide a stable and supportive environment for their children, particularly if their children are living with the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) in meconium are validated biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure. In clinical practice, meconium analysis can potentially be used to identify newborns at risk for alcohol-related disabilities, who can then be followed up and assisted if any disabilities emerge. This study aims to determine whether women are willing to partake in such screening by assessingmaternal participation in a pilot neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: All Grey-Bruce women delivering at St. Joseph's Hospital were offered a screening program involving meconium analysis and long-term follow-up of positive cases. With consent, meconium was collected and tested for FAEE using validated methods. Positive cases were followed-up by a public health nurse who conducted timely developmental assessments and made referrals to appropriate intervention programs if delays emerged. The rates of voluntary participation and positivity for fetal exposure in this open screening program were then compared to the rates previously observed in this population when testing was offered anonymously. Results: Of the 55 women who were offered screening, 43 consented. Among these, one positive case was identified and is currently being followed-up by the Public Health Department. The consent rate in this open screening program is significantly lower (p<0.05) than in the previous study where testing was anonymous (78% vs. 94%, respectively), and the positivity rate is only 3%in contrast to 30% positivity rate observed with anonymous testing (p<0.01). Conclusions: Findings suggest that open screening results in lower participation and low positivity for fetal exposure. This implies that despite the potential benefits of such screening programs, maternal unwillingness to consent may severely limit the usefulness of meconium testing for large population-based open screening.

N2  - Case report:: A 16-year old girl presented after two generalized seizures for neurological assessment. At the age of 9 years fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was diagnosed based on microcephaly, characteristic facial anomalies including short palpebral fissures, thin vermilion border of the upper lip and smooth philtrum as well as postnatal growth retardation and global cognitive deficits. Neurological examination was otherwise normal. A waking state EEG showed focal slowing and focal sharp waves in the right temporal region, an EEG during sleep was normal. MRI of the brain revealed an abnormally thick cortex with bilateral polymicrogyria (PMG) in the superior frontal gyrus with asymmetric distribution. Discussion: A wide range of cerebral malformations is associated with FAS as demonstrated in both histological and neuroradiological studies. There is experimental evidence that alcohol interferes with many molecular, neurochemical and cellular events occurring during normal development of the brain. In the first month of human gestation maternal ethanol drinking is associated with a great incidence of craniofacial and neuronal tube anomalies. In the second trimester alcohol exposure reduces the number of neurons and glia cells in the neocortex and induces changes in radial glia as well as neuronal proliferation, generation, and migration. During the third trimester of gestation alcohol interferes with synaptogenesis as well as glial development, increases natural cell death and cell necrosis, and involves the impairment of neuronal cell migration. PMG in FAS has been described only in a single patient who was included in a neuropathology study in 1979. The autopsy of this patient revealed PMG in the orbital, temporal, and parieto-occipital surfaces. In our patient history, clinical features, and genetic investigations provided no evidence for any of the known genetic or acquired causes of PMG. Therefore, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of PMG in our patient rather than a mere coincidence. Conclusion: We present the 2nd patient of PMG in FAS and confirm the phenotypic variability of cerebral malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In patients with severe neurological impairment or seizures neuroimaging is recommended. Furthermore, FAS should be considered as a differenzial diagnosis for PMG.

N2  - Background: A cardinal feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), and models of IUGR demonstrate dysfunctional maternal uterine vascular adaptations including lower uterine blood flow and decreased angiogenesis. This altered remodeling is mediated in part by estrogen, which is significantly elevated during gestation. Further, estrogen specifically induces ovine pregnant uterine artery endothelial cell (P-UAEC) proliferation. Hypothesis: In this study, we hypothesized that there exists an interaction between estrogen and alcohol on ovine P-UAEC proliferation. Methods: P-UAECs were isolated from pregnant ewes(gestationalday120-130; term= 147), FACS sorted, validated, and maintained in culture to passage 4. To mimic maternal binge drinking patterns, P-UAECs were cultured in the absence or presence of alcohol (150 mg/dl) in a compensating system for 3 h on 3 consecutive days. Cell viability was validated by trypan blue exclusion microscopy, Calcein AM imaging, and immunoblotting. Following this treatment paradigm, control and binge alcohol treated P-UAECs were abstained from alcohol for two days and then treated with increasing concentrations of estrogen (0.1, 1, 10 nM) in the presence or absence of alcohol. Angiogenesis index was evaluated using BrdU Proliferation Assay. Results: Trypan blue stained cell count demonstrated that the number of viable cells in the control and binge alcohol groups were not different (control, 891,250 +/- 11,433; alcohol, 834,000 +/- 49,784; P = 0.73). We also observed that uncleaved caspase 3 was unaltered by binge alcohol and cleaved caspase 3 was not detectable demonstrating cell viability. A significant main effect of the alcohol treatment paradigm was noted (two way ANOVA, P = 0.003). Irrespective of the dose, estrogen-induced P-UAEC proliferation was significantly decreased in response to chronicbingealcohol(P = 0.025). Incontrast, estrogen-induced proliferation trended higher in response to acute alcohol treatment (P = 0.057). Further, estrogen-induced proliferation in chronic binge treated P-UAECs was significantly lower compared to acute alcohol treatment (P <0.001). Interestingly, these findings were closely associated with the effects of binge alcohol on the activity state and expression of the angiogenesis-associated enzyme eNOS and its related signaling cascades. Alcohol decreased P635eNOS, total eNOS, PERK1, total ERK1, and total ERK2 to 15%, 43%, 24%, 16%, and 21%, respectively whereas no alterations were observed with the AKT pathway. Conclusions: Thus: 1) proliferative effects of alcohol depend on the alcohol treatment paradigm; 2) chronic binge alcohol impairs estrogen-induced proliferation; 3) binge alcohol decreases the expression and activity of eNOS, a protein associated with P-UAEC proliferation; 3) effects of chronic binge alcohol on P-UAECs are specifically associated with ERK cascade not AKT pathway; and 5) these findings support the idea that the uterine compartment may play a key role in the pathogenesis of FASD.

N2  - The number of multiple congenital anomaly syndromes is increasing. Dysmorphology is important in the recognition and description of syndromes. Information obtained from studies of developmental and cellular processes in lower organisms has offered significant contributions to the understanding of the pathogenesis of syndromes. Most of the syndromes have genetic defects including chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations. Mutations in genes for transcription factors, growth factors, receptors, cell adhesion molecules, signal transduction, structural proteins, and transporters have been identified in genetic syndromes. In addition, alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which includes a range of developmental deficits. Fetal anticonvulsant syndromes are another example of environmental factors. Clinical use of genetic diagnosis is rapidly developing. Molecular diagnosis is available in many of the well known syndromes. Genome-wide screening of patients with multiple congenital anomaly and/or mental retardation using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization has recently led to the identification of new microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Proper diagnosis of syndromes makes it possible to provide genetic counseling for the parents, medical care and an accurate prediction relative to such a child's future development. Longitudinal observation of patients is necessary for better clinical management. Clinical investigations can also help to identify the genes involved in normal and abnormal morphogenesis, which often act as patterning genes and transcription factors that regulate other genes during embryonic development. Cooperation between basic studies and clinical genetics will produce promising results.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal stress was shown to induce a chronic anxiety state in adult humans. In addition to stress, fetus can be affected by alcohol. In USA 12.2% pregnant women are reported to use alcohol [1]. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by physical, psychical, and behavioral disturbances and learning deficit. The aim of the work was to study the influence of prenatal stress in combination with alcohol on locomotor activity, anxiety, and social behavior (sniffing and licking) of mice. Methods: Pregnant CBA/LacJ mice were given 11% ethanol solution ad libitum throughout gestation (without access to water) and stressed (restriction two hours daily in an unpredictable manner) during the last week of pregnancy. Three-month-old male offspring (A+S) were tested in the open field, dark-light box, elevated plus maze, marble burying, and social interaction tests. The control group consisted of the male mice of the same age from non-stressed dams, which had drunk the water during gestation. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA Results: In the marble burying test, A+S animals buried significantly more marbles (7.7+/-1.1) than intact ones (4.1+/-0.5) [F(1,27) = 8.77, P<0.01]. In the social interaction test, A+S animals spent more time (300.8+/-20.7 s) sniffing and licking three-week-old male mouse than intact ones (190.5+/-11.4 s) [F(1,28) = 21.75, P<0.001]. The total path length in the open field, test and the time spent in the center of the open field, for A+S mice did not differ from that of intact ones [F(1,17) = 0.001, P>0.05] and [F(1,17) = 0.32, P>0.05]. In the dark-light box test, no significant differences between A+S and intact animals in the time spent in the light compartment were found [F(1,16) = 0.94, P>0.05]. In the elevated plus maze test, there were also no differences in the time spent in open arms between A+S and control mice [F(1,16) = 0.06, P>0.05]. Therefore, in three tests for anxiety (dark-light box, elevated plus maze, time in the center of the open field) no significant effect of prenatal stress and alcohol exposure was found. The marble burying test is considered as an experimental model of obsessivecompulsive disorder [2,3]. An increased number of buried marbles and the enhanced social activity time in A+S mice were shown. Significantly increased sniffing and licking in A+S animals represent the manifestation of obsessions and compulsions rather than social interaction. The lack of any differences between A+S and control animals in the path length in the open field test showed that an increased marble burying and social activity was not associated with locomotor activity deviation. Conclusions: Stress and alcohol during prenatal development do not influence on anxiety state and locomotor activity in mice. Prenatal exposure to stress and alcohol can produce obsessivecompulsive- like behavior.

N2  - Objective: The fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the leading non genetic cause of mental disability and social and emotional problems in affected children, adolescents and young adults. However, efforts on research and prevention up to date have been poor. Materials and methods: In the Muenster University FAS clinic 135 young FAS patients were assessed for IQ, sustained attention, memory, information processing and psychosocial development. Additionally, social and emotional outcome was studied in 60 adult patients with FAS. Results: Children and adolescents with FAS show severe deficits in cognitive functioning. They suffer from a burdensome social and emotional maladaptation. Most adult FAS patients live in dependent circumstances. The occupational development is characterized by disruption and failure, and severe social problems are common in patients. Three in four adult patients are victims of (sexual) abuse. Conclusions: Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes severe cognitive, emotional and behavioural impairments in the child. Deficits are irreversible and persisting. Prevention of FAS, thus, is essential in gynecological counseling. Due of the variety of impairments caused by prenatal alcohol exposition and the persisting inability of independent living, patients with FAS need intense care, support and assistance throughout life.

N2  - Cerebral angiogenesis during brain development is under control of growth factors from the vascular endothelial growth factor family (VEGF). The fact that alcohol affects VEGF expression and angio-genesis in adults prompted us to investigate whether prenatal alcohol exposure may alter brain vascularization in both rodent and human foetuses. Mouse foetuses and pups were exposed to different concentrations of alcohol (0.5-3 g/kg) from embryonic day 13 to the first day of life (P1). Twelve foetuses with foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and age matched controls (22-36 WG) were also selected. Morphometric analyses on Glut1 immunostained brain slices were carried out. Protein and mRNA levels of the endothelium marker PECAM and VEGF receptors were quantified by q-RT-PCR and Western blot in mice. Calcimetry and videomicroscopy studies were performed on mouse cultured endothelial cells. In mice, perinatal alcohol exposure induced a dose-dependent reduction of the vascular network with a disorganization of microvessels which were randomly distributed. Protein and mRNA levels of PE-CAM and VEGF receptors were significantly reduced. Alcohol inhibited glutamate-induced calcium mobilization in endothelial cells and affected microvessel growth and survival. Though microvessel density was not significantly modified in human brains, cortical micro-vessel architecture was disorganized, 30-50% of vessels being non radially oriented 30 WG onwards. These results suggest that alcohol-induced developmental brain abnormalities could be partly due to vascular defects, and that members of the VEGF family would have an interest as FAS biomarkers.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol use in pregnancy has been associated with numerous adverse effects including miscarriage, stillbirth, malformations, low birthweight and infant mortality. Developmental problems and fetal alcohol syndrome may occur. Despite national recommendations to abstain from alcohol use during pregnancy, rates remain high in Australia. Co-morbid psychiatric and alcohol use disorders are common and have been shown to have detrimental effects on treatment outcomes, with increased medical comorbidity, suicide, violence, child abuse. Aims: To determine the use of alcohol during pregnancy in women referred to a perinatal mental health team. Methods: A retrospective study of pregnant women referred to a perinatal mental health team was undertaken. A review of medical records identified the reported use of alcohol during pregnancy, demographic details including age, employment status, marital status, parity and psychiatric diagnosis. Outcomes of pregnancy recorded include gestational age at birth of baby, birth weight and malformations. Results: Of the 27 cases referred to the perinatal mental health clinic, 2 reported alcohol use during pregnancy. The average age was 28.96 years. 85.2% (23/27) were married or in a relationship; 14.8% (4/7) were single. 44.4% (12/27) were employed, 40.7% (11/27) were unemployed and there was a lack of data recorded on the employment status of 14.8% (4/27) cases. The mean number of previous pregnancies was 2.19. Psychiatric diagnoses were depression in 37% (10/27), anxiety in 22.2% (6/27), anorexia nervosa in 3.7% (1/27) case. 37% (10/27) recorded no psychiatric disorder. The average gestational age was 38 weeks. Mean weight of newborn babies was 3.41 kg. There were no major malformations identified in these cases; one newborn had an abnormal toe position. Discussion: Co-morbid alcohol use and psychiatric disorders can result in significant negative outcomes for the mother and offspring. The findings of this study indicate that alcohol use during pregnancy is low. These findings may be due to limitations of the study. Data is self-reported and may be underreported due to social desirability. In addition, the small numbers used in this study is a limitation. Alcohol use during pregnancy continues to be highly prevalent in Australia and a public health concern. It is important to identify these women early and implement appropriate management to minimize the harm of both alcohol and psychiatric illness to the mother and offspring.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure is known to induce deficiencies in fetal brain development. We found that ADNF-9, a peptide derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor and composed of nine amino acids (SALLRSIPA) is neuroprotective. We used a mouse model of fetal alcohol exposure to identify the intracellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v) ethanol derived calories; (2) pair-fed control; (3) ALC combined with administration (i.p.) of ADNF-9 (20 and 30 mug/20 g body weight); and (4) pair-fed combined with administration (i.p.) of ADNF-9 (20 and 30 mug/20 g body weight). On E13 fetal brains were collected, weighed, and assayed for Bcl2 protein levels using Western blot. Our results show that ADNF-9 significantly prevents alcohol-induced reductions in fetal brain weight at both doses. Western blot analysis of mitochondrial protein fractions revealed that prenatal alcohol exposure causes a significant down-regulation in Bcl2 protein levels. Importantly, ADNF-9 administration reduced this alcohol-induced decrease in Bcl2 at only the highest dose (30 mug/20 g i.p.). These data indicate that the Bcl2 pathway is an intracellular target of ADNF-9 and this neuroprotective mechanism of action provides a direction for potential therapeutics against alcohol-induced neural damage during prenatal development.

N2  - The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) describes the continuum of adverse effects that result from prenatal alcohol exposure. Most frequently, prenatal alcohol exposure induces subtle neurochemical and structural changes throughout the brain rather than gross malformations. The consequences of alcohol exposure then manifest in a wide variety of mild to moderate brain dysfunctions in processes such as memory, executive function, attention, and sensory-motor skills. In these studies, children with FASD (male and female, 5-17 years of age) and age- and sex-matched controls performed a series of structured eye movement tasks and/or a visually-guided reaching task in a robotic virtual reality system. The measurement of eye movement control is a powerful tool for assessing sensory, motor and cognitive function, whereas reaching tasks can be used to examine both feedforward and feedback sensory-motor integration. In structured eye movement tasks, children with FASD made many more errors in tasks requiring cognitive flexibility, and these increased error rates correlate strongly to deficits in spatial working memory. In a delayed, memory-guided saccade task, children with FASD completed fewer correct trials. Incorrect trials included: sequence errors where the saccades were directed to target locations in the incorrect order; timing errors where the subject initiated a saccadic response before the go signal; and false starts where the subject broke fixation but returned to the central fixation point to restart the task at the go signal. In the visually-guided reaching task, children with FASD differed from controls in many task outcome measures, specifically those measures related to the initial motor response and corrective responses. In particular, large effect sizes were observed for outcome measures related to the first (initial) movement (e.g., distance and direction error), the total movement path length relative to the optimal path length, and the ratio of the first sub-movement distance to total movement distance. These data suggest that children with FASD have difficulty integrating sensory information into planned motor movements. In summary, eye movement and bilateral reaching tasks can be coupled with novel technologies to create an integrated platform of non-invasive, neurobehavioural tasks that can be used to identify and objectively quantify functional deficits in children with FASD.

N2  - Preface: Alcohol drinking during pregnancy is dangerous for health of both the mother and the baby. In Russia drinking during pregnancy is not strictly prohibited, and even it is often considered quite harmless by close environment of the woman and by herself. The goal of our research is the consideration of the drinking by pregnant women learning the example of situation in Nizhny Novgorod region, Russia. Methods: The grant questionnaire 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention in Russia' developed by research FAS group [1] was used as a basic method. The self-reports of women were analyzed. We have questioned 150 pregnant women of 18-44 years old and analyzed the frequency of alcohol drinking of different types during pregnancy and 3 mouths before it. Results: In the issue the following data was obtained: the most of the woman reduce drinking during pregnancy, but a lot of pregnant woman are at risk zone. Conclusion: Drinking in any rate is a problem for public health in Russia. There is no "safe rate drinking" and the period for drinking during pregnancy. All drinks containing alcohol can harm the baby. Total abstinence of pregnant women is the objective of Russian public health development.

N2  - Introduction: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is dangerous for any woman and her unborn child. In Russia, alcohol consumption during pregnancy is not strictly prohibited, and it is often considered to be harmless by pregnant women and by the general public. A study in the Nizhny Novgorod region of Russia in 2004/2005 measured alcoholic drinking rates for women during pregnancy and during the three months prior to pregnancy. Method: The questionnaire used in the grant, 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention in Russia', developed by the research FAS group [1] was used as a basic method. In the FAS group's study, 648 women were included. Of these women, 155 pregnant women (ages of 18 to 44) were interviewed. Drinking habits were self-reported by involved participants. Frequency analysis was used as the method of analysis. Significance of differences was measured by Student T-test. Results: During the three months before pregnancy, drinking of 7 or more alcohol doses per week and 4 or more doses at a time was found to be common for 50% of women. Of these women, 34% of women consumed these levels of alcohol less often than once per month, 10% of women consumed once per month, 3% consumed two-three times monthly, and 4% consumed once per week. Women drinking 7 or more alcoholic doses per week and binge drinking were found to believe that lower quantities of spirits were harmful during pregnancy and that fewer amounts of alcoholic doses could be considered hard drinking during this time than drinking women in the not-at-risk group (differences are reliable at a rate of 0.01). During pregnancy, drinking rates were found to be lower-no women drinking 7 or more alcoholic doses per week or binge drinking; however, 1 to 3 doses weekly were still imbibed by 23.5 % of pregnant women. Conclusion: Drinking in any rate is a problem for public health in Russia. It is known that there are no safe drinking rates during pregnancy and it doesn't depend on spirit type or frequency of consumption-which is the foundation for why women are at risk of damaging their own health and health of the unborn child. All alcoholic drinks can harm the baby, yet there is still a prevalence of drinking, including drinking in high quantities, among pregnant women in Russia.

N2  - Objectives: Folic acid (FOL) is concentrated in the fetal circulation by the placenta so that cord levels are higher than maternal levels. FOL is also required for detoxification of formic acid(FA), the toxic metabolite of methanol that has recently been observed in cord blood of infants born to alcohol-using mothers (Kapur BM et al. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 2009;33:134A). The objectives of this study was to determine if FOL transport to the fetus is decreased after heavy alcohol exposure and therefore the ability to detoxify FA is compromised. This may contribute to deficits observed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Folate was measured in maternal and cord blood from alcohol-abusing mothers and controls. Results: The fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was = 1.0 in half of the alcohol-exposed pairs (n = 12), whereas all of the controls were > 1.0 (n = 8). Mean folate in cord samples was lower in alcohol-exposed than in the controls (25.83 +/- 13.58 vs 44.04 +/- 10.86, p < 0.01). There was a significant correlation between the control maternal and cord folate levels (p < 0.05) whereas the alcohol group correlation was not significant. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that FOL transport to the fetus is compromised in pregnancies affected by alcohol-abuse. This supports our hypothesis that FA may indeed be a significant contributor in the etiology of FASD, and, that FOL as part of treatment to mitigate its effects need to be investigated.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure causes a collection of permanent physiological, and neurobehavioral deficits termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The timing and amount of exposure cannot fully explain the substantial variability among affected individuals, pointing to unelucidated genetic influences on individual vulnerability to alcohol effects. We investigated the role of genetic influences by administering ethanol (E), pair-fed (PF), or control (C) diets to pregnant dams of the outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) and inbred Brown Norway (BN) rat strains after they were mated with their own or with the other strain. The dams' plasma levels of free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), free T3 (fT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured to elucidate potential differences in their maternal thyroid hormonal environment, which is known to affect the neurobehavioral outcome of FASD. SD and BN dams exhibited different baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) function and SD dams were more severely affected by alcohol consumption. We then compared the bodyweight and placental weight of E, PF, and C offspring of each fetal strain on gestational day 21 (G21). The degree of fetal bodyweight decrease after alcohol exposure was modulated by the genetic contribution of both parents, while alcohol increased placental weight in all of the strains. Additional C, PF, and E offspring of reciprocal SD/BN crosses were allowed to develop into adulthood. E-exposed offspring exhibited two types of behavioral effects: dependent and independent of the parental strains. The two reciprocal crosses were differentially susceptible to an E-induced deficit in social behavior just as the E-consuming SD mother was more susceptible to thyroid hormone alterations. In contrast, E-induced memory deficits were consistent across the reciprocal crosses, suggesting a possible mechanistic link to strain-independent effects of alcohol such as placental enlargement. These findings show the utility of a rat model to dissect the neurobehavioral deficits of FASD into those that are strongly influenced by genetic susceptibility/resiliency, and others that probably arise from robust effects of the environmental insult itself.

N2  - Background: Recent surveys of physicians in Russia demonstrated limited knowledge about Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and lack of experience related to FASD prevention and interventions. Information on FAS, risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies, and brief interventions (BI) was not included in the medical school curriculum or in required Continuing Medical Education (CME) courses. The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate an FASD training curriculum for medical professionals in Russia. Methods: FASD Competency-Based Curriculum Development Guide and Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis (CDC, 2004) were adapted and implemented for training of Russian physicians. A pre-post test design in a randomized educational trial was used to determine the effectiveness of training in changing physicians' knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward drinking during pregnancy. OBGs (N = 65) and pediatricians (N = 73) from different regions of Russia were recruited to participate in the study through the CME program at St. Petersburg Pediatric Academy. The physicians were trained in groups by specialty and were randomly assigned to either experimental (a 3-hour FASD module as a part of regular CME program) or control condition (regular CME program without FASD module). A total of 14 groups of physicians were included in the study. Participants' pre-post changes in FASD knowledge, attitudes, and skills were assessed using questionnaires. In addition, OBGs' BI skills were assessed using coded videotapes of role plays with a simulated patient. Results: Pediatricians and OBGs who received FASD training demonstrated significantly improved knowledge about the effects of alcohol on fetal development and less acceptance of alcohol use during pregnancy than physicians who did not receive training. Pediatricians who received training had higher levels of competency in FASD diagnosis. Compared to OBGs assigned to regular CME, OBGs who received training had significantly improved BI skills and higher levels of competency in conducting screening and BI. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a three-hour FASD education module included in CME for pediatricians and OBGs leads to significant changes in physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and skills. Implications for public health and barriers for implementation of screening and BI for FASD prevention in Russia are discussed.

N2  - Many children affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy can not be identified using current diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We are investigating whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene and protein expression may provide reliable diagnostic indicators of maternal drinking during pregnancy as well as prognostic indicators of brain damage predictive of adverse behavioral outcomes in offspring. Pregnant Long-Evans rats consumed either saccharin water or 5% ethanol in saccharin water four hours per day throughout gestation, producing a mean maternal peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. At term, placentas were processed for gene and protein expression. Microarray analysis of > 28,000 genes revealed that the expression of 304 known genes was altered two-fold or greater in placenta from ethanol-consuming dams compared to controls. The genes altered encode proteins associated with CNS development, organ morphogenesis, immunologic responses, endocrine function, ion homeostasis and skeletal, cardiovascular and cartilage development. 2D-PAGE analyses and mass spectroscopy were used to separate and identify placental proteins affected by moderate drinking during pregnancy. To date, at least twenty of 1,181 protein spots are altered in placentas from ethanol-consuming dams. Fourteen of the twenty protein spots have been identified. Some of the identified proteins play critical roles in placental and neural development, toxicity or apoptosis. For example, the PDPC10 protein is involved in vascular morphogenesis and remodeling, an effect that may contribute to ethanol-induced changes in vascular remodeling during neurodevelopment. These results suggest that the expression of a sufficiently large number of placental mRNAs and proteins are altered after moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD. Further, these results provide insights on novel mechanisms of how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function and brain development.

N2  - Background: Russia has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world and increasingly hazardous drinking in young women. Fetal alcohol exposure, including early in pregnancy when a woman may not know she is pregnant, has adverse outcomes. Data on women's alcohol consumption, contraception use, and risk for alcohol exposed pregnancies (AEP) in Russia are limited. This study was designed to collect data for developing prevention of AEP in Russia. Method: Women were recruited at public women's clinics in St. Petersburg (SPB) and the Nizhniy Novgorod Region (NNR). Six hundred forty-eight childbearing age women completed a face-to-face structured interview that assessed alcohol consumption and contraception use. Results: Among nonpregnant women (N = 347), 89% reported consuming alcohol and 65% reported binge drinking in the last three months, including 47% in NNR and 28% in SPB having binges at least once a month; 70% in NNR and 44% in SPB were at-risk for pregnancy1, including 12% in NNR and 9% in SPB who were trying to conceive. These women consumed alcohol at similar rates and amounts as women who were not at-risk for pregnancy; among trying to conceive women, 61% in SPB and 72% in NNR reported binge drinking. There was a significant decline in drinking after pregnancy identification: among pregnant women (N = 301), 20% reported drinking, including 6% in SBP (none in NNR) who reported current binge drinking. Differences in drinking and risk for AEP were identified between women in SPB and NNR. Conclusions: Although Russian women decrease alcohol consumption after pregnancy identification, high levels of consumption were reported in the preconception period. The high proportion of Russian women at risk for AEP constitutes a substantial risk for fetal alcohol exposure early in pregnancy and indicates the importance of primary prevention of AEP. A preconceptional, dual-focused (alcohol use/pregnancy planning/ contraception) intervention targeting women at risk for AEP has significant potential for preventing FASD in Russia.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Alcohol (ethanol) consumption during pregnancy is linked to congenital heart defects associated with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Because reports have linked ethanol (EtOH) exposure with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, we defined whether a similar relationship exists between ethanol and modulation of cardiac cell fate determination by Wnt-beta-catenin signaling. Exposure of pregnant mice during gastrulation on ED 6.75 to a binge-drinking dose of EtOH induced atrioventricular and semi-lunar valve defects, as determined noninvasively on ED15.5 by echocardiography. EtOH exposure of avian embryos suppressed Wnt/beta-catenin modulated Hex (a marker of the primary heart field) and Islet-1 (a marker for the second heart field) gene expression within the cardiogenic crescent. Folic acid supplementation was tested for prevention of EtOH induced birth defects. Upon 30% EtOH exposure in the avian model, culture medium supplementation with FA, with and without myoinositol, resulted in normal expression of the cardiac markers. In the mouse after EtOH exposure, Folate supplementation or FA in combination with myo-Inositol resulted in normal valve development (100%) on ED 15.5 as assessed by echocardiography. In conclusion, Folate supplementation at a high dose of 10.5 mg/kg in diet, or in combination with myoinositol, prevented alcohol potentiation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling allowing normal cardiac gene activation and cardio-genesis.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is reported to be associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in some offspring. One of the concerns of pregnancy in diabetic women is a several-fold increase in birth defects in the offspring. Thus both maternal alcohol consumption and pregnancy in diabetes mellitus (DM) constitute independent risk factors for offspring maldevelopment. DM women are reported to not differ from non DM women in the drinking and smoking behavior. We aimed to determine the effects of potential interaction between acute doses of alcohol and maternal DM during gestation on fetal skeletal development. Mice were made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ) on gestation day (GD) 2. Single doses of 25% v/v of absolute alcohol in saline (0.03 ml/g body weight) was administered (IP) to groups of DM and non-DM animals on GD 7 or 8. One group of DM animals was treated with insulin (SC). Skeletons of GD 18 fetuses were stained with Alizarin redS and Alcian blue. Fetuses of both ethanol and DM group of mice were observed to have a low incidence of skull bones hypoplasia and vertebral defects. Ethanol injection of DM mice on GD 7 resulted in accentuation of DM-related skeletal defects. Treatment on GD 8 resulted in defects of axial and appendicular skeletons differentially. Combination treatment induced markedly poor ossification in about 60% of animals. Alcohol also was found to augment the frequency of supernumerary ribs and sternal anomalies and poor ossification of bones of paws. These data suggest that alcohol affects the developmental processes of mesoderm of embryos of diabetic mouse resulting in augmentation of skeletal malformations.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) account for a high frequency of growth deficiency, birth defects, and neurobehavioral impairment in infants. An ongoing study in Ukraine seeks to determine whether maternal nutrient status interacts with alcohol exposure to influence the risk for FASD. 3,736 pregnant women (mean gestational age 20.4 +/- 7.0 wks) were screened between April 2008 and December 2009 in two regions of Ukraine. 46.4% of the women were taking prenatal vitamins and/or folic acid at the time of screening. 10.9% were taking supplemental iodine. 94.8% of the women reported some alcohol consumption, a proportion that exceeds the U.S. 44.7%) reported consuming alcohol in the month around conception, and 33.3%) reported consuming alcohol in the most recent month of pregnancy. 9.0% reported at least one binge episode of 4 or more drinks in the month around conception, and 7.5% reported at least one binge episode of 4 or more drinks in the most recent month of pregnancy. A sample of screened women who reported frequent or binge drinking and low/unexposed comparison women were recruited into a prospective cohort study of maternal risk factors for alcohol-related pregnancy outcomes. Analysis to date of maternal baseline plasma samples shows that alcohol-exposed women (N=63) had lower Zn and Cu concentrations vs. controls (N=53). Ferritin, Fe, Mg, Ca, ceruloplasmin activity, methyl-donor nutrients (choline, betaine, DMG, folate, Vit B12, and homocysteine), Vit A, E, and indices of oxidative stress and inflammation (TBARS, protein carbonyls, hsCRP) were similar between groups. Regression analyses showed that the absolute oz. of alcohol/drinking day (AADD) in the month around conception was associated with lower plasma Total Radical-trapping Antioxidant Potential (TRAP) and Vit A. AADD in the most recent month of pregnancy was associated with lower Vit B12 and higher ferritin (which may indicate higher body stores of Fe). The low Zn and Cu in ethanol-exposed women and the lower TRAP and higher ferritin related with alcohol consumption may increase oxidative stress and contribute to alcohol-induced teratogenesis. The association of alcohol consumption with lower Vit B12 and Vit A may also contribute to adverse fetal development.

N2  - Introduction: There is a need for more effective assessment and primary prevention programs aimed at accurately measuring and reducing alcohol consumption before conception in underserved, high-risk populations. Health Information Technology (HIT) may serve this purpose; however, the effectiveness of such tools is not known. Methods: We conducted a small-scale randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an adapted web- based alcohol assessment and intervention tool among low- income, non-pregnant women of reproductive age who were receiving WIC services in San Diego County and who reported currently drinking in a binge pattern. Results: A total of 150 binge-drinking participants completed a web- based assessment and were randomly assigned to either receive a personalized feedback intervention OR general health information about alcohol consumption and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Follow-Up assessments on reported alcohol consumption were conducted via telephone at 1- and 2-months post baseline. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 44 and were predominately Hispanic/Latina (44%). At baseline, all respondents reported consuming >3 standard drinks on >1 occasion in the previous month. Outcome was available for 131 participants. The main outcome measure was reduction in number of risky drinking occasions, and did not differ significantly between treatment conditions, (OR 1.200, 95% CI 0.567-2.539, p=0.634). However, over 70% of the participants reported a reduction in risky drinking occasions regardless of treatment condition (Control 43/63, 68%; Experimental 49/68, 72%). Furthermore, after controlling for confounding in a multivariate hierarchical logistic regression model, the estimate of treatment effect reached borderline significance (OR 2.922, 95% CI 0.991-8.613, p=0.052). Discussion: The results of the present study demonstrate that web-based assessment of alcohol consumption among low-income women of reproductive age, as represented by WIC clients, is feasible and acceptable. The findings also suggest that detailed and interactive assessments of alcohol consumption may be sufficient for the reduction of risky drinking within this population and personalized feedback may be more effective for a subset of individuals.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol (ethanol) during pregnancy can cause a spectrum of structural, cognitive and behavioural anomalies termed the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, there is evidence suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the teratogenic mechanism. To determine the extent to which ROS are involved in FASD, CD-I dams were dosed on gestational day (GD) 9 (plug = GD 1) and exposed to ethanol (4, 6 g/kg low and high dose, respectively) or its vehicle, with or without pretreatment with phenylbutylnitrone (PBN), a free radical spin trapping agent previously shown to reduce embryonic ROS formation and embryopathies caused by teratogens like phenytoin and thalidomide. Ethanol caused dose-dependent teratogenesis that was reduced by pretreatment with PBN. Exposure to 4 g/kg ethanol alone decreased crown-rump length (p < 0.05), while exposure to 6 g/kg ethanol alone decreased fetal weight and crown-rump length, and increased the incidences of resorptions, microcephaly and nasal defects (p < 0.05). Pretreatment of dams with PBN (40 mg/kg) followed by ethanol (4 or 6 g/kg) was protective, evidenced by increases in fetal weight and crown rump-length, as well as decreases in the incidences of microcephaly and nasal defects (p < 0.01) compared to dams exposed to ethanol alone. The reduction in ethanol teratogenesis by PBN pretreatment in mice suggests that ROS may contribute to the FASD.

N2  - In order to explore effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on functional lateralization, item tasks measuring preferences of hand, foot, eye, and ear were administered to a sample of 23 children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) compared with typically developing (TD) children. In addition, a dichotic listening task was administered to a subsample of 11 children with FAS and a TD group of comparable age, sex and handedness. The children with FAS were characterized by increased nonright-handedness compared with TD children. No differences were evident for preferential use of foot, eye, or ear. Moreover, children with FAS displayed more right ear extinctions during dichotic listening relative to TD children, indicating a lack of right ear advantage. The results add to findings of decreased manual asymmetry and less left-lateralized speech perception in children with developmental disorders, and are further discussed in relation to the high incidence of callosal abnormalities in alcohol-exposed children. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Objectives: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a significant public health issue with lifelong psychological, emotional and financial costs associated with caring for an affected individual. In 2005, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch developed evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We examined the extent to which prenatal records across Canadian provinces and territories currently integrate key recommendations from these guidelines. Methods: A content analysis of prenatal record forms retrieved from each Canadian province and territory (N=12) was conducted to identify all questions or intervention prompts related to prenatal screening, exposure assessment, counseling or referral for maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Findings were reviewed in relation to recommendations extrapolated from the Canadian guidelines and the FASD literature. Results: All the prenatal record forms contained questions to assess maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. However, the dimensions of alcohol consumption assessed and the format, wording and number of items related to each dimension varied markedly across provinces/territories. Only five prenatal record forms included a validated screening tool to identify risky alcohol drinking behaviour. Most of the forms lacked prompts to encourage providers to intervene or refer pregnant clients with high-risk drinking behaviour. Conclusion: Integration of the Canadian recommendations into Canadian prenatal record forms may be an effective public health strategy for helping identify pregnancies at high risk for alcohol exposure, reducing the incidence of a FASD through appropriate prenatal intervention and referral, and facilitating early diagnosis of a FASD. © Canadian Public Health Association, 2009.

OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive neuropsychological battery, coupled with magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified across the spectrum, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications within the spectrum. The neuropsychological outcomes of the comprehensive neuroimaging study are presented here. METHODS: The study groups included: 1) FAS/Partial FAS; 2) Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed (SE/AE); 3) Neurobehavioral Disorder/Alcohol Exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed by an interdisciplinary team using the FASD 4-Digit Code; and 4) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol. A standardized neuropsychological battery was administered to each child and their primary caregiver by a psychologist. RESULTS: Use of the 4-Digit Code produced three clinically and statistically distinct FASD clinical subgroups. The three subgroups (ND/AE, SE/AE and FAS/PFAS) reflected a linear continuum of increasing neuropsychological impairment and physical abnormality, representing the full continuum of FASD. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders were comparably prevalent across the three FASD groups, and significantly more prevalent than among the Controls. All three FASD subgroups had comparably high levels of prenatal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although ND/AE, SE/AE, and FAS/PFAS are distinct FASD subgroups, these groups are not distinguishable solely by their neuropsychological profiles. While all children within a group shared the same magnitude of neuropsychological impairment, the patterns of impairment showed considerable individual variability. MRI, MRS and fMRI further distinguished these FASD subgroups.

N2  - Alcohol use by pregnant women is a significant public health issue despite well-described risks to the fetus including physical and intellectual growth retardation and malformations. Although clinical studies are limited, they suggest that in utero alcohol exposure also results in significant immune deficiencies in naive neonates. However, little is known about fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) effects on adult infections. Therefore, to determine the long-term effects of FAE on disease susceptibility and the adult immune system, we infected FAE adult mice with influenza virus. In this study, we demonstrate that mice exposed to ethanol during gestation and nursing exhibit enhanced disease severity as well as increased and sustained pulmonary viral titers following influenza virus infection. Secondary exposure to alcohol as an adult further exacerbates these effects. Moreover, we demonstrate that FAE mice have impaired adaptive immune responses, including decreased numbers of virus-specific pulmonary CD8 T cells, a decreased size and frequency of pulmonary B cell foci, and reduced production of influenza-specific Ab following influenza infection. Together, our results suggest that FAE induces significant and long-term defects in immunity and susceptibility to influenza virus infection and that FAE individuals could be at increased risk for severe and fatal respiratory infections.

N2  - This paper highlights gender peculiarities in the neuroscience of alcohol effects and draws attention to emerging problems due to simultaneous exposure to alcohol and environmental factors. All the available gender studies on alcohol show greater severity of alcohol-related damage, including brain damage, in females compared with males. The differences are due to physiological peculiarities that make women more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol. Today the trend to start consuming alcohol at a younger age, together with the growing number of women drinking excessively, is increasing the alcohol-related risks to women's health and justifying the need for better, gender-based studies of alcohol use and abuse. A further aspect to consider in this context is the risk of the occurrence of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders and foetal alcohol syndrome in the offspring of women who drink during pregnancy. Several lines of evidence indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure can influence cell proliferation and differentiation in the central nervous system, causing severe neurotoxicity and permanent birth defects.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Aims: The study researched alcohol consumption and drinking patterns before and during pregnancy. Method: This was a 1 month self report survey of postnatal women from 21 May-22 June 2006. A multiple choice questionnaire was handed out to them on the first or second postnatal day. Results: There were a total of 117 deliveries. The questionnaire was completed by 100 of the 104 women who received it. Before pregnancy, 80% of women reported drinking alcohol; 66% binge drinking. Twenty-eight percent continued consuming alcohol throughout pregnancy. The majority did reduce or stop their alcohol consumption, 7% however did not. Ten percent were drinking more than 2 units per typical day and more than 7 units per week during pregnancy. Four percent was drinking a lot more than this. Nine percent of the total cohort reported binge drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Just over a quarter of women drink alcohol throughout pregnancy. A significant minority of women drink relatively heavily (more than 4 units per occasion and multiple times per week) during pregnancy. Many women do reduce their alcohol use because of the pregnancy, but often only after they become aware of it. In New Zealand there is a real risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. ©NZMA.

N2  - Background: Chronic prenatal alcohol exposure causes a spectrum of deleterious effects in offspring, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and deficits in executive function are prevalent in FASD. The goal of this research was to test the hypothesis that children with FASD exhibit performance deficits in tasks that assess attention, planning and spatial working memory. Methods: Subjects (8-15 years male and female children) with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and age- and sex-matched controls, completed four tasks selected from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTABResults: Compared with age-matched control children (n = 92), subjects with FASD (n = 89) exhibited longer reaction and decision times (effect size range; Cohen's d = .51 to .73), suggesting deficits in attention. Children with FASD demonstrated deficits in planning and spatial working memory that became more pronounced when task difficulty increased. The largest effect size in this study population (Cohen's d = 1.1) occurred in the spatial working memory task. Only one outcome measure revealed differences across the diagnostic subgroups, although all groups were different from control. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that deficits in multiple executive function domains, including set shifting, planning and strategy use, attention and spatial working memory, can be assessed in children with FASD using an easy to administer, brief battery of computer-based neuropsychological tasks. The tasks appear to be equally sensitive for brain injury resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol, regardless of the presence of facial dysmorphology. © 2008 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been consistently linked to neurocognitive deficits and structural brain abnormalities in affected individuals. Structural brain abnormalities observed in regions supporting spatial working memory (SWM) may contribute to observed deficits in visuospatial functioning in youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in alcohol-exposed individuals during a SWM task. There were 22 young subjects (aged 10-18 years) with documented histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 10), and age- and sex-matched controls (CON, n = 12). Subjects performed a SWM task during fMRI that alternated between 2-back location matching (SWM) and simple attention (vigilance) conditions. Results: Groups did not differ on task accuracy or reaction time to the SWM condition, although CON subjects had faster reaction times during the vigilance condition (617 millisecond vs. 684 millisecond, p = 0.03). Both groups showed similar overall patterns of activation to the SWM condition in expected regions encompassing bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal lobes and parietal areas. However, ALC subjects showed greater BOLD response to the demands of the SWM relative to the vigilance condition in frontal, insular, superior, and middle temporal, occipital, and subcortical regions. CON youth evidenced less increased brain activation to the SWM relative to the vigilance task in these areas (p < 0.05, clusters > 1,664 mul). These differences remained significant after including Full Scale IQ as a covariate. Similar qualitative results were obtained after subjects taking stimulant medication were excluded from the analysis. Conclusions: In the context of equivalent performance to a SWM task, the current results suggest that widespread increases in BOLD response in youth with FASDs could either indicate decreased efficiency of relevant brain networks, or serve as a compensatory mechanism for deficiency at neural and/or cognitive levels. In context of existing fMRI evidence of heightened prefrontal activation in response to verbal working memory and inhibition demands, the present findings may indicate that frontal structures are taxed to a greater degree during cognitive demands in individuals with FASDs. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) reflects a constellation of congenital abnormalities caused by excess maternal consumption of alcohol. It is likely that interference with embryonic development plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Ethanol-induced apoptosis has been suggested as a causal factor in the genesis of FAS. Mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells are pluripotent cells that differentiate in vitro to cell aggregates termed embryoid bodies (EBs), wherein differentiation capacity and gene expression profile are similar to those of the early embryo. Methods: To investigate the effects of ethanol during differentiation, mES cells were cultured on a gelatin surface in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor which maintains adherent undifferentiated cells or in suspension to promote formation of EBs. All cells were treated (1-6 days) with 80 mM ethanol. The pluripotency and differentiation of mES cells were evaluated by western blotting of stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA-1), transcription factors Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Nanog, using alkaline phosphatase staining. Apoptosis (early to late stages) was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using TdT-mediated biotin-dUTP nick-end labelling assay and fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Results: Ethanol increased apoptosis during in vitro differentiation of mES cells to EBs, whereas undifferentiated cells were not affected. Ethanol exposure also interfered with pluripotency marker patterns causing an upregulation of SSEA-1 under self-renewal conditions. In EBs, ethanol delayed the downregulation of SSEA-1 and affected the regulation of transcription factors during differentiation. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that ethanol may contribute to the pathogenesis of FAS by triggering apoptotic pathways during differentiation of embryonic stem cells and deregulating early stages of embryogenesis. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a range of disabilities caused by gestational exposure to alcohol. FASD is the leading cause of preventable mental retardation and developmental disability in the United States, with an incidence of 1-10 per 1000 live births. FASD in Israel has yet to be examined systematically. Objectives: To evaluate professionals' experience, awareness and knowledge of FASD in Israel and their awareness of maternal consumption of alcohol, and to collect epidemiological data on the syndrome in Israel. Methods: A short questionnaire was sent to all 43 program directors of genetic institutes (n=14) and child developmental centers in Israel (n=29). Four questions related to their experience and knowledge of FASD. The epidemiological survey included data from all 17 hospitals in Israel and from the two main health management organizations within the public health care system. Results: The response rate was 98% (n=42). A total of 38.1% of respondents reported having diagnosed at least one case of FASD and fewer than 10% of respondents stated that the knowledge regarding FASD among physicians in Israel was adequate. Developmental pediatricians were more likely to have diagnosed at least one case as compared to geneticists. During the period 1998-2007 the diagnosis of FASD appeared in the records of only 4 patients from the total number of 17 hospitals in Israel. During the same period only six patients were diagnosed at the HMO within the public health care system. Conclusions: Despite the accumulated knowledge on FASD in many countries and the increase in alcohol consumption in Israel, professionals' awareness of its potential damage is limited. Educational programs to increase physician awareness should accompany publicity campaigns warning the public of the dangers associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Both executive function deficits and slower processing speed are characteristic of children with fetal alcohol exposure, but the temporal dynamics of neural activity underlying cognitive processing deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder have rarely been studied. To this end, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to examine the nature of alcohol-related effects on response inhibition by identifying differences in neural activation during task performance. Methods: We recorded ERPs during a Go/No-go response inhibition task in 2 groups of children in Cape Town, South Africa (M age = 11.7 years; range = 10 to 13) - one diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (FAS/PFAS; n = 7); the other, a control group whose mothers abstained or drank only minimally during pregnancy (n = 6). Children were instructed to press a "Go" response button to all letter stimuli presented except for the letter "X," the "No-go" stimulus, which occurred relatively infrequently. Results: Task performance accuracy and reaction time did not differ between groups, but differences emerged for 3 ERP components - P2, N2, and P3. The FAS/PFAS group showed a slower latency to peak P2, suggesting less efficient processing of visual information at a relatively early stage (~200 ms after stimulus onset). Moreover, controls showed a larger P2 amplitude to Go versus No-go, indicating an early discrimination between conditions that was not seen in the FAS/PFAS group. Consistent with previous literature on tasks related to cognitive control, the control group showed a well-defined, larger N2 to No-go versus Go, which was not evident in the FAS/PFAS group. Both groups showed the expected larger P3 amplitude to No-go versus Go, but this condition difference persisted in a late slow wave for the FAS/PFAS group, suggesting increased cognitive effort. Conclusions: The timing and amplitude differences in the ERP measures suggest that slower, less efficient processing characterizes the FAS/PFAS group during initial stimulus identification. Moreover, the exposed children showed less sharply defined components throughout the stimulus and response evaluation processes involved in successful response inhibition. Although both groups were able to inhibit their responses equally well, the level of neural activation in the children with FAS/PFAS was greater, suggesting more cognitive effort. The specific deficits in response inhibition processing at discrete stages of neural activation may have implications for understanding the nature of alcohol-related deficits in other cognitive domains as well. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Several studies have now shown corpus callosum abnormalities using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in comparison with nonexposed controls. The data suggest that posterior regions of the callosum may be disproportionately affected. The current study builds on previous efforts, including our own work, and moves beyond midline corpus callosum to probe major inter-hemispheric white matter pathways with an improved DTI tractographic method. This study also expands on our prior work by evaluating a larger sample and by incorporating children with a broader range of clinical effects including full-criteria fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Methods: Participants included 33 children with FASD (8 FAS, 23 partial FAS, 2 static encephalopathy) and 19 nonexposed controls between the ages of 10 and 17 years. Participants underwent DTI scans and intelligence testing. Groups (FASD vs. controls) were compared on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in 6 white matter tracts projected through the corpus callosum. Exploratory analyses were also conducted examining the relationships between DTI measures in the corpus callosum and measures of intellectual functioning and facial dysmorphology. Results: In comparison with the control group, the FASD group had significantly lower FA in 3 posterior tracts of the corpus callosum: the posterior mid-body, the isthmus, and the splenium. A trend-level finding also suggested lower FA in the genu. Measures of white matter integrity and cognition were correlated and suggest some regional specificity, in that only posterior regions of the corpus callosum were associated with visual-perceptual skills. Correlations between measures of facial dysmorphology and posterior regions of the corpus callosum were nonsignificant. Conclusions: Consistent with previous DTI studies, these results suggest that microstructural posterior corpus callosum abnormalities are present in children with prenatal alcohol exposure and cognitive impairment. These abnormalities are clinically relevant because they are associated with cognitive deficits and appear to provide evidence of abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure independent of dysmorphic features. As such, they may yield important diagnostic and prognostic information not provided by the traditional facial characteristics. Copyright © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Binge drinking during pregnancy might lead to the development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in the offspring. Latinas are often considered a low-risk group for alcohol abuse, although recent reports indicate that the prevalence of alcohol consumption in this group is increasing due to changing cultural norms. The predictors of alcohol consumption during pregnancy among Latinas are largely unknown. We explored predictors of periconceptional drinking among Latinas (n = 155) recruited into an ongoing cohort study at the University of New Mexico. Women were interviewed by a bilingual trained interviewer about any episodes of binge drinking (>4 drinks/occasion) a month around their last menstrual period (LMP) and were administered a TWEAK questionnaire. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and reproductive health characteristics were also ascertained. Predictors of binge drinking were identified by Chi-square test and logistic regression in univariate and multivariable analyses, respectively. Backward selection procedure was used to identify covariates that were independently associated with binge drinking in the final model. The mean age of participants was 27.0 +/- 5.8 years and 69% were foreign born. In the entire sample, 17.4% of pregnant Latinas admitted at least one binge-drinking episode in the month around their LMP. Results of multivariate analysis indicate that Latinas born in the United States have a much greater risk of binge drinking in the periconceptional period (odds ratio [OR] = 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 8.9) compared with foreign-born Latinas. Similarly, Latinas who primarily speak English at home were at much greater risk (OR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 10.5) compared with primarily Spanish-speaking women. No other variables were identified as significant predictors in multivariable models. Our results indicate that more acculturated Latinas are at much greater risk of binge drinking before conception and in early pregnancy compared with less acculturated Latinas. Culturally sensitive interventions should be developed to address risky alcohol consumption among Latinas of reproductive age. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - The role of alcohol in the causation of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) has been firmly established. In most cases events leading to its occurrence have been set into motion prior to conception. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the sole causative agent of FAS, can therefore be prevented even prior to conception by implementation of preconception counseling (PCC). The present review examines the important issues involved in the implementation of PCC for the prevention of FAS which can be of immense help to the affected population.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at microscopic levels, provides unprecedented opportunities to aid in defining the full spectrum of ethanol's insult to the developing brain. This is the first in a series of reports that, collectively, will provide an MRM-based atlas of developmental stage-dependent structural brain abnormalities in a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) mouse model. The ethanol exposure time and developmental stage examined for this report is gestational day (GD) 8 in mice, when the embryos are at early neurulation stages; stages present in humans early in the fourth week postfertilization. Methods: For this study, pregnant C57Bl/6J mice were administered an ethanol dosage of 2.8 g/kg intraperitoneally at 8 days, 0 hour and again at 8 days, 4 hours postfertilization. On GD 17, fetuses that were selected for MRM analyses were immersion fixed in a Bouin's/Prohance solution. Control fetuses from vehicle-treated dams were stage-matched to those that were ethanol-exposed. The fetal mice were scanned ex vivo at 7.0 T and 512 x 512 x 1024 image arrays were acquired using 3-D spin warp encoding. The resulting 29 mum (isotropic) resolution images were processed using ITK-SNAP, a 3-D segmentation/ visualization tool. Linear and volume measurements were determined for selected brain, head, and body regions of each specimen. Comparisons were made between control and treated fetuses, with an emphasis on determining (dis)proportionate changes in specific brain regions. Results: As compared with controls, the crown-rump lengths of stage-matched ethanol-exposed GD 17 fetuses were significantly reduced, as were brain and whole body volumes. Volume reductions were notable in every brain region examined, with the exception of the pituitary and septal region, and were accompanied by increased ventricular volumes. Disproportionate regional brain volume reductions were most marked on the right side and were significant for the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum; the latter being the most severely affected. Additionally, the septal region and the pituitary were disproportionately large. Linear measures were consistent with those of volume. Other dysmorphologic features noted in the MR scans were choanal stenosis and optic nerve coloboma. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that exposure to ethanol occurring in mice at stages corresponding to the human fourth week postfertilization results in structural brain abnormalities that are readily identifiable at fetal stages of development. In addition to illustrating the utility of MR microscopy for analysis of an FASD mouse model, this work provides new information that confirms and extends human clinical observations. It also provides a framework for comparison of structural brain abnormalities resulting from ethanol exposure at other developmental stages and dosages. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this pilot study was to explore possible ultrasound parameters for the early detection of alcohol-mediated fetal somatic and central nervous system (CNS) maldevelopment. Maternal alcohol ingestion during pregnancy may lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which encompass a broad range of structural abnormalities including growth impairment, specific craniofacial features and CNS abnormalities. Early detection of fetuses at risk of FASD would support earlier interventions. Methods: We performed a longitudinal prospective pilot study from 2004 to 2006 at two sites in Ukraine. A sample of pregnant women who reported consuming moderate-to-heavy amounts of alcohol participated in a comprehensive maternal interview, and received ultrasound evaluation of fetal growth and specific fetal brain measurements during the second and third trimesters. These measurements were compared with those collected from a group of pregnant women who consumed little-to-no alcohol during pregnancy, and who were recruited and followed in the same manner. Results: From 6745 screened women, 84 moderate-to-heavy alcohol users and 82 comparison women were identified and ultrasound examinations performed. After controlling for maternal smoking, alcohol-exposed fetuses had shorter mean femur length, caval-calvarial distance and frontothalamic measurements in the second trimester (P < 0.05), and alcohol-exposed fetuses also had shorter frontothalamic distance measurements in the third trimester relative to comparison fetuses (P < 0.05). In addition, after controlling for maternal smoking, both mean orbital diameter and biparietal diameter measurements were significantly smaller on average in the alcohol-exposed group in the third trimester relative to comparison fetuses (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Significant differences in selected somatic and brain measurements were noted between alcoholexposed and comparison fetuses, suggesting these markers may be further explored for clinical utility in prenatal identification of affected children. Further study correlating these findings with alcohol-related physical features of the newborn and subsequent comparisons of neurodevelopmental outcomes will help define potential uses of prenatal ultrasound for intervention and prevention of FASD.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), resulting from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, are associated with significant academic and behavior problems. Although affected children are common in clinical practice, information to guide recommendations about interventions with this high risk group is very limited. This study evaluated the persistence of effects of an intervention on the math performance and behavior of 54 children, 3- to 10-years, diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome or FASD. METHODS: Children were randomly assigned to a 6-week Math intervention (n = 28) tailored to this clinical group or to a standard psychoeducational contrast group (n = 26). All caregivers received identical educational interventions to promote learning readiness and improve behavioral outcomes. In a previous study, participants were assessed before interventions and immediately following completion. In this follow-up study, participants were recontacted and reassessed at 6 months post completion to determine if positive results on math functioning and child behavior would persist after treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: Focus was on 2 outcomes: (1) Math performance, assessed using standardized measures of math achievement and (2) Behavior problems as reported by caregivers on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teachers on the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Experimental-group participants demonstrated significantly greater scores on math outcome measures than Contrast group members and CBCL and TRF behavior was improved over pretest scores in both groups. CONCLUSION: This 6-month follow-up confirms that both math skills and behavior of alcohol-affected children are improved significantly by interventions designed to meet their specific learning and behavior needs. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - This study evaluated the neural basis of verbal working memory (WM) function in a group of 20 children and adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) and 20 typically developing comparison participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both groups showed prominent activation in the frontal-parietal-cerebellar network known to be important for verbal WM. Despite equivalent behavioral performance between groups, alcohol-exposed individuals showed increased activation relative to typically developing individuals in left dorsal frontal and left inferior parietal cortices, and bilateral posterior temporal regions during verbal WM. These effects remained even when group differences on IQ were statistically controlled. This pattern of increased activation coupled with equivalent behavioral performance between groups suggests that individuals with FASD recruit a more extensive network of brain regions during verbal WM relative to typically developing individuals. These findings may suggest that frontal-parietal processing during verbal WM is less effi-cient in alcohol-exposed individuals. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance (MR) technology offers noninvasive methods for in vivo assessment of neuroabnormalities. Methods: A comprehensive neuropsychological/psychiatric battery, coupled with MR imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) assessments, were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the spectrum. The 4 study groups included: (i) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (PFAS); (ii) static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed (SE/AE); (iii) neurobehavioral disorder/alcohol exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed with the FASD 4-Digit Code; and (iv) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure. Presented here are the MRI assessments that were used to compare the sizes of brain regions between the 4 groups. The neuropsychological/behavioral, MRS, and fMRI outcomes are reported separately. Results: Progressing across the 4 study groups from Controls to ND/AE to SE/AE to FAS/PFAS, the mean absolute size of the total brain, frontal lobe, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, cerebellar vermis, and corpus callosum length decreased incrementally and significantly. The FAS/PFAS group (the only group with the 4-Digit FAS facial phenotype) had disproportionately smaller frontal lobes relative to all other groups. The FAS/PFAS and SE/AE groups [the 2 groups with the most severe central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction] had disproportionately smaller caudate regions relative to the ND/AE and Control groups. The prevalence of subjects in the FAS/PFAS, SE/AE, and ND/AE groups that had 1 or more brain regions, 2 or more SDs below the mean size observed in the Control group was 78, 58, and 43%, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between size of brain regions and level of prenatal alcohol exposure, magnitude of FAS facial phenotype, and level of CNS dysfunction. Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging provided further validation that ND/AE, SE/AE, and FAS/PFAS as defined by the FASD 4-Digit Code are 3 clinically distinct and increasingly more affected diagnostic subclassifications under the umbrella of FASD. Neurostructural abnormalities are present across the spectrum. MRI could importantly augment diagnosis of conditions under the umbrella of FASD, once population-based norms for structural development of the human brain are established.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Clinical studies and research in animals have established that alcohol consumption during pregnancy produces irreversible developmental anomalies. Deficits in fine motor performance are often noted in infants diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. However, the effects of alcohol on the spinal motoneurons have not been examined. In this study, the morphometric alterations in spinal motoneurons were assessed as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered with 1.0 ml of 20% ethyl alcohol per 100 gm body weight via intraperitoneal injections, and unexposed rats served as controls. Rats were perfused through the left cardiac ventricle and a complete laminectomy was performed. Spinal cord sections from the L4-5 segments were cut serially and stained for cresyl fast violet. Sections were also subjected to TUNEL assay for detection of apoptosis. Observations were made between 1 and 4 weeks after birth. RESULTS: Morphologic characteristics of motoneurons in the alcoholexposed group of rats were altered. Counts and measurements revealed significant reduction in number and size of alcohol-exposed spinal motoneurons at all time points studied. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to alcohol showed cytotoxic effects whereby it adversely affected both motoneuron growth and differentiation in utero. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Despite decades of research, the aetiology of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD) remains largely unknown. Next to a strong genetic component, increasing evidence suggests additional adverse impact of environmental factors, two of which have, although controversially, withstood meta-analysis: gestational exposure to smoking (OR 2.39) and low birth weight (OR 2.64). Several studies have investigated a possible association between prenatal exposure to alcohol and ADHD, although the matter is complicated due to foetal alcohol syndrome disorders (FASD) with ADHD-like symptoms. Questions: Can an estimate of the effect of gestational exposure to alcohol for ADHD be determined? What is the relevance of primary care services in screening and intervention in mild to moderate drinking in pregnant women? Method: MEDLINE, Cinahl, PsychInfo, EMBASE (1995-2008) were searched for articles in English, supplemented by a manual search. Out of 23 reviewed studies, three were included in the meta-analysis; one further study was added to undertake a sub-analysis comparing severe versus mild alcohol consumption. Summary odds ratios (OR) were extracted and fixed/random-effects meta-analysis were used for combining the OR's. Heterogeneity across the studies was formally assessed using Cochran's Q. Results: An OR of 2.33 (95% CI, 1.18-4.61), (z = 2.43, p = 0.02) suggests that exposed children are 2.33 times more likely to have ADHD than non exposed children. Discussion: Our meta-analysis suggests that children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy are at risk for ADHD. However, evidence is sparse and it remains uncertain whether a causal association exists. Further research is needed into dose-response relationship, timing of exposure, influence of genetic factors involved inmaternal alcohol abuse and the role of FASD in ADHD-like symptoms. If a detrimental effect of mild to moderate drinking on the offspring is supported by stronger evidence, primary care services could have a major role in prevention and early intervention. This would be in addition to their already established role in helping heavy drinking mothers. © 2009 Royal College of General Practitioners.

N2  - Background: Previous research has demonstrated that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure affects the size and shape of the corpus callosum (CC) and compromises interhemispheric transfer of information. The aim of this study was to confirm the previous reports of poorer performance on a finger localization test (FLT) of interhemispheric transfer in a cohort of heavily exposed children and to extend these findings to a cohort of moderately exposed young adults. Methods: In Study 1, the FLT was administered to 40 heavily exposed and 23 nonexposed children from the Cape Coloured community of Cape Town, South Africa, who were evaluated for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) dysmorphology and growth. Anatomical images of the CC were obtained using structural MRI on a subset of these children. In Study 2, the FLT was administered to a cohort of 85 moderate-to-heavily exposed young adults participating in a 19-year follow-up assessment of the Detroit Prenatal Alcohol Exposure cohort, whose alcohol exposure had been ascertained prospectively during gestation. Results: In Study 1, children with FAS showed more transfer-related errors than controls after adjustment for confounding, and increased transfer-related errors were associated with volume reductions in the isthmus and splenium of the CC. In Study 2, transfer-related errors were associated with quantity of alcohol consumed per occasion during pregnancy. More errors were made if the mother reported binge drinking (>5 standard drinks) during pregnancy than if she drank regularly (M > 1 drink/day) without binge drinking. Conclusions: These findings confirm a previous report of impaired interhemispheric transfer of tactile information in children heavily exposed to alcohol in utero and extend these findings to show that these deficits are also seen in more moderately exposed individuals, particularly those exposed to binge-like pregnancy drinking. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Exposure to ethanol during prenatal development can have devastating consequences on developing fetuses, the so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disordres (FASD). Among FASD, cases that exhibit all of three criterion; 1) central nervous system dysfunction, 2) prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and 3) characteristic cranial/facial abnormalities, referred as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children born to drinking mothers may suffer from severe brain damage that is expressed by a variety of behavioral alterations. We examined the effects of ethanol exposure during brain development on brain morphogenesis and circadian rhythm using a rat model. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a liquid diet containing 2.5-5.0% (w/v) ethanol during gestational days 10 to 21. Mean daily ethanol consumption by these dams was 11.53 +/- 2.54 g/kg/day. In rats prenatally exposed to ethanol, ectopias on the cerebral cortex, aberrant distribution of hippocampal mossy fibers, and fusion of cerebellar folia were found. Rats exposed to ethanol during the prenatal or postnatal period suffered from a fragile synchronizing system of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Although the prevalence of FAS in Japan is lower than in the United States, the increasing number of Japanese women with the drinking habit are cause for great concern. However, the preventive action of FAS/FASD has been advanced recently, and now alcoholic beverages carry labels warning of the risk of drinking during pregnancy and breastfeeding of babies. Although little is still known about how ethanol affects brain development, the only and most certain way to prevent FAS/FASD is total abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. To describe the clinical features of American Indian children born just before and just after a sibling with fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome. METHODS. Two retrospective case-control studies were conducted of Northern Plains American Indian children with fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome identified from 1981 to 1993 by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 760.71. RESULTS. Compared with the controls, the 39 siblings born just before children with fetal alcohol syndrome (study 1) and 30 siblings born just before children with incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome (study 2) had more facial dysmorphology (23.1% and 16.7%, respectively), growth delay (38.5% and 10.0%), and central nervous system impairment (48.7% and 33.3%). The 20 siblings born just after children with fetal alcohol syndrome (study 1) and 22 siblings born just after children with incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome (study 2) had more facial dysmorphology (20.0% and 9.1%, respectively), growth delay (45.0% and 22.7%), and central nervous system impairment (50.0% and 31.8%) than the control siblings.CONCLUSIONS. The "before" siblings had characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome that could have predicted that the next child was at risk for fetal alcohol syndrome. The "after" siblings had better outcomes than the previous siblings with fetal alcohol syndrome, a finding that was associated with a decrease in maternal alcohol consumption during the after-sibling pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of fetal alcohol exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability in the first one and a half years of life. Four models describing the interplay of these factors were assessed: A direct effect model, an interaction or threshold model, a mediational model and a transactional model. Method: A sample of initially 458 women was assessed in a prospective 3-wave study across the first 17 months after childbirth. Fetal alcohol exposure was questioned retrospectively six weeks after birth. Infant irritability was reported by the mothers and fathers. Results: Support for the direct effect model and the interaction model could be found: Fetal alcohol exposure and low emotional support from the husband were associated with increased infant irritability at 5 months. The impact of fetal alcohol exposure was moderated by postnatal depressive symptoms. More irritability was reported if both risk factors, prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal depressive symptoms, were present. Infant irritability and maternal depressive symptoms were associated cross-sectionally. At the age of 17 months only a main effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on irritability could be found. Conclusion: Direct effects of fetal alcohol exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability as well as an interaction between fetal alcohol exposure and maternal depressive symptoms were revealed. The interaction can be understood in terms of a diathesis-stress model. However, no longitudinal associations between maternal depressive symptoms and infant irritability could be found. © 2009 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs), including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, continue to be high-incidence developmental disorders. Detection of patterns of maternal drinking that place fetuses at risk for these disorders is critical to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, but is challenging and often insufficient during pregnancy. Various screens and measures have been used to identify maternal risk drinking but their ability to predict child outcome has been inconsistent. This study hypothesized that a metric of fetal "at-risk" alcohol exposure (ARAE) derived from several indicators of maternal self-reported drinking would predict alcohol-related neurobehavioral dysfunctions in children better than individual measures of maternal alcohol consumption alone. Methods: Self-reported peri-conceptional and repeated maternal drinking during pregnancy were assessed with semi-structured interviews and standard screens, i.e., the CAGE, T-ACE, and MAST, in a prospective sample of 75 African-American mothers. Drinking volumes per beverage type were converted to standard quantity and frequency measures. From these individual measures and screening instruments, a simple dichotomous index of prenatal ARAE was defined and used to predict neurobehavioral outcomes in the 4- to 5-year-old offspring of these women. Study outcomes included IQ, attention, memory, visual-motor integration, fine motor skill, and behavior. Statistical analyses controlled for demographic and other potential confounders. Results: The current "at-risk" drinking metric identified over 62% of the mothers as drinking at risk levels - 23% more than the selection criterion identified - and outperformed all individual quantity and frequency consumption measures, including averages of weekly alcohol use and "binge" alcohol exposures (assessed as intake per drinking occasion), as well as an estimate of the Maternal Substance Abuse Checklist (Coles et al., 2000), in predicting prenatal alcohol-related cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in 4- to 5-year-old children. Conclusions: A metric reflecting multiple indices of "at-risk" maternal alcohol drinking in pregnancy had greater utility in predicting various prenatal alcohol-related neurobehavioral dysfunction and deficits in children compared to individual measures of maternal self-reported alcohol consumption or a previous maternal substance abuse index. Assessing fetal risk drinking in pregnant women was improved by including multiple indicators of both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences and, if appropriate practical applications are devised, may facilitate intervention by health care workers during pregnancy and potentially reduce the incidence or severity of FASDs.

N2  - Aim: To identify factors contributing to growth failure in international adoptees (IAs) from Eastern Europe. Study design: 138 IAs from Eastern Europe, 6-59 months old, were evaluated within 3 weeks of US arrival. Complete history, anthropometry, and serum for growth factors were obtained. Facial features were examined for risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. Results: Upon arrival, mean height (-1.23 +/- 1.07), weight (-1.43 +/- 1.29), and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) (-0.63+/-1.10) SDS in las were significantly less than population means for US children. In a multiple regression model, age, low birth weight (LBW), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, and high risk for fetal alcohol syndrome were independent predictors of height SDS. LBW also independently predicted lower weight SDS and smaller OFC SDS. Conclusions: We recommend that IAs undergo screening upon US arrival to identify risk factors for poor growth, particularly evidence of LBW and fetal alcohol exposure. Catch-up growth should be monitored in all children following adoption. © Freund Publishing House Ltd., London.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is the most common environmental factor leading to congenital birth defects in the United States. Although significant progress has been made in this field, the detailed molecular pathology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) remains to be determined. Previously, we have shown that alcohol exposure perturbs hedgehog signal transduction in zebrafish embryos by inhibiting the post-translational cholesterol modification of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), leading to decreased levels of mature Shh ligand that is associated with the plasma membrane, and causing transient loss of Hh signaling, resulting in permanent FAS-related morphological abnormalities. In the present study, we further elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the intracellular transportation and secretion of Shh using the hepatic stellate cell line HSC8B. We have found that Shh is associated with caveolin-1 in the Golgi apparatus to form protein complexes and that these complexes are packaged as large punctuate structures (transport vesicles) that are transported to the plasma membrane in lipid raft microdomains. Alcohol exposure does not significantly interrupt translation of shh mRNA in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the trafficking of Shh from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. However, alcohol does prevent the entry of Shh into transport vesicles from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and specifically decreases the amount of caveolin-1/Shh complex found in lipid rafts, causing cytoplasmic accumulation of Shh and leading to a deficiency of Shh ligand secretion into the extracellular matrix. © 2009 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized by physical deformities and learning and memory deficits. The chick hippocampus, whose functions are controlled by interneurons expressing calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR), is involved in learning and memory mechanisms. Effects on growth and development and hippocampal morphology were studied in chick embryos exposed to 5% and 10% ethanol volume/volume (vol/vol) for 2 or 8 days of gestation. There was a significant dose-dependent reduction (P < .05) in body weight and mean number per section of PV and CR expressing hippocampal neurons in ethanol-exposed chicks, without alterations in neuronal nuclear size or hippocampal volume, compared appropriate controls. Moreover, when chicks exposed to 5% ethanol for 2 and 8 days of gestation were compared, no significant differences were found in body parameters or neuronal counts. Similarly, exposure to 10% ethanol did not induce any significant changes in chicks exposed for 2 or 8 gestational days. Thus, these results suggest that gestational ethanol exposure induces a reduction in the mean number per section of PV and CR expressing hippocampal neurons, and could be a possible mechanism responsible for learning and memory disorders in FAS. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Exposure to alcohol during gestation is associated with CNS alterations, cognitive deficits, and behavior problems. This study investigated microstructural aspects of putative white matter abnormalities following prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess white matter microstructure in 27 youth (age range: 8 to 18 years) with (n = 15) and without (n = 12) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Voxelwise analyses, corrected for multiple comparisons, compared fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between groups, throughout the cerebrum. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with low FA in multiple cerebral areas, including the body of the corpus callosum and white matter innervating bilateral medial frontal and occipital lobes. Fewer between-group differences in MD were observed. Conclusions: These data provide an account of cerebral white matter microstructural integrity in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and support extant literature showing that white matter is a target of alcohol teratogenesis. The white matter anomalies characterized in this study may relate to the neurobehavioral sequelae associated with gestational alcohol exposure, especially in areas of executive dysfunction and visual processing deficits. © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Seizures are often found in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, but it is not known whether binge drinking during pregnancy by nonalcoholic women is associated with an increased risk of seizure disorders in children. The authors conducted a population-based cohort study of 80,526 liveborn singletons in the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996-2002). Information on maternal binge drinking (intake of >5 drinks on a single occasion) was collected in 2 computer-assisted telephone interviews during pregnancy. Children were followed for up to 8 years. Information on neonatal seizures, epilepsy, and febrile seizures was retrieved from the Danish National Hospital Register. Results showed that exposure to binge drinking episodes during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of seizure disorders in children, except for those exposed at 11-16 gestational weeks. These children had a 3.15-fold increased risk of neonatal seizures (95% confidence interval: 1.37, 7.25) and a 1.81-fold increased risk of epilepsy (95% confidence interval: 1.13, 2.90). These findings suggest that maternal binge drinking during a specific time period of pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of specific seizure disorders in the offspring. The results are exploratory, however, and need to be replicated. © The Author 2008. Published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Cell death and differentiations are the critical processes in developing fetal brain, where ethanol induces lots of changes in gene expression patterns of fetal nervous system leading to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The objective of the present study was to observe whether maternal ethanol exposure can alter gene expression pattern in mother and in fetus during mid and late prenatal stage. Material/Methods: 10% ethanol was orally applied to female Spraque-Dawley rats and fetuses were sacrificed on gestational day (GD) 19.5 and 21.5. Total mRNA was isolated for differential-display PCR (DD-PCR) and sequence was analyzed to find out the homologous gene(s) using GenBank database of the BLAST program. Finally, the gene expression pattern in different maternal and fetal brain areas of the control and the ethanol treated groups were studied by RNase protection assay (RPA) and in situ hybridization. Results: Out of several differentially expressed genes, apoptosis-related RNA binding protein (RBP), 'Napor-3' mRNA expression was significantly inhibited by ethanol in fetal rat fore-, mid- and hind- brain, and adult rat cortex and hippocampus when compared with the untreated control. The cDNA analysis was further supported our result (accession: AF090697, 95% sequence homology). Conclusions: The age and area dependent suppression of apoptosis-related RBP, Napor-3 gene expression in proliferating fetal brain by maternal ethanol suggesting high susceptibility towards ethanol intake at the time of neuronal cell development and proliferation. Further, ethanol also affects maternal brain tissues that may be one of the reasons for ethanol-induce irreversible damage of the developing brain. The present study for the first time provides the evidence that Napor-3 suppression by ethanol during mid and late stage fetal brain converts natural physiological event apoptosis into pathological process, which may be useful as a novel therapeutic approach towards FAS-associated developmental brain damage as a consequence of maternal drinking behavior. © Med Sci Monit, 2009.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Mediators of susceptibility to alcohol-related toxicity in the prenatal environment are relatively unknown. The placenta has been proposed as a potential source of variability in the fetal environment, primarily through its significant metabolic capabilities. Meconium is a toxicological matrix unique to the developing fetus that offers an opportunity to quantify fetal exposure to alcohol through the analysis of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) [nonoxidative ethanol metabolites]. Objective: To explore the role of the placenta as a potential source of variability in mediating fetal alcohol exposure via meconium analysis of FAEE, by combining a clinical case report involving human dizygotic twins and a series of guinea pig littermates. Methods: Meconium was collected from a pair of dizygotic twins with clinical suspicion of prenatal alcohol exposure and analyzed for FAEE to confirm prenatal alcohol exposure. Meconium was also collected from a series of guinea pig pups prenatally exposed to alcohol at a daily dose of 4 g/kg/day administered to the pregnant dam. FAEE levels were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection following liquid-liquid extraction from meconium. Results: The dizygotic twin pair yielded positive meconium FAEE results (>2.00 nmoL/g) in the female twin (2.21 nmoL/g) and no detectable FAEE in the male twin. A total of 15 meconium samples were collected from 15 pups of five pregnant guinea pig litters. With the exception of one pair of littermates, meconium FAEE concentrations differed substantially within each litter (FAEE expressed in units of nmoL/g): litter 1 (0.996, 4.43, 1.36); litter 2 (5.17, 4.15, 0.00); litter 3 (5.16, 5.27); litter 4 (18.57, 8.26, 7.46); litter 5 (0.00, 4.32, 0.00, 1.27). Conclusions: Identical maternal ethanol exposure levels produced differing levels of fetal exposure in a dizygotic human twin pair and a series of guinea pig littermates as evidenced through FAEE meconium analysis. These data indicate that the placenta may have a previously unappreciated role in mediating ethanol-induced fetal injury. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)is the leading cause of mental retardation worldwide but is also the foremost preventable cause of neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities. It is equally important to know spectrum of disorders due to maternal alcoholism during pregnancy such as Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD)in order to identify and treat affected child and family effectively. This article aims to create awareness among practising clinicians most of whom are only aware of phenotypical variant of FASD which is FAS.In this article we discuss those aspects of FASD relevant to the clinician such as: terminological ambiguity, assessment, diagnosis and prevention. © 2009 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a major cause of mental retardation in Western countries. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is mainly characterized by pre- and postnatal stunted growth, neurocognitive disorders, and facial dysmorphism. It compromises the intellectual and behavioral prognosis of the child. Prevention tools exist, through better information of health professionals, for optimal care of high-risk women before, during, and after pregnancy, which would decrease the incidence of SAF in the future. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

T1  - GSK3beta in ethanol neurotoxicity
A1  - Luo J.
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health problem and may result in a wide range of adverse outcomes for the child. The developing central nervous system (CNS) is particularly susceptible to ethanol toxicity. Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments. FASD currently represents the leading cause of mental retardation in North America ahead of Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Ethanol exposure during development causes multiple abnormalities in the brain such as permanent loss of neurons, ectopic neurons, and alterations in synaptogenesis and myelinogenesis. These alcohol-induced structural alterations in the developing brain underlie many of the behavioral deficits observed in FASD. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of ethanol neurotoxicity, however, remain unclear. Ethanol elicits cellular stresses, including oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, responds to various cellular stresses. GSK3beta is particularly abundant in the developing CNS, and regulates diverse developmental events in the immature brain, such as neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, migration, and survival. Available evidence indicates that the activity of GSK3beta in the CNS is affected by ethanol. GSK3beta inhibition provides protection against ethanol neurotoxicity, whereas high GSK3beta activity/expression sensitizes neuronal cells to ethanol-induced damages. It appears that GSK3beta is a converging signaling point that mediates some of ethanol's neurotoxic effects. © 2009 Humana Press Inc.

N2  - Magnetic resonance (MR) technology offers noninvasive methods for in vivo assessment of neuroabnormalities. A comprehensive neuropsychological/behavioral, MR imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS) and functional MRI (fMRI) assessment was administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine whether global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified and to distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the spectrum. The four study groups included (1) FAS/partial FAS; (2) static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed (SE/AE); (3) neurobehavioral disorder/alcohol exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed with the FASD 4-Digit Code; and (4) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure. Results are presented in four separate reports: MRS (reported here) and neuropsychological/behavioral, MRI and fMRI outcomes (reported separately). MRS was used to compare neurometabolite concentrations [choline (Cho), n-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and creatine (Cre)] in a white matter region and a hippocampal region between the four study groups. Choline concentration in the frontal/parietal white matter region, lateral to the midsection of the corpus callosum, was significantly lower in FAS/PFAS relative to all other study groups. Choline decreased significantly with decreasing frontal white matter volume and corpus callosum length. These outcomes suggest low choline concentrations may reflect white matter deficits among FAS/PFAS. Choline also decreased significantly with increasing severity of the 4-Digit FAS facial phenotype, increasing impairment in psychological performance and increasing alcohol exposure. NAA and Cre concentrations did not vary significantly. This study provides further evidence of the vulnerability of the cholinergic system in FASD. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can damage the fetal brain and lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Despite public warnings discouraging alcohol use during pregnancy, many pregnant women continue to drink intermittently because they do not believe that occasional exposures to alcohol can be harmful to a fetus. However, because of genetic differences, some fetuses are much more susceptible than others to alcohol-induced brain injury. Thus, a relatively low quantity of alcohol that may be innocuous to most fetuses could damage a genetically susceptible fetus. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) can protect developing mouse neurons against alcohol toxicity by synthesizing neuroprotective nitric oxide. This study examined whether a single exposure to alcohol, which causes no evident injury in wild type mice, can damage the brains of mice genetically deficient for nNOS (nNOS-/- mice). Wild type and nNOS-/- mice received intraperitoneal injections of alcohol (0.0, 2.2, or 4.4 mg/g body weight) either as a single dose on postnatal day (PD) 4 or as repeated daily doses over PD4-9. Brain volumes and neuronal numbers within the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were determined on PD10. Alcohol exposure on PD4-9 restricted brain growth and caused neuronal death in both strains of mice, but the severity of microencephaly and neuronal loss were more severe in the nNOS-/- mice than in wild type. The 4.4 mg/g alcohol dose administered on PD4 alone caused significant neuronal loss and microencephaly in the nNOS-/- mice, while this same dose caused no evident injury in the wild type mice. Thus, during development, a single exposure to alcohol can injure a genetically vulnerable brain, while it leaves a wild type brain unaffected. Since the genes that confer alcohol resistance and vulnerability in developing humans are unknown, any particular human fetus is potentially vulnerable. Thus, women should be counseled to consume no alcohol during pregnancy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can affect brain development, leading to behavioral problems, including overactivity, motor dysfunction and learning deficits. Despite warnings about the effects of drinking during pregnancy, rates of fetal alcohol syndrome remain unchanged and thus, there is an urgent need to identify interventions that reduce the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is neuroprotective against ethanol-related toxicity and promotes white matter production following a number of insults. Given that prenatal alcohol leads to cell death and white matter deficits, the present study examined whether IGF-I could reduce the severity of behavioral deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure. Sprague-Dawley rat pups received ethanol intubations (5.25 g/kg/day) or sham intubations on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester. On PD 10-13, subjects from each treatment received 0 or 10 mug IGF-I intranasally each day. Subjects were then tested on a series of behavioral tasks including open field activity (PD 18-21), parallel bar motor coordination (PD 30-32) and Morris maze spatial learning (PD 45-52). Ethanol exposure produced overactivity, motor coordination impairments, and spatial learning deficits. IGF-I treatment significantly mitigated ethanol's effects on motor coordination, but not on the other two behavioral tasks. These data indicate that IGF-I may be a potential treatment for some of ethanol's damaging effects, a finding that has important implications for children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation.Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that plays an important role in neuronal development and survival as well as in synaptic and morphological plasticity. Our objective was to delineate BDNF expression during embryonic development and evaluate if prenatal alcohol exposure effects BDNF expression in mouse embryos and young-adult mouse brains. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or placebo. Embryos were harvested at 6h(E8), 24h(E9), day 10(E18) and pups at postnatal day 40 (PND40). Each sample included at least 3 embryos or brains, representing at least 3 litters per time point. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time PCR was performed to quantify BDNF with HPRT1 standardization. Statistics included ANOVA and Fisher PLSD. RESULTS: BDNF expression was higher in E8 compared to E9 and E18 in control embryos. At 6h, BDNF expression in the alcohol-exposed embryos was lower than in controls (P<.05); at 24h and E18 BDNF was higher in the alcohol-exposed embryos than the controls (all P<.05). We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults hippocampus and cortex (all P>.05). {Figure presented} CONCLUSION: Prenatal alcohol exposure during development induces a decrease in BDNF expression 6h after the alcohol exposure and an increase after 24h and 10 days, without differences in the young-adult brain. Alterations in BDNF expression during development may underlie some of the of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation; prenatal alcohol exposure affects the development of the nervous system. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that is essential in normal neuronal development and survival as well as synaptic plasticity, an important factor in learning and memory. Previously, we have shown that prenatal treatment with neuroprotective peptides, NAP+SAL, prevented alcohol induced fetal anomalies and learning deficits. Our objective was to evaluate if NAP+SAL's neuroprotective effects are mediated by preventing alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression during embryonic development. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides (20g, 30 min before alcohol). Embryos were harvested at 6h(E8), 24h(E9) and day 10(E18). Each sample included at least 3 embryos, representing at least 3 litters per time point. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time PCR was performed to quantify BDNF with HPRT1 standardization. Statistics included ANOVA and Fisher PLSD. RESULTS: At 6h pretreatment with NAP + SAL did not prevent the alcohol-induced decline in BDNF (P=0.9). However, pretreatment with the peptides NAP+SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P<0.05) at 24h and E18. {Figure presented} CONCLUSION: NAP+SAL prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24h and 10 days after alcohol exposure. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies and learning deficits in fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinical manifestations of FASD are highly variable and include physical, mental and growth retardation, and multiple organ defects. The complex and diverse response of fetal cells to ethanol has prompted us to use a bioinformatics approach to study the effect of ethanol on fetal stem cells derived from the amniotic fluid (AFSCs). Large-scale transcriptome analysis of ethanol-treated AFSC showed pathways involved in skeletal development and ossification were up-regulated, suggesting a basis for ethanol-induced skeletal malformations in vivo. We therefore examined ethanol's effect on osteogenic differentiation of AFSC. Ethanol treatment during the first 48 hours of osteogenic differentiation increased calcium deposition, and increased both gene and protein expression of alkaline phosphatase. In contrast, ethanol treatment at a midpoint of differentiation (day 8) had no significant effect on the protein expression of alkaline phosphatase. These results suggest that transient exposure of AFSC to ethanol during early differentiation has long-term effects and enhances osteogenic diffferentiation as indicated by an increase in bone-specific markers and calcium deposition.

N2  - Children exposed prenatally to alcohol may present with a broad range of problems, referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Neurodevelopmental deficits in these children include both primary problems related to central nervous system alterations, and secondary problems including an increased prevalence of depression and addiction. Alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) function are related to depression and addiction, and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters HPA function. Using our model of PAE, key brain regions were investigated in males and females following exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS) in adulthood. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley females were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: 1) Alcohol (ethanol, E)-liquid diet containing 36% ethanolderived calories; 2) Pair-fed (PF)-isocaloric liquid diet with maltose-dextrin substituted for ethanol, g/kg body wt/day of gestation; and 3) Control (C)-lab chow ad libitum. In adulthood, male and female offspring were either left undisturbed or were subjected to a 10 day CMS regimen. All animals were sacrificed on day 11 under basal conditions, and brains were analyzed for mRNA levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Preliminary evidence suggests that CRH mRNA levels did not differ among prenatal groups within the PVN, but were altered in the basolateral amygdala of E male and female rats. Interestingly, sex differences in CRH mRNA levels in response to stress were observed in E animals. In summary, region- and sexspecific alterations in CRH mRNA following CMS were observed, with differential effects among prenatal treatment groups.

N2  - Nearly half of U.S. pregnancies are "unplanned". Although many women significantly reduce their alcohol use once they know they are pregnant, a large number of women do not realize they are pregnant until they are well into the first trimester. Because the early weeks of pregnancy are considered a critical period of fetal susceptibility to the actions of alcohol, alcohol-related birth defects may become established before a woman is aware she is pregnant. Therefore, to avoid an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP), it is critical to intervene with women prior to conception to help them reduce risky drinking and/or improve contraception. The CDC funded a comprehensive program of research to develop and test a preconception intervention to address risky alcohol use and ineffective contraception in an effort to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Project CHOICES was developed through a series of CDC funded initiatives. Project CHOICES Epidemiology Study (n=2,672): This first study was funded to identify settings with high prevalence of women at risk of AEP (Project CHOICES Research Group, 2002). Six settings were identified including: primary care, university-hospital based OB/GYN practices, an urban jail, substance abuse treatment programs, and a media-recruited sample. Respondents were 6.9 times more likely to be at risk for AEP (12.5%; 95% CI 5.2-9.3) than in the general population (2%). The prevalence of women at risk ranged from 5% in the primary care health centers to 24% in the substance abuse treatment programs. Project CHOICES Feasibility Study (n=190): Having identified settings with high numbers of women at risk, CDC next funded the CHOICES investigators to develop and test the feasibility and impact of an intervention to prevent AEP in a single arm study (Project CHOICES Intervention Research Group, 2003). The CHOICES intervention consisted of four motivational interviewing-based sessions and an OB/GYN visit. At six months postintervention, 68.2% of the women were at reduced risk of AEP. Project CHOICES Randomized Clinical Trial (n=830): Given the success of the feasibility study, the CHOICES investigators were next funded to test the intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT; Floyd, et al., 2007). In the RCT, 69.1% of the women in the CHOICES intervention reduced risk for an AEP at 9-months and the odds of being at reduced risk for AEP were twofold greater (OR 2.11) in the intervention group than the control group (95% CI 1.47-3.03). CHOICES+: The investigators from the Texas site have recently been funded to conduct the next phase of the Project CHOICES comprehensive prevention program. In CHOICES+, the original Project CHOICES intervention will be adapted to a 2-session intervention and modified to include a smoking intervention and referral to an evidence-based smoking cessation program within the Harris County Hospital District, one of the largest public hospital systems in the US. 74% of the women at risk of AEP in the CHOICES Efficacy Trial were current smokers. Smoking is also a potentially modifiable risk factor that frequently co-occurs with alcohol use and increases the risk of maternal and fetal complications. If successful, CHOICES+ could be disseminated throughout hospitals across the country.

N2  - Although fetal alcohol exposure has been associated with deficits in processing speed, relatively little is known about the neurophysiological response patterns that underlie cognitive performance. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in a large sample of Inuit children (M age = 11.3 yr; range = 9.8-12.9 yr) during a visual Go/No-Go task. The task required a button response press to each individually presented letter except the letter "X," which occurred on 30% of the trials. Stimuli were presented on a computer screen for 500 ms, with an offset of 1100 ms and ~200 ms interstimulus interval. Children were classified as either alcohol-exposed (ALC; n = 31) or controls (n = 76), depending on whether the mother reported any binge drinking during pregnancy when interviewed at the time of the ERP assessment. Both groups were more accurate in executing Go responses than in inhibiting No-go, M = 92 vs. 64%, F(1,105) = 522.1, p <.001. Failures to inhibit to No-go occurred more rapidly than correct Go presses, M = 395 vs. 465 ms, F(1,105) = 173.4, p <.001, suggesting that the pace of the task led to some impulsive errors. There were no differences between groups in accuracy or reaction time (ps >.20). ERP analyses focused primarily on Cz over the central scalp region, which revealed a slower P2 latency in ALC vs. controls, M = 269 vs. 252 ms, F(1,105) = 6.2, p <.05. As expected, P3 peak amplitude was larger to No-go vs. Go in all children, M = 14.8 vs. 6.7 muV, F(1,105) = 107.3, p <.001, but the No-go P3 was significantly reduced in the ALC group when compared with controls, M = 12.9 vs. 16.6 muV, F(1,105) = 5.1, p <.05. The finding of a delayed P2 component is consistent with recent findings on a similar visual Go/No-go task in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, suggesting a deficit in stimulus perception and identification processing that is evident at relatively low thresholds of exposure. In the context of the Go/No-go paradigm, the reduced P3 in the alcohol-exposed group may reflect less synchronous neuronal firing or reduced attentional allocation associated with response inhibition. These ERP effects, which were unaltered after accounting for a comprehensive set of potential confounders, indicate high specificity for alcohol. The absence of performance differences on this relatively challenging task suggests that the children with prenatal alcohol exposure may be achieving successful response inhibition through different neural pathways.

N2  - Purpose: Reductions in hippocampal volume are commonly reported in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs); for example, previous work in our lab has shown loss of left hippocampal volume and disturbed age-related volumetric hippocampal growth relative to typically developing controls (Willoughby et al., JINS, 2008). Given the memory impairments in FASDs and hippocampal vulnerability to prenatal alcohol exposure hippocampal abnormalities may be expected, although some authors have reported no volume differences relative to typically developing controls. However, volumetry measures may not reveal the full scope of prenatal alcohol damage and more subtle hippocampal deficits may exist. Thus, the purpose of this research is to extend study of the hippocampus in FASDs beyond volume measures to other indices of hippocampal shape and composition. We hypothesized that the hippocampi in children with a FASD would show (1) reduced linear width, (2) disturbed microstructural diffusion characteristics, and (3) an abnormal metabolic profile. Methods: 24 children with a FASD and 21 controls, aged 10-14 underwent scanning in a 1.5T GE scanner. Structural, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data were collected. For both the left and right hippocampus two raters masked to group status (1) manually traced volume and width, (2) yielded ROI-based measures of mean diffusivity, axial and radial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy, and (3) measured absolute metabolic concentrations. Results: In FASD relative to controls left hippocampal parameters showed an overall thinning and significantly reduced width in the posterior region (p <.05). Mean, axial, and radial diffusivity were reduced in the medial temporal lobe and multiple metabolic differences were observed, with decreases in inositol, Nacetyl-aspartate, and glutamine-glutamate (all ps <.05). There were fewer differences between typically developing children and children with a FASD on right hippocampal parameters, although middle hippocampal width and creatine were reduced suggesting damage occurred (ps<.05). Conclusions: These findings reveal an array of hippocampal abnormalities in children with a FASD. The left hippocampus in particular showed posterior thinning, decreased diffusivity, and aberrant metabolic profiles.

N2  - Gestational alcohol exposure is associated with structural and functional brain alterations, neuropsychological deficits, and increased risk of developing mental illness, including substance use disorders. Cognitive vulnerabilities have been proposed as one potential mechanism contributing to addiction risk, but little research has compared the cognitive abilities of youth with FASD to other populations at risk for problematic substance use. This study compared neuropsychological performance of youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to peers with conduct disorder and/or a familial history of alcoholism, but without prenatal alcohol exposure. Sixty-nine youth (mean age: 13.6 years) underwent neuropsychological assessment, across four demographically-matched groupings: youth with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (n = 17), youth with a high density of non-maternal familial alcoholism (n = 16), youth with conduct disorder (n = 18), and comparison youth without risk factors (n = 18). Neuropsychological outcomes included measures of working memory, planning, processing speed, and academic achievement. Caregivers also completed a behavior checklist. Between-group comparisons revealed that the FASD group showed poorer performance on the majority of neuropsychological outcomes examined and higher rates of behavior problems, compared to the three other groups, which did not differ from each other. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) of observed differences ranged from medium to large. These data show poorer neuropsychological performance and higher rates of caregiver reported behavior problems in adolescents with FASD, in comparison to youth with risk factors for developing substance use problems. Future studies will examine how cognitive impairments may relate to the development of problematic substance use in individuals with FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) disorders. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, and are unique in their capacity for continuous self-renewal and pluripotential differentiation. When cultured in suspension, without antidifferentiation factors, mouse ES cells differentiate to three-dimensional multicellular aggregates, called embryoid bodies (EBs). A set of transcription factors (Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog) is responsible for maintaining the ES cell state in both humans and mice through activation/repression of target genes. Downregulation of these transcription factors has been shown to occur during cell differentiation. We used the spontaneous, untargeted differentiation of mouse ES cells to EBs as an in vitro model to investigate the effect of ethanol during early embryogenesis. Our previous study using Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates has indicated that ethanol exposure of mouse ES cells during differentiation to EBs interfered with the expression levels of Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog. Here, we used multicolor flow cytometry (FC) for pluripotency marker analysis, simultaneously with measurement of cell viability and apoptosis markers (7-AAD staining and anti-cleaved PARP antibody) to distinguish protein expression levels in live vs. apoptotic/dead cells. Data showed that during differentiation of mES cells to EBs in live cells i) both Sox2 and Nanog protein expression were downregulated, and ii) treatment of ES cells with ethanol for three days accelerated downregulation of Sox2 and Nanog expression. Furthermore, iii) ethanol induced more than two-fold increase in apoptosis during differentiation of ES cells to EBs, as assessed by FC with annexin-V/7-AAD staining. Our findings suggest that ethanol triggers apoptosis and deregulates the pluripotency regulatory network of core transcription factors during early embryogenesis, which may be responsible for abnormalities observed in FAS. This study lays the foundation for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating the differentiated EB state in response to ethanol.

N2  - Cardinal features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) include varying degrees of central nervous system dysfunction and growth retardation. We previously reported that with each bout of maternal alcohol consumption (1.75 g/kg), the mother and fetus exhibit transient acidemia and reductions in maternal and fetal plasma amino acid levels, the availability of which are critical to fetal growth and development. This study tested the hypothesis that supplementation with glutamine, an amino acid that is important in the regulation of acid base homeostasis, would lessen or eliminate the reduction in fetal plasma amino acid levels in response to alcohol (thus potentially having a protective effect). Pregnant ewes at 130 +/- 7 days gestation were assigned to one of three treatment groups: a saline control group, an alcohol group, and an alcohol plus glutamine supplementation group. The alcohol (1.75 mg/kg) or saline infusions were delivered intravenously over an hour. L-Glutamine (30 mg/kg) was administered as a bolus intravenously at the beginning of the experiment. Changes in fetal arterial pH and amino acid levels (measured by HPLC) were measured over one hour (peak BAC occurs at one hour). The alcohol group displayed a significant reduction in plasma levels of multiple amino acids, including glutamine, arginine, citrulline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, histidine, alanine, phenylalanine, ornithine, glycine, and b-alanine at the 60th minute compared to the baseline values. In contrast, the saline control group exhibited no differences and there were mild elevations or no changes in the alcohol plus glutamine group. Thus, we conclude that the fetal growth retardation caused by alcohol induced alterations in fetal amino acids levels may be ameliorated by glutamine supplementation. Supported by NIAAA 10940 (TAC).

N2  - Previous work demonstrated that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) results in brain defects at different stages of development. The current studies were undertaken to characterize the effects of PAE on the levels of several neurotransmitters at early developmental stages. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed at embryonic day 7 (E7) with either a 25% ethanol derived calorie (ALC) or pair-fed (PF) liquid diet. At E13, fetal brains were collected from dams of both the ALC and PF groups. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to evaluate the levels of neurotransmitters in E13 fetal brains. This approach employed here involves the use of a chiral LC column in conjunction with quantitative mass spectrometric multiple reaction monitoring attained utilizing a triple quadrupole MS. Quantitative chiral analyses of catecholamines, idolamine and amino acids neurotransmitters revealed the reduction in the levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin and glutamate as a result of PAE (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the levels of glutamate in fetal brains at E13 between the ALC and PF groups. These findings demonstrate that PAE reduces the levels of catecholamines, idolamine and amino acids neurotransmitters in E13 fetal brains. This study suggests that alterations of selective neurotransmitters may be the cause of abnormalities in brain functions and behaviors in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

N2  - A cardinal feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is growth deficiency and all models of intrauterine growth restriction demonstrate reductions in uterine blood flow. Pregnancy-induced increases in uterine blood flow (~30 fold) is associated with increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, eNOS phosphorylation, and nitric oxide production at the level of maternal uterine artery endothelial cells (UAECs). We hypothesized that ethanol will reduce eNOS expression and its activity via reduced phosphorylation and the signaling pathways that control eNOS activity in UAECs. Endothelial cells from primary uterine arteries of pregnant ewes (gestational day 120-130; term = 147) were isolated and validated using FACS and maintained in culture to passage 4. Maternal binge drinking patterns were mimicked; i.e. UAECs cultured to 70% confluence were treated with 0 (control), 60, 90, 120, or 150 mg/dl of ethanol in a compensating system for 5 h on 2 consecutive days. Cell lysates were analyzed using Western blotting. Cell viability was maintained among groups; uncleaved caspase 3 was unaltered by ethanol and cleaved caspase 3 was not detectable. Compared to control, total eNOS level was reduced to 70%, 70%, 63%, and 43% at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl ethanol respectively. p635eNOS also decreased substantially to 29%, 21%, 18%, and 15% with increasing ethanol concentrations. Caveolin-1, the caveolar scaffolding protein that is predominantly associated with eNOS was unaltered by ethanol treatment. However, investigation of the ERK1/2 pathway, the major signaling cascade that is coupled to eNOS activation in UAECs revealed that total ERK1 was reduced to 87%, 75%, 55%, and 16% and total ERK2 was reduced to 66%, 55%, 35%, and 21% respectively at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl ethanol. In addition, compared to the control, pERK1 level was reduced to 57%, 32%, 29%, and 24% with increasing ethanol doses. These alterations were specific to ERK1/2 signaling in that pAKT or total AKT were not altered among groups. These data delineate the effects of binge-like ethanol exposure on the abundance and post-translational modification via phosphorylation of eNOS and ERK1/2 enzymes in UAECs. Further, stoichiometrically disproportional levels of eNOS and caveolin-1 may influence eNOS phosphorylation. These results strongly hint that intrauterine environment may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of FASD. Support: NIH HL49210, HD38843 HL89144, AA10940.

N2  - There is increasing evidence that alcohol exposure during the developmental period can leave lasting epigenetic marks consequently perturbing the expression of key genes resulting in physiological and behavioral changes in the offspring of the exposed individual. For example, the expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene in the hypothalamic nuclei of rats exposed to alcohol in utero is significantly diminished as compared to control animals. Long lasting changes in the gene expression of various genes are often caused by alteration in the DNA methylation pattern in the promoter region of the affected gene. In this study we investigated the effect of the prenatal alcohol exposure on the DNA methylation in the hypothalamic POMC promoter by methylation-specific PCR. The rat POMC gene contains a CpG island spanning almost 200 bps in the -59 to -244 region. Nine sets of primers specific for various CpG-rich sites from this region were designed to assess the extent of cytosine methylation in the male offspring of alcohol-fed (AF) mother compared to the pair-fed (PF) and ad libitum-fed (AD) groups. We identified several sites where the cytosine methylation in the AF animals was significantly higher than in the control groups. In particular, in the site spanning the region -81 to -146 the ratio of methylated to unmethylated signals was 6 to 10 times higher in AF animals in comparison to controls. Thus, the POMC promoter hypermethylation in the hypothalami of the AF rats may be a causative factor in the decrease of neuronal POMC gene expression in the affected animals.

N2  - Background: We previously identified a metric of "at-risk" drinking during pregnancy in an urban African-American cohort. The metric included multiple indicators of alcohol consumption and of problem drinking. The metric was validated by demonstrating that it had greater utility than individual measures of alcohol consumption in predicting several neurobehavioral outcomes in preschool children. We hypothesized that our metric of "at-risk" drinking would also improve prediction of birth outcomes. Methods: A measure of "at-risk" prenatal alcohol exposure was constructed using antenatal maternal report of average alcohol per day (AAD) and per drinking day (AADD) at around conception, at the first prenatal visit, and across pregnancy. Scores on the MAST, T-ACE and CAGE screens were also included in computing the "at-risk" metric. Birth size data were used for 224 children from the same cohort and who did not participate in the previous preschool assessment. Ballard maturational score and measures of birth weight, birth length, and head circumference were examined. Data were analyzed using partial correlations between birth data and the "at-risk" metric and the several component measures of prenatal alcohol consumption, controlling for gestational age based on date of last menstrual period. Results: Smaller birth size, including birth-weight and a trend for birth-height, and lower Ballard maturational scores at birth were predicted solely by the metric of "at-risk" alcohol consumption. Conclusion: The current metric of maternal gestational alcohol consumption predicted alcohol-related decreases in birth weight and birth length and gestation age at birth. The results further validated the metric as a more reliable assessment of fetal risk prenatal alcohol exposure than any of the component frequency/quantity measures. Previous research has demonstrated a significant potential for considerable maternal under-reporting and denial of in-pregnancy alcohol consumption. The current or similar metrics may limit under-reporting and be more accurate assessments of exposure, critical to diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) and to research examining neurobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine important predictors of periconceptional risky drinking among pregnant Latinas in New Mexico. Binge drinking patterns during pregnancy, especially in early pregnancy, might lead to development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in the offspring. Pregnant women attending the University of New Mexico prenatal care clinics served as the study population. Consecutively chosen patients who gave consent were recruited into the study. For purposes of this analysis, the sample size was restricted to 155 Latina women. Women were interviewed by a bilingual trained interviewer about any episodes of binge drinking (> 4 drinks/occasion) a month around their last menstrual period (LMP) and were administered a TWEAK screening questionnaire. Socio-demographic (age, education, insurance, place of birth, marital status), lifestyle (smoking), and reproductive health (gravidity, parity, pregnancy planning, history of adverse perinatal outcomes) characteristics were ascertained. The expected date of delivery and gestational age were based on LMP and fetal ultrasound. Predictors of binge drinking were identified by Chi-square tests and logistic regression in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. A backward selection procedure was used to identify those covariates that were independently associated with binge drinking in the final multivariable model. In this sample, 17.4% of Latinas admitted at least one binge drinking episode a month around their LMP. Results of multivariate analysis indicate that Latinas born in the U.S. have much greater risk of binge drinking in periconceptional period (OR=3.2; 95% CI: 1.2; 8.9) compared to foreign-born Latinas. Similarly, Latinas who primarily speak English at home were at much greater risk (OR=3.6; 95% CI: 1.3; 10.5) compared with predominately Spanish-speaking women. No other variables were identified as significant predictors in multivariable models. Even though Latinas are often considered to be at lower risk of alcohol abuse, recent reports indicate that the pre valence of alcohol consumption in this group might be increasing due to changing cultural norms. Our results indicate that higher-acculturated Latinas are at much greater risk of binge drinking before conception and in early pregnancy compared with less-acculturated Latinas. Culturally sensitive interventions should be developed to address risky alcohol consumption among Latinas of reproductive age.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts behavioral development, leading to long-lasting alterations in a number of domains, including cognitive performance. Using a rodent model, we have previously shown that choline supplementation can attenuate adverse effects of developmental alcohol exposure, even when administered weeks later, during postnatal development. The present study examined whether administration of choline at different postnatal ages following ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent neonatal brain growth spurt, can reduce alcohol-related memory impairments. Neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of seven treatment groups. Five groups received ethanol intubations in a binge-like manner from postnatal day (PD) 4-9 at a dose of 5.25 g/kg/day; two groups served as sham intubated controls. All rats were injected s.c. from PD 11-40 with either 100 mg/kg/day choline chloride or saline. One ethanol-exposed group was injected with saline from PD 11-40; the others received choline injections from PD 11-20, PD 21-30, PD 31-40, or PD 11-40. The two sham groups received either choline or saline throughout the PD 11-40 period. At three months of age, subjects were tested on an object recognition task, a simple and sensitive task used to assess long-term memory. On day 1 of the task, all rats spent a substantially higher amount of time exploring an unfamiliar square wood bead than familiar circular wood beads. On day 2, a significant preference for a second novel object, a wooden spindle over the square was observed in all groups, except the ethanol-exposed group not treated with choline. That is, administration of choline supplementation at any of the time points significantly improved object recognition performance among alcohol-exposed, with the greatest improvement among those that received choline from PD 11-40. These findings suggest that choline administration at various postnatal periods can attenuate ethanol's effects on simple memory performance. These results have important implications for the intervention of alcohol's adverse effects on development, indicating that choline may serve as an effective treatment for individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, even when administered later in postnatal life.

N2  - Prevention of alcohol use is difficult, thus therapies that ameliorate alcohol's damage are desirable. The severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) increases with parity, implying the depletion of a protective maternal factor. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in women and causes neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring that parallel FASD. We hypothesized that moderate maternal iron inadequacy (ID) exacerbates alcohol's effects upon the developing brain and tested this in rat pups reared by dams fed iron-sufficient (IS) or ID diets. We exposed pups to 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg alcohol during the brain growth spurt period via gastric gavage (postnatal days 4-9; P4-9). Blood alcohol levels were not altered by iron status and peaks were ~275 or ~420 mg/dl for the 3.5 and 5 g/kg alcohol doses, respectively. Dams of the ID pups had depleted iron stores without anemia, a condition common in American women. At P10, ID pups fed 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg alcohol (ID-0, ID-3.5, ID-5) were smaller and anemic as indicated by decreased hemoglobin. At ~P32 we evaluated the pups' associative learning skills using delay eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC), a cerebellum-dependent task. The frequency and amplitude of conditioned responses (CR) in the ID-0, IS-0, IS-3.5, and IS-5 groups did not differ reflecting the test's simplicity. In contrast, ID-5 pups had a dramatically reduced CR frequency and strength; values were ~63% and 38%, respectively, of control values. ID-3.5 pups had a non-significant trend toward impaired learning. A main effect for alcohol dose and significant iron status x alcohol dose interaction were seen for CR frequency, F[2, 47]=6.44, p < 0.005, and CR amplitude, F[2, 47]=3.23, p < 0.05. Proliferative and apoptotic responses in the P10 cerebellar cortex were evaluated with cleaved caspase-3 and phosphohistone H3 immunostaining. Preliminary results indicate that ID-5 pups have increased cerebellar proliferation and apoptosis when compared to IS-5 pups. Additional behavioral assessments, including trace ECC, are underway to evaluate the extent of the neurodevelopmental damage caused by alcohol and developmental ID. This is the first study to show that maternal iron inadequacy profoundly exacerbates alcohol's effects upon learning in the offspring. We propose that maternal iron status is an important modulator of fetal neurobehavioral outcome following alcohol exposure. (Funded by NIH award T32 ES07015, R32 AA11085 and Palmer fund).

N2  - Introduction: Identifying neurochemical effects specific to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can help define neurobehavioral profiles in the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs). In vivo phosphorus (31P) MR spectroscopy profiles neurochemical development after PAE by measuring components of metabolic pathways of membrane phospholipids (MPLs), including precursors (e.g., phosphoethanolamine [PE] and phosphocholine [PC]) and breakdown products (e.g., glycerophosphoethanolamine [GPE] and and glycerophosphocholine [GPC]). MPL precursor levels are sensitive to early neurodevelopmental changes in cortex. We hypothesized that PAE would alter MPL metabolism, reflecting frontocortical developmental delay. Methods: Participants were 20 African American children - 11 PAE (6 boys, 6.0-7.6 yrs old) and 9 non-PAE (3 boys, 6.0-8.0 yrs old) - from a larger study of interactionsof gestational nutrition and prenatal alcohol. A 3-D whole-brain, multi-voxel 31P spectroscopy measure was done at 4 Tesla. Cortical regions of interest included dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC), orbitofrontal (OFC), ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC), anterior cingulate (ACC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Group differences in levels of PE, PC, GPE, and GPC were tested using the generalized estimating equation method with group, gender, and side (right vs. left) as factors. Results: PE levels were significantly higher bilaterally in the ACC, IFG and vmPFC of PAE children compared to non-PAE children. GPE levels were significantly higher in DLPFC and GPC levels were higher in the OFC in PAE children compared to non-PAE children. Conclusion: In healthy development, PE levels are higher at birth then decrease with age, reflecting high early MPL synthesis critical for neocortical development. In contrast, levels of MPL breakdown products (GPE and GPC) are low early in life and later increase, reflecting greater MPL turnover in older children. The current preliminary results showing higher PE levels and greater breakdown activity of MPLs in several prefrontal areas suggest a possible PAE-related delay in the maturation of cortical development. The implications of possible deviations in developmental trajectories of MPL metabolism and relations to neurobehavioral outcome remain to be determined.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have altered performance in learning and memory tasks and have altered physiological function, including hyperesponsiveness to stressors. In our rat model, parallel changes are observed. The hippocampus is a key modulator of stress, is involved in learning and memory, and is a site for adult neurogenesis. Previously, we found that PAE alters stressinduced suppression in neurogenesis in male rats. Here we investigated patterns of adult hippocampal neurogenesis under basal and stress conditions in PAE female rats. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley females were assigned to 1 of 3 prenatal treatments on day 1 of pregnancy: 1) Alcohol (ethanol, E) - liquid diet containing 36% ethanol-derived calories; 2) Pair-fed (PF) - isocaloric liquid diet with maltosedextrin substituted for ethanol, g/kg body wt/day of gestation; and 3) Control (C) - lab chow ad libitum. In adulthood, female offspring were assigned to either non-stress (undisturbed throughout) or stress (9 days of repeated restraint stress, 1 hr/day) conditions. On day 10, all rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine and perfused either 24hr (cell proliferation) or 3wk (cell survival) later. There was a stressinduced increase in cell proliferation in C (p=.058), but not E or PF females. While there was no effect of stress on cell survival in C and E females, PF females exhibited a stress-induced decrease, which may be due to elevated levels of cell survival under basal conditions (PF>C,E, p <.05). Cell survival was further assessed using NeuN (neuron specific marker) and GFAP (glial cell marker). E females produced fewer new neurons than C and PF females under both basal and stress conditions (p < 05). Intriguingly, E females also had reduced glial cells compared to C and PF animals under both basal and stress conditions (p <.05). These results indicate that alterations in adult neurogenesis occur under both basal and stress conditions in E females. PAE appears to alter the neurogenic stress response differentially in males and females, suggesting a mediating role for the gonadal hormones. It is possible that alterations in neurogenesis following PAE and stress may contribute to learning and memory deficits seen in individuals with FASD. Specific PF effects could be due to the stress/diet restriction that accompanies pair-feeding.

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to establish the clinical value of meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) analysis as a universal screening tool intended for the identification of infants at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). This will be accomplished by assessing the level of voluntary participation in a prenatal alcohol exposure screening program with informed consent, and by determining the logistics and feasibility of implementing meconium testing, the necessary follow-up, and intervention programs, as part of routine care. In addition, this study will determine whether FAEE-positive meconium correlate with standard childhood developmental milestones and Bayley's test for neurodevelopmental screening. Methods: Over the course of 5 years, informed consent will be sought from all women from the region of Grey Bruce, Ontario delivering at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario. Meconium samples will be collected and tested for the presence of FAEE by solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Children who test positive for meconium FAEE will be matched to children who test negative and followed-up for 2 years through an existing Public Health program in the area involving frequent home visits and assessments of developmental milestones by a Public Health nurse. Matched controls will be followed-up by study personnel via regular phone interviews to assess developmental milestones. If a developmental delay is suspected, the child will undergo neurodevelopmental testing with a trained professional, and will be referred to various intervention programs in the area tailored to the child's needs. Furthermore, support services for the mother will be available if needed. This study has been approved by research ethics boards of the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Western Ontario. Results: Enrollment and sample collection has begun in November, 2008. The first positive case has been identified, and the planned follow-up set up with the Public Health department. Discussion: This study will reveal the population's willingness to partake in a neonatal screening program for prenatal ethanol exposure, assess its utility as a standard tool in clinical practice, and enable us to propose a model for service delivery. Furthermore, this study will determine the predictive value of FAEE-positive meconium with regards to neurodevelopment delays frequently observed in FASD-affected individuals.

N2  - Most children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy can not be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We are investigating whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene and protein expression at term may provide a reliable and sensitive diagnostic indicator of maternal drinking during pregnancy as well as a prognostic indicator of the risk of functional brain damage predictive of adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in affected offspring. We previously reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy alters the expression of about two dozen genes coding for proteins associated with nervous, endocrine and immune system development. In the current study, we initiated a combination of two-dimensional PAGE analyses coupled with mass spectroscopy to identify placental proteins altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were assigned to one of two experimental groups. One group consumed a 5% ethanol solution (in 0.066% saccharin water) four hours a day throughout gestation, resulting in a mean maternal peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. A control group consumed a matched volume of saccharin water four hours each day. At term (gestational day 20) placentas were harvested, saline-perfused to remove blood from the tissue, and processed for analysis of protein expression. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis revealed a large number of proteins whose expression is diminished by maternal drinking during pregnancy. To date, preliminary mass spectroscopic analysis of isolated spots has identified eighteen proteins altered by maternal drinking. These proteins are associated with processes in cell differentiation and development, morphogenesis of anatomical structures and regulation of apoptosis. The preliminary results suggest that a sufficiently large enough number of placental proteins are altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD.

N2  - Introduction: Craniofacial dysmorphology is an important but poorly understood diagnostic feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). To further understand the developmental consequences of alcohol exposure, this study was designed with two objectives: (1) Identify the effect of alcohol exposure on underlying cranial facial bone growth in a mouse model; and (2) Examine the relationship between bone and facial dysmorphology and compare mouse and human morphometries. Methods: Four treatments of C57BL/6J dams (The Jackson Laboratory), CHOW, ALC-PF (pre-pregnancy alcohol exposure and at-pregnancy isocaloric pair-fed), PF-PF (pre- and at-pregnancy pair-fed), and ALC-ALC (pre- and at-pregnancy alcohol exposure) were studied. The pre-pregnancy treatment lasted 7 days prior to mating and the pregnancy treatment between gestational day 7 (E7) and E16, using a 4.8% (v/v) alcohol exposure in a liquid diet. In-vivo three dimensional microCT imagings were performed at p7. Fifteen metric distances were measured on the skulls, which matched to the human studies by Moore et al. (2007). Stepwise discriminant analysis was performed examining the ability of anthropomorphic measures to classify alcohol exposed mice. Results: Measurements of width (minimal frontal and bigonial) correctly classified 90% of the ALC-ALC mice Vs 91 % of the CHOW mice. Results comparing ALC-ALC to ALC-PF used inner canthai and mid face differences and correctly classified 76% and 83% respectively. These results are similar to those based on microvedio facial analysis in mouse (see Anthony et al adjacent poster). Conclusion: These results are similar to those reported in human studies (Moore et al., 2007) in which width and depth measurements successfully classified FAS individuals from controls. This indicates a similar effect of alcohol exposure on dysmorphology across species. Further studies will help delineate effects of quantity and frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure on facial dysmorphology to enable diagnosis of FASD.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), including a wide spectrum of developmental deficits in face and brain. Presence of a set of abnormal facial features (including a smooth Philtrum, short Palpebral fissures, and thin Upper Vermillion) is required for diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, many children with prenatal alcohol exposure sufficient to induce facial deficits do not show cardinal features of facial dysmorphology and diagnosis is not feasible. This study aims to delineate the effect of alcohol on the spectrum of dysmorphic facial features, using mice, C57BL/B6J (B6J, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Ma), and C57BL/6N (B6N, Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN), with common ancestry, separated by > 150 generations. The alcohol treatment consists of 4.8% alcohol liquid diet for 7 days pre-pregnancy, and gestational days 7(E7)to E16. The diet volume, blood alcohol levels, and 14 anthropometric facial measurements for E17 embryos were analyzed. Measurements were used in discriminant analysis to obtain positive predictability of alcohol exposure. We found that B6N demonstrated higher alcohol intake and blood alcohol concentrations than B6J, and embryonic weights are reduced in both lines. Alcohol altered upper and mid facial depths; nasal, nasal bridge and palpebral fissure lengths; and outer canthal width in both B6N and B6J, with B6N having additional facial width changes. Discriminant analysis of facial measurements to classify alcohol exposure for Alc to Chow control demonstrated B6N and B6J required minimal frontal width, with B6N requiring added width features, apposed to B6J requiring width and depth features. (Predictability: B6N, 90%; B6J, 87%). Analysis of Alc to Pair-Fed groups suggested B6N required width classifications with mid facial depth, and B6J required facial depth and height (predictability: B6N, 92%; B6J, 85%). Our data indicates that B6N and B6J mice show dysmorphic facial features, comparable to human facial differences by ethnicity (Moore et al., 2007). Current data shows differences in the severity of facial dysmorphology in mice with common ancestry, possibly attributed to genetic drift.

N2  - Purpose: Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine trends in current alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant and nonpregnant women of childbearing age between 2001 and 2005 and to examine the prevalence among sociodemographic subgroups based on age, race/ethnicity, education, employment status and marital status. Methods: Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collected from 2001 through 2005 among 14,139 pregnant and 324,668 nonpregnant women aged 18-44 were analyzed. Annual prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking (5 or more drinks on an occasion) in the past 30 days were calculated for pregnant and nonpregnant women. Statistical significance of the relationship between prevalence estimates and time was estimated using chi-square tests. Prevalence estimates among subgroups were also estimated and logistic regression was used to determine the association between alcohol use and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: The findings indicate that while no statistically significant change occurred between 2001 and 2005 among pregnant women, a slight decline occurred in the prevalence of any alcohol use (54.6% to 52.2%; p<.001) and binge drinking (12.3% to 11.5%; p<.001) among nonpregnant women of childbearing age. Among pregnant women, the estimated prevalence of any alcohol use was higher among women aged 35-44 years (17.7%) than women aged 18-24 years (8.6%), college educated women (14.4%) than women with a high school education or less (8.5%), employed women (13.6%) than unemployed women (8.2%), and unmarried women (13.3%) than married women (10.2%). Conclusion: The relatively stable prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking demonstrate that alcohol use among women of childbearing age continues to be a public health concern. The higher prevalence of alcohol use among some sociodemographic subgroups such as higher educated, employed, or unmarried women suggests the need for targeted public health prevention activities.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol results in a range of adverse cognitive-behavioral and morphological outcomes, collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Children with FASD consistently exhibit delayed motor development and deficits in sensory-motor skills, suggesting that the measurement of these skills could be a powerful tool for assessing brain dysfunction in this population. There is a significant overlap between the brain structures affected by the teratogenic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and those that are responsible for the performance of sensory-motor tasks. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the robot exoskeleton known as the Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movements (KINARM) could serve as an objective tool for assessing sensory-motor deficits in children with FASD. Male and female children (9 to 15 years of age) were required to complete two tasks that assess sensory-motor control. Task 1: Visually-guided reaching movements examined the ability of subjects to generate goal-directed motor movements with each limb. The data acquisition system extracted over 20 features of visual-guided reaching including reaction time, movement time, joint motion, torque and power, relative joint power, path length, and movement variability. Task 2: Limb matching task required that the subject perform a bilateral limb matching task without vision: the robot moved one limb to a spatial location and the subject was asked to match this limb geometry with the other limb in the absence of visual cues. The resultant errors (the error in matching the spatial position of one arm with the other arm) were measured. In comparison to controls, children with FASD showed slower reaction times with both hands. Movement time was significantly slower in children with FASD only with the right hand. Moreover, children with FASD exhibited greater distance and direction errors with the right, but not the left, hand. Similarly, children with FASD displayed greater error in matching the spatial position of the right, but not the left, hand. The results of this study suggest that the KINARM is a promising research and diagnostic tool that could be used to assess motor control deficits in children resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - We have completed the first year of a 3-year study evaluating the effects of a strength-based, motor skill development program for children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Our hypothesis is that improvements in the motor domain will extend to other domains, and specifically affect behaviour and adaptive functioning. Moreover, prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, and this may underlie some of the behavioural and adaptive problems in individuals with FASD. Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibit increased basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond infancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the motor skill program on the HPA system (as indicated by salivary cortisol levels) and to compare cortisol levels of children with FASD to that of control children. Ten children (age 7-13 y) participated in an 8-week after-school motor skill development program consisting of 2 x 1.5 hour sessions/week. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 5 of these children (with confirmed diagnosis, FASD group) and compared at 3 time points: before, immediately after, and 2 months after completion of the program. In addition, cortisol levels were compared at each time point to 15 control children (C group, no FASD, similar age and gender to FASD group) to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: wake-up, after school, and just before bedtime. Salivary cortisol levels showed significant (p's < 0.05) diurnal variation in all children. Cortisol levels were elevated at wake-up, compared with after school and bedtime (p's < 0.001), but were not different between after school and bedtime. Cortisol levels did not vary significantly over the time points (before, immediately and 2 months after the program) in the C or FASD groups, indicating that there was no effect of the motor skill program on cortisol levels. When the time points were combined, there was a trend (p=0.059) for cortisol levels to be higher at wake-up in children with FASD, compared with control children. These preliminary results indicate that cortisol levels may be elevated at wake-up in children with FASD, and suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure has long-term effects on HPA dysregulation in humans.

N2  - Purpose: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are among the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Identification of nutritional factors that may confer risk or provide protection is critical as these factors are potentially modifiable. Although nutritional status for various micronutrients is known to be affected by chronic alcohol consumption in non-pregnant adults, nutritional status in pregnant women who drink moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol has not been well characterized. We hypothesize that nutritional inadequacies increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with alcohol consumption. Methods: As part of an international collaborative study on FASD, we screened pregnant women in Ukraine and prospectively recruited those who reported moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in early pregnancy and those who reported no or low amounts of alcohol as a comparison group. A blood sample was collected at the time of enrollment (17-18 wks gestation on average) and analyzed for vitamin, mineral and oxidative stress status. Results: We have completed analysis of blood samples for 35 alcohol-exposed women, and 31 comparison pregnant women. Significantly or marginally significantly lower plasma zinc (Zn; p=0.051) and plasma copper (Cu; p=0.019) levels were noted in the alcohol-exposed group relative to unexposed women. We also noted significantly lower ceruloplasmin (Cp) activity (p= 0.036) and TRAP (Total Antioxidant Capacity of Plasma; p=0.006) in the alcohol-exposed group vs. unexposed. Plasma Zn was negatively correlated with TBARs, a lipid peroxidation index, and Cp was positively correlated with TRAP. Conclusion: The compromised Zn and Cu status observed in alcohol-exposed women is consistent with predictions that susceptibility to alcohol-related fetal effects may be influenced by maternal micronutrient deficiencies. Alcohol toxicity is thought to be due in part to oxidative damage; our initial data also show increased oxidative stress with alcohol exposure. Thus, mid-gestation levels of key measures of oxidative stress or antioxidant reserves could be important risk modifiers for alcohol-related adverse pregnancy outcomes. As sample size requirements are met, this continuing study will evaluate the influence of baseline status on these and other nutritional measures on risk for characteristic physical features of FASD, growth, and neurodevelopment in the offspring.

N2  - Purpose: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is among the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Identification of the risks associated with specific dose and gestational timing of alcohol exposure for the characteristic physical features of FASD is needed to aid in diagnosis, particularly in the newborn period, and to provide accurate counseling to pregnant women. Methods: In 2005-6, we screened pregnant women in two regions in Ukraine and prospectively recruited 84 women who reported moderate to heavy alcohol consumption and 82 women who reported little to no alcohol drinking. Women were interviewed at enrollment regarding alcohol exposure in the month around conception and in the previous two-week period using a time-line follow-back method. Following delivery, specially trained geneticists in Ukraine performed blinded physical examinations of infants using a standard checklist of physical features of FASD. Infants who had the cardinal features of FAS including growth deficiency and facial features were classified as "FAS", infants who had some features but final diagnosis required assessment of neurobehavioral performance were classified as "Deferred", and infants with no features were classified as "No FAS". Level of alcohol consumption was compared across the three groups using ANOVA and ANCOVA in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Results: A total of 141 infants were examined by study geneticists. Five infants (3.5%) met criteria for "FAS", 45 infants (31.9%) were "Deferred", and 91 infants (64.5%) were classified as "No FAS". Average daily consumption of absolute ounces of alcohol in both the periconceptional (p=0.002) and the previous two weeks (p < 0.001) was correlated with physical features of FASD after adjustment for maternal tobacco and vitamin use. Average consumption of absolute ounces of alcohol per drinking day in both time periods was also significantly associated with features of FAS (p=0.015 and p < 0.001, respectively). Infants who were classified as "FAS", "Deferred", and "No FAS" were exposed to adjusted means of ~3 drinks, ~2 drinks, and ~1.5 drinks per drinking day in the periconceptional period; slightly lower levels were reported in the most recent two weeks. Conclusion: There is a strong dose-response relation between number of physical features of FASD and quantity of alcohol consumed in early pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: The spectrum of facial and neurobehavioral abnormalities observed among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure makes identification of these individuals difficult. The objective of this study was to explore if a combination of information from anthropometric measures obtained directly and from 3D images and neurobehavioral variables could be used to accurately identify exposed subjects. Methods: As part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), 3D facial images and data from a broad neurobehavioral protocol were collected from 52 children and adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure and 39 non-exposed controls from Helsinki, Finland (35 exposed, 30 non-exposed) and San Diego, CA (17 exposed, 9 non-exposed). Of the exposed subjects, 37 were diagnosed with FAS using the dysmorphological examination procedures of the CIFASD dysmorphology core. For each subject 16 indirect facial measurements, head circumference (direct measurement), and a subset of 29 neurobehavioral variables which had previously been identified as having high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating children with FASD from controls were analyzed. Stepwise discriminant analysis was performed and the percent correct classifications are reported. Performance of the discriminant function was assessed by cross-validation. Results: The most parsimonious model included 4 craniofacial measurements (outer canthal length, nasal length, nasal bridge length, head circumference) and 4 neurobehavioral elements (Delis Kaplan Executive Functioning System: verbal fluency switching, trail making visual scanning; Progressive Planning test: average total time; CANTAB: spatial span total responses). These 8 variables correctly classified 92% of the prenatally exposed and 92% of the non-exposed. There was not a significant difference in classification rates between the samples by site. Thirteen of the 15 subjects, who were prenatally alcohol exposed, but not diagnosed as FAS, were correctly classified as alcohol-exposed. Conclusion: These preliminary results demonstrate that the combination of facial measurements and neurobehavioral test results can reliably identify both previously diagnosed FAS indvidiuals as well as undiagnosed prenatally alcohol exposed individuals. Further studies will focus on other ethnic groups and a broader series of neurobehavioral measures.

N2  - Adaptive function may be especially sensitive to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Previous reports have demonstrated that in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), social skills are negatively associated with age, suggesting deficits in meeting the increasing demands in social functioning. However, this relationship between adaptive function and age in alcohol-exposed children has not been reported in other adaptive domains. We investigated the relation between adaptive function and age in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) and typically developing controls (CON). Additionally, because a current aim of research in FASDs is to identify a distinctive neurobehavioral profile, a clinical contrast group of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was included to determine if observed patterns of adaptive deficits are specific to alcohol exposure. Sixty-five children (ALC=22, ADHD=23, CON=20) were selected from a larger ongoing study of the behavioral teratogenicity of alcohol. ALC and CON subjects were selected to match the ADHD subjects on age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity. Caregivers were administered the VABS, a semi-structured interview, and were asked to rate their child's behavior on three domains of adaptive function (daily living skills, socialization, communication). Data were analyzed using regression techniques. On all three domains, children in both the ALC and ADHD groups showed deficits in adaptive behavior relative to controls. In addition, children in the ALC group were significantly more impaired than the ADHD group on the daily living skills domain. Within the ALC group, socialization and communication standard scores decreased with increasing age. No relations with age were noted in the ADHD or CON groups. This study adds to the growing body of literature aimed at identifying distinct neurobehavioral profiles of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol and suggests that age may be an important factor for characterizing the differential patterns of deficits seen in children with FASDs. Continued research focused on elucidating the patterns of strengths and weaknesses that exist in alcohol-exposed children ultimately will lead to improved differential diagnosis and effective interventions.

N2  - The main aim of the current research was to investigate strategy application by children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in a multitasking situation. Researchers have obtained evidence that patients with frontal lobe damage and children with ADHD display notable difficulty in multitasking and that this difficulty is associated with their behavioral problems in their daily lives. Given that children with FASD have been shown to have deficits in executive functions, we hypothesized that alcohol-exposed children would show greater difficulty with multitasking than controls and that this difficulty would be associated with parent reported behavior problems. Forty children (20 FASD and 20 typically developing), ages 9 through 17, participated. The two groups were matched with respect to age, sex, and SES. The Six-Part Test (Wilson et al., 1996) was administered to assess multitasking ability as part of a larger test battery that included other tests assessing executive functioning (cognitive planning). In the Six-Part Test, the participants were required to complete, within 5 minutes, three types of tasks, each containing two parts, following specific rules. The Progressive Planning Test was utilized to assess cognitive planning ability. Two parent-rated questionnaires - Dysexecutive Questionnaire for Children (DEX-C) and Social Responsiveness Questionnaire-were employed to obtain information on children's behavior. Contrary to expectation, the groups did not differ on the Six-Part Test, but did differ on the PPT. Furthermore, PPT scores, but not Six-Part Test scores, were associated with parent-rated behavior problems. There is some evidence that the posterior cingulate may be critically involved in multitasking and the dorsolateral frontal cortex, in cognitive planning. Therefore, higher-order cognitive deficits rather than a disinhibitory disorder, like ADHD, seem to underlie behavioral problems in children with FASD.

N2  - Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is a Pavlovian paradigm that involves contingent temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (e.g., pure tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., air puff) that elicits a reflexive blink. In short delay conditioning, a 650-ms delay between the onset of the 750-ms tone and the air puff is presented during the final 100 ms of the tone. EBC was examined in 62 Cape Coloured school-age children in Cape Town, South Africa. Mothers provided pregnancy drinking histories, and dysmorphologists examined the children. 6 children met criteria for full FAS, 3 for PFAS, 25 were heavily exposed nondysmorphic, and 28 were non-exposed controls. Among the 34 children born to heavy drinking mothers, 17.6% met criteria for full FAS, a proportion comparable to that seen in our earlier cohort study. Delay EBC was administered to 62 children at 11.3 yr to assess whether the fetal alcohol-related deficit we reported at 5 yr was seen in a second sample of children at an older age. Two sessions consisting of 50 trials each were administered on the same day. 32 of these children were also administered trace EBC at 12.8 yr. This conditioning procedure is the same as delay except that a 500-ms stimulus-free interval occurs between the offset of the tone and the onset of the air puff. Prenatally exposed children were less likely to meet criterion for delay conditioning than controls, v2 (2) = 8.82, p <.005. Only 33.3% with FAS/PFAS and 44.0% of other heavily exposed met criterion, compared with 78.6% of controls. These data indicate that the EBC impairment seen at 5 yr is also evident in older children. As with delay, the more difficult trace conditioning was also highly sensitive to fetal alcohol exposure. Only 12.5% of the FAS/PFAS and 25% of the heavy exposed met criterion for trace conditioning, compared with 66.7% of the controls. The magnitude of the effect of diagnostic group on trace conditioning was virtually identical to the effect on delay (Cramer's V = .48 vs. .47), suggesting that the impact of fetal alcohol on trace is no greaster than on delay. Recent studies with rats also indicate that delay and trace are equally sensitive to developmental alcohol exposure. These data suggest that alcohol-related impairment in the cerebellar circuitry required for both forms of conditioning is sufficient to account for the alcohol-related deficit in both tasks, although targeting of other brain structures by alcohol cannot be ruled out at this point.

N2  - A sample of 8-11 year old children in Cape Town South Africa, were assessed on the Stewart Extended Continuous Performance Test (E-CPT), which assesses both vigilance and response inhibition. Approximately half of the children were heavily exposed to alcohol in utero; the others were born to women who abstained or drank no more than minimally during pregnancy. In the E-CPT single-digit numbers are displayed sequentially on the screen. The child is instructed to press a button whenever the target number ("9") appears. Trials in which the target appears relatively rarely (e.g., 10% or 30% of the time) assess vigilance; those in which the target appears very frequently (e.g., 70% or 90%) assess response inhibition. In one-third of the trials, the numbers are degraded, making the task more challenging from a perceptual point of view. The fetal alcohol exposed children performed more poorly on the degraded trials, showing poorer vigilance on the 10%, 30%, and 50% trials and poorer response inhibition on the 90% trials. By contrast, the children who were suspect for ADHD based on teacher reports using the Disrupted Behavior Disorders assessment exhibited poorer vigilance and response inhibition on the undegraded trials. The findings that the children who were suspect for ADHD performed more poorly on both the vigilance and response inhibition on the undegraded trials suggests greater sensitivity to deficits in both aspects of attention. By contrast, the children with fetal alcohol exposure showed generally less sensitivity to deficits in both aspects of attention in that their performance was impaired only on the more challenging trials involving the degraded stimuli.

N2  - Academic difficulty has been noted as a secondary disability in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). However, it is unclear if observed school difficulties are disproportionate to the diminished general intellectual function documented in this population. Learning disorders are defined as a significant discrepancy between ability (measured as IQ) and academic achievement. This study conducted two sets of analyses to determine if children with FASDs had increased occurrence of learning disorders in verbal and nonverbal domains. For this study, learning disorder of written expression (verbal domain) was defined as a clinically significant (>1 population standard deviation) difference between verbal (VIQ) and verbal achievement (WRAT-3 Spelling); mathematics learning disorder (nonverbal domain) was similarly defined as a clinically significant difference between nonverbal ability (PIQ) and mathematic achievement (WRAT-3 Arithmetic). In the first analysis, 110 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were compared to 126 non-exposed controls matched on race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status. In the second analysis, 55 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were compared to 55 controls well matched on FSIQ (within 5 points), as well as race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status. In the larger sample, children with FASDs were more likely to have a clinically significant difference between PIQ and WRAT-3 Arithmetic and controls were more likely to have a significant difference between VIQ and WRAT-3 Spelling. However, in the smaller matched sample when IQ was well controlled, a higher occurrence of mathematics learning disorder was observed in children with FASDs but no difference in occurrence of learning disorder of written expression was observed between the groups. These results suggest that children with FASDs may have particular difficulty with nonverbal (arithmetic) academic tasks, while verbal academic ability may be more consistent with overall ability. Nonverbal learning disabilities have been associated with white matter changes in the brain, which also occur following heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Further assessment should be conducted to determine if children with FASDs have additional deficits (e.g. visuospatial) consistent with nonverbal learning disability and whether these neuropsychological deficits relate to changes in white matter.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can alter physical, neurological, and behavioral development, resulting in a range of effects referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The outcome among children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy varies widely and some of this variation may be due to nutritional factors. For example, higher rates of FASD are observed in areas where malnutrition is prevalent. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that many women throughout the world may not consume adequate levels of choline, a nutrient that is critical for brain development, during pregnancy. In this study we examined whether choline deficiency might increase the severity of fetal alcohol effects. Sprague-Dawley female rats were randomly assigned to receive diets containing 40, 70 or 100 percent recommended choline levels from two weeks prior to pregnancy through weaning at postnatal day 21. A group from each diet condition was exposed to alcohol (6.0 g/kg/day) from gestational day 5 to 20 via intragastric intubations. Pair-fed and ad lib lab chow control groups were also included. The offspring were examined for physical development and tested on a range of behavioral tasks. Neither prenatal alcohol exposure nor choline deficient diets by themselves produced robust alterations in development. However, subjects exposed to alcohol prenatally and fed a 40% choline-deficient diet exhibited significant delays in eye opening, impaired hind-limb coordination, and hyperactivity. Outcome measures of subjects exposed to alcohol and fed a 70% choline diet was not significantly different from that of alcohol-exposed subjects fed a 100% recommended choline diet. These data indicate that even moderate suboptimal nutritional status may exacerbate some of ethanol's teratogenic effects, a finding with important implications for the prevention of FASD.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can damage the developing CNS, leading to hyperactivity, motor incoordination, and deficits in cognitive functioning. Prenatal exposure to binge-like ethanol, which is characterized by withdrawal periods, is more damaging than continuous exposure. We have hypothesized that NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity occurs during these withdrawal periods, contributing to ethanol-related neuropathology and behavioral deficits. Consistent with this hypothesis, blocking NMDA receptors during withdrawal with MK-801, a potent NMDA receptor antagonist, reduces the severity of alcohol-related neuropathology in the developing rat. However, when administered at the same time as ethanol, MK-801 exacerbates ethanol's teratogenic effects. The present study examined the effects of administering eliprodil, an NMDAR antagonist that acts on the polyamine modulator site, at various times following an ethanol binge. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of seven treatment groups: five alcohol-exposed (AE) (6 g/kg via intubation on postnatal day (PD) 6) and two sham intubation control (IC) groups. Four AE groups were injected with 5 mg/kg eliprodil at 0, 9, 21, or 33 hrs post-ethanol; the fifth AE group was injected with vehicle 21 hrs postethanol. Each IC group was injected with either eliprodil or vehicle, 21 hrs post-ethanol. Subjects were tested for open field activity (PD18-21) and parallel bar motor coordination (PD30-32). Ethanol exposure produced hyperactivity and motor incoordination. Eliprodil administration at 21 hrs post-ethanol, during ethanol withdrawal, significantly ameliorated ethanol-induced hyperactivity, but was not effective at any other time point. Administering eliprodil did not ameliorate ethanol-induced motor incoordination, indicating that its beneficial effects are task-specific. These data provide further evidence that NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity occurs during periods of withdrawal following developmental alcohol exposure. Furthermore, eliprodil did not exacerbate ethanol's effects when administered at 0 or 9 hrs post-ethanol, therefore unlike MK-801, eliprodil is not toxic when administered during alcohol intoxication. These findings indicate that administration of NMDAR antagonists that act at the polyamine modulatory site, may serve as relatively safe and effective interventions for some fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy produces fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and studies suggest that alterations in the expression brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are involved in its etiology. However, little is known about the role of changes in BDNF function on FASD pathophysiology. Recent studies indicate that BDNF-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity play a role in the development of inhibitory synaptic connections. Activitydependent release of BDNF from CA3 pyramidal neurons activates TrkB receptors causing long-term potentiation (LTP) of GABAergic transmission, expressed as an increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABA-A receptor-dependent spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sGABA-A-sPSCs; Gubellini et al., J Neurosci. 25:5796-802, 2005). This form of synaptic plasticity is restricted to the neonatal period of rat development, which is equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. We hypothesized that this sGABA-A-sPSCs LTP is affected by ethanol exposure during this developmental period. To test this hypothesis, we exposed neonatal rat pups with their mothers to air or ethanol between postnatal days (P) 2 and 8 for 4 hours per day (peak serum ethanol concentrations = 40-50 mM). Immediately after the end of the 4 hr exposure, neonatal rats were euthanized and brain coronal slices were then prepared. After a recovery time of 1.5-6 hrs, sGABA-A-PSCs were recorded from CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in presence of kynurenate (1mM) at a holding potential of -65 mV before and after the application of 20 depolarizing pulses (500 ms each, from -85 to 0) delivered at 0.1 Hz. The pulses induced sGABA-A-PSC LTP in slices from neonates exposed to air but not those exposed to ethanol and this effect was reversible 48 hrs after ethanol withdrawal. Bath application of BDNF induced sGABA-A-PSC LTP to a similar extend in both treatment groups, suggesting that TrkB receptor function is unaffected by ethanol and that it rather acts by inhibiting release of endogenous BDNF. These alterations in BDNF-dependent plasticity may impair normal GABAergic synapse development and be a cellular underpinning of the learning and memory alterations that are associated with FASD.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal exposure to alcohol has been shown to alter the levels of biogenic amines in several regions of the brain. In vitro studies have revealed damage the serotonin (5-HT) system in the brain during the course of neural development. Early life impairment of this system has been linked to behavioral abnormalities and may be related to behaviors often displayed by individuals born with fetal alcohol (FA) exposure. Positron emission tomography (PET) neuroligand imaging is ideally suited to investigate in vivo changes in the serotonin system caused by fetal alcohol exposure. The goal of this work is to investigate the imaging characteristics of a promising 5-HT1A serotonin neuroligand, [F-18]mefway, for measuring potential neurochemical alterations in subjects receiving prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: High resolution PET scans were acquired in the rhesus monkey using [F-18]mefway and compared to the in vivo kinetics of [F-18]MPPF, another more commonly used 5-HT1A PET ligand. The time course of the radiotracer kinetics were followed over the course of 2 hours and arterial plasma samples were acquired to assay the fraction of parent radiotracer. Results: [F-18]Mefway revealed high uptake in the regions of the hippocampus, raphe nuclei and cingulate gyrus. The specifically bound to free (B/F) ratios in these regions was approximately 2-fold greater with [F-18]mefway (B/F = 8 in hippocampus) and approached a pseudo-equilibrium at approximately 60 minutes, suggesting stable measurements of specific binding will be achievable within a reasonable time period (< 2 hours). Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest [F-18]mefway possesses superior imaging characteristics to [F-18]MPPF and will improve the sensitivity for detecting group differences in 5-HT1A binding. Work is ongoing to investigate a cohort of rhesus monkeys receiving prenatal alcohol exposure. [F-18]Mefway PET imaging holds great promise for studying FA-exposure on the development of the 5-HT1A receptors within the serotonergic network of the brain.

N2  - Emerging information indicates that epigenetic modification regulates maintenance and differentiation of neural stem cells. Alcohol abuse during pregnancy attributable to neurodevelopmental deficits and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is known to link with alteration in methyl and acetyl donors, thus epigenetic processes may have a causal input for FAS. In this study, through monitoring both neural tube and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neural stem cell development, we demonstrated the dynamic nature of epigenetic marks throughout neural differentiation, and that alcohol interferes with these epigenetic and developmental processes. The DNA methylation in the neural tube were found to be increased along the differentiation of the neural tube in spatial and temporal pattern as indicated by the markers, 5 Methyl cytosine (5meC) and DNA methyl transferase (DNMT). Alcohol exposure at the stage of neurulation deterred DNA methylation pattern of the neural tube and concurrently the neural tube development. The DRG stem cells also demonstrated epigenetic change as waking from quiescent into differentiating states. The modification of DNA methylation and histone marks was in parallel with phenotype changes. Alcohol inhibited genome-wide DNA hypermethylation and meanwhile affected migration and differentiation. Alcohol also altered nuclear distribution of DNA methylation and histone methylation marks. In verifying the rule of DNA methylation, inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-Aza-cystidine were found to severely disrupt migration and differentiation of DRG stem cells. These results indicate that alcohol alters epigenetic programming while affecting neural differentiation. The causal relationship of epigenetic changes and neural differentiation by alcohol however requires further investigation (support AA016698).

N2  - Objective. To describe the prevalence, characteristics and risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS among schoolgoing children in Grade 1 in Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Design. A cross-sectional study using a two-tiered method for ascertainment of FAS/partial FAS cases, comprising: screening of growth parameters, diagnostic assessment for screen-positive children using clinical and neurocognitive assessments, and maternal history of drinking during pregnancy. Mothers or caregivers of FAS children and matched controls were interviewed. Setting. Primary schools in De Aar (8) and Upington (15). Subjects. Grade 1 pupils in 2001 (De Aar, N=536) and 2002 (Upington, N=1 299). Outcome measures. FAS or partial FAS. Results. The prevalence of FAS/partial FAS was high: 64/536 (119.4/1 000, 95% CI 93.2 - 149.9) in De Aar, and 97/1 299 (74.7/1 000, 95% CI 61.0 - 90.3) in Upington. Overall, 67.2 per 1 000 children (95% CI 56.2 - 79.7) had full FAS features. Growth retardation was also common in this population: 66.6% (1 181/1 774) were underweight, 48.3% (858/1 776) stunted, and 15.1% had a head circumference <2 SD for age. Mothers of children with FAS were less likely to have fulltime employment or have attended secondary school and had lower body mass index, and about 80% currently smoked. Over two-thirds of all pregnancies had been unplanned. Conclusions. A very high proportion of pupils (nearly 1 in 10) had FAS/ partial FAS, the rate in De Aar being the highest yet described in South Africa. FAS/partial FAS may contribute to the extremely high rate of growth retardation in South Africa as a whole and is a major cause of learning disability. These epidemiological features are important in designing preventive interventions.

N2  - Heavy fetal alcohol exposure is associated with a spectrum of neurological abnormalities, although the mechanism of injury is largely unknown. We previously reported attenuated cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia in fetal and newborn sheep which were exposed to alcohol earlier in pregnancy. One possible mechanism for this effect of alcohol on the developing cerebral vasculature is a decrease in cerebral microvessel density, similar to its effect on developing neurons. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal alcohol exposure decreases cerebral microvessel density. Pregnant ewes received intravenous infusions of ethanol or saline during days 60-84 of gestation (term = 150 days) and at 125 days of gestation we obtained the fetal brains for study. We immunohistochemically labeled vessels of the left cerebral forebrain hemispheres with antibody to endothelial nitric oxide synthase and then obtained unbiased stereological estimates of cerebral microvessel density using a modified optical fractionator method. We studied 20 fetal brains of which 9 were alcohol-exposed, 11 were saline-controls, and all were products of a twin gestation. Although brain and body weights were not different between groups, the alcohol-exposed group had significantly lower brain weight as a percentage of body weight. Estimates of cerebral microvessel density were not significantly different between alcohol-exposed and saline-control groups: 12.7 +/- 8.7 and 9.1 +/- 2.8 microvessels per mm3, respectively (mean +/- SD, p = 0.32). Since there is no change in estimated cerebral microvessel density after prenatal alcohol exposure, we conclude that decreased cerebral microvessel density is not a likely explanation for attenuated cerebral blood flow in response to hypoxia. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: A multi-state consortium was developed in the US to conduct baseline data collection and intervention research on fetal alcohol syndrome. Each state employed support specialists whose job it was to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption in women who were at high risk for drinking alcohol during their pregnancy. The purpose of this paper is to report how support specialists in three primarily rural/frontier states were trained to assess client need and how client need was actually assessed in the field. Methods: A qualitative process evaluation was conducted using semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted with state staff involved in support specialist training and consortium activities and the support specialists themselves. Inductive analyses were conducted with interview data. Results: Need determination varied by state and for one state within the state. How support specialists were trained to assess need and how need was assessed in the field was mostly congruent. Conclusion: Process evaluation is an effective method for providing practical and useful answers to questions that cannot be answered by outcome evaluation alone. © 2007 Christopher et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether fetal alcohol exposure contributes to alcohol use in adolescence. In this study, we examine the association between maternal alcohol use in pregnancy and adolescents' drinking patterns at age 14. METHODS: The association of maternal alcohol exposure with early drinking was examined in 4363 adolescents taking part to the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) and its outcomes, a population based birth cohort study commenced in Brisbane (Australia) in 1981. Mothers and children were followed up at birth, 5 and 14 years after the initial interview. Maternal alcohol use was assessed before and during pregnancy and at the 5 years follow-up. Adolescents' alcohol use was assessed at child age 14. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis those born of mothers who consumed 3+ glasses during pregnancy were at increased risk to report drinking 3+ glasses compared with those whose mothers reported no drinking or drinking up to 2 glasses. Comparisons controlling for drinking before pregnancy and at age 5 found the averaged odds ratio of maternal drinking in pregnancy on risk of reporting alcohol consumption of 3 and more glasses at age 14 was 2.74 (CI 1.70, 4.22). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that they maybe a biological origin of early drinking. Further studies are needed to better disentangle the nature of the association and the role of other possible confounding factors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the most common form of nongenetic birth defect in North America with devastating, long-term consequences. Physicians are the primary providers of medical care for pregnant women and they play an important role in the prevention and diagnosis of FASD. We sought to determine whether differences exist between rural and urban health care providers in knowledge of, attitudes about and awareness of FASD and preconception counselling. METHODS: Surveys were mailed to a national, random sample of Canadian health care providers (n = 5361) between October 2001 and May 2002. Bivariate data analysis was completed using SPSS 14.0. RESULTS: Compared with their urban counterparts, rural providers were more likely to report being prepared to access resources related to alcohol use and dependency, yet they were less likely to agree that it was the physician's role to manage these issues (78.4% v. 82.8%, p < 0.05). Rural providers were more likely than urban providers to use a standardized tool to screen patients for alcohol use, to ask all pregnant women if they were drinking, to have cared for a patient with an FASD (56.7% v. 48.8%), to agree that providers do not make a diagnosis because of lack of time and training, and to recognize legal issues and inappropriate behaviour as secondary outcomes of FASD. Rural and urban providers were similar in their diagnostic knowledge of FASD. CONCLUSION: Few differences between rural and urban providers exist with regard to knowledge and diagnosis of FASD; however, rural providers are more prepared to access resources for women with addiction issues and are more likely to care for patients with an FASD.

T1  - The effectiveness of a multimedia program to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Lachausse R.G.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) continues to be the leading preventable cause of mental retardation in the United States. Because abstaining from alcohol prior to and throughout pregnancy is the only way to prevent FAS, some prevention programs try to target women before they become pregnant. The Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Teaching and Research Awareness Campaign (FASTRAC) is a multimedia, peer-delivered educational presentation designed to reduce the incidence of FAS. Results from an ethnically diverse sample of high school students indicate that the program increased participants' knowledge regarding FAS but had no significant effect on participants' attitudes, beliefs about the dangers of FAS or intention to use alcohol during pregnancy. The FASTRAC program failed partly because of its didactic approach and the lack of health education principles that have been shown to be effective in changing other substance use behaviors. Suggestions for improving FAS prevention education programs are offered.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Preventing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) by encouraging pregnant women to abstain from drinking alcohol competes with commercial alcohol marketing. Two FAS-prevention campaigns using a narrowcast approach among young women of childbearing age in two disadvantaged Southern California communities are compared. The design, implementation process, and degree to which campaigns reached the priority populations are the focus of this article. Formative research shows that young women in disadvantaged communities receive mixed messages about dangers of drinking during pregnancy. A social norms approach using positive role models was the most acceptable message strategy based on materials pretesting. Differences in campaign implementation and distribution strategies between communities were documented through program monitoring. Survey research indicated the more viable messaging and implementation strategies. Findings show that low-cost community campaigns are feasible; however, variations in messaging, distribution strategies, and saturation levels determine whether such campaigns succeed or fail to reach priority populations.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can seriously harm the fetus, dependent on time, duration and frequency of exposure. The variety of outcomes is subsumed under the term <> (FASD). Diagnostic classification by means of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code results from the occurence of four key characteristics: Growth retardation, facial anomalies, CNS abnormalities (microcephaly, mental retardation, functional problems and behavioral problems) and prenatal alcohol exposure. As the facial characteristics are often discrete, the focus lies on the behavioral problems. Foster parents (most of the affected children do not stay with their biological parents) are overstrained by the everyday life with their alcohol affected children. An early diagnosis is necessary to release the foster families and to develop an appropriate concept for supporting the children according to their capabilities. Therefore a supportive network of attending pediatricians, <>, therapists and youth welfare offices with specific support for foster parents. This network aims at avoiding the adverse development and the multiple punishment of the affected children by brain dysfunction, postnatal traumatic experiences in the birth families and the danger of anew breakups of relationships due to the serious behavioral problems. Primary prevention, multigenerational projects and the acceptance of FASD as a disability pose a challenge to the whole society.

N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy leads to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in their children. FASD is characterized by typical facial features, growth retardation, intellectual dysfunction and behavioral problems. Justification: Alcohol is neurotoxic to the brain during the developmental stage. Behavioral problems in children with FASD start at an early age and progress to adulthood. It is an important preventable cause of intellectual dysfunction and behavioral problems. This article reviews current prevalence, clinical features, pathogenesis and differential diagnosis of FASD. It also highlights the need for physicians to be aware of this condition. Search strategy: Articles were searched on the internet using 'fetal alcohol syndrome', 'fetal alcohol spectrum disorders', 'women and alcohol'. Following links were used to locate journals; EBSCO, OVID, Science Direct, PubMed and NIAAA. Main conclusions: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a spectrum of deficits. Though physical features are essential to make the diagnosis of FAS, it is important to note that neurocognitive and behavioural deficits can be present in the absence of physical features (alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder or ARND). Because there is no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, abstinence from alcohol for women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy must be strongly advised.

N2  - Objective: Although the classic features of fetal alcohol syndrome have been recognized since 1968, research on alcohol teratogenesis has only recently demonstrated that the brain is the organ in the body most vulnerable to the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. In this present article, we reviewed the literature focusing mainly on behavioral disturbances related to prenatal ethanol exposure. Sources: We performed a PubMed search on the literature published between 1968 and 2006 using the terms ethanol, pregnancy and behavior. We limited our search to studies on humans. Summary of the findings: The data presented in this review suggested that youths with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are at risk of disruptive social behavior, among other neurobehavioral abnormalities. Conclusions: Although it is still impossible to completely separate brain teratogenesis secondary to alcohol exposure from environmental postnatal influences as the definite cause for these outcomes, the pediatrician should be encouraged to early diagnose children affected by fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This provides proper management and care and avoids long-term consequences on their behavior, besides ensuring better and productive school and social adaptation.

N2  - Ethanol is now considered the most common human teratogen. Educational campaigns have not reduced the incidence of ethanol-mediated teratogenesis, leading to a growing interest in the development of therapeutic prevention or mitigation strategies. On the basis of the observation that maternal ethanol consumption reduces maternal and fetal pH, we hypothesized that a pH-sensitive pathway involving the TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium channels (TASKs) is implicated in ethanol-induced injury to the fetal cerebellum, one of the most sensitive targets of prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant ewes were intravenously infused with ethanol (258 +/- 10 mg/dl peak blood ethanol concentration) or saline in a "3 days/wk binge" pattern throughout the third trimester. Quantitative stereological analysis demonstrated that ethanol resulted in a 45% reduction in the total number of fetal cerebellar Purkinje cells, the cell type most sensitive to developmental ethanol exposure. Extracellular pH manipulation to create the same degree and pattern of pH fall caused by ethanol (manipulations large enough to inhibit TASK 1 channels), resulted in a 24% decrease in Purkinje cell number. We determined immunohistochemically that TASK 1 channels are expressed in Purkinje cells and that the TASK 3 isoform is expressed in granule cells of the ovine fetal cerebellum. Pharmacological blockade of both TASK 1 and TASK 3 channels simultaneous with ethanol effectively prevented any reduction in fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell number. These results demonstrate for the first time functional significance of fetal cerebellar two-pore domain pH-sensitive channels and establishes them as a potential therapeutic target for prevention of ethanol teratogenesis.

N2  - Background: Although a large body of literature exists on cognitive functioning in alcohol-exposed children, it is unclear if there is a signature neuropsychological profile in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study assesses cognitive functioning in children with FASD from several American Indian reservations in the Northern Plains States, and it applies a hierarchical model of simple versus complex information processing to further examine cognitive function. We hypothesized that complex tests would discriminate between children with FASD and culturally similar controls, while children with FASD would perform similar to controls on relatively simple tests. Methods: Our sample includes 32 control children and 24 children with a form of FASD [fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) = 10, partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) = 14]. The test battery measures general cognitive ability, verbal fluency, executive functioning, memory, and fine-motor skills. Results: Many of the neuropsychological tests produced results consistent with a hierarchical model of simple versus complex processing. The complexity of the tests was determined "a priori" based on the number of cognitive processes involved in them. Multidimensional scaling was used to statistically analyze the accuracy of classifying the neurocognitive tests into a simple versus complex dichotomy. Hierarchical logistic regression models were then used to define the contribution made by complex versus simple tests in predicting the significant differences between children with FASD and controls. Complex test items discriminated better than simple test items. The tests that conformed well to the model were the Verbal Fluency, Progressive Planning Test (PPT), the Lhermitte memory tasks, and the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT). The FASD-grouped children, when compared with controls, demonstrated impaired performance on letter fluency, while their performance was similar on category fluency. On the more complex PPT trials (problems 5 to 8), as well as the Lhermitte logical tasks, the FASD group performed the worst. Conclusions: The differential performance between children with FASD and controls was evident across various neuropsychological measures. The children with FASD performed significantly more poorly on the complex tasks than did the controls. The identification of a neurobehavioral profile in children with prenatal alcohol exposure will help clinicians identify and diagnose children with FASD. © Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Chronic binge ethanol-mediated acidemia reduces availability of glutamine and related amino acids in maternal plasma of pregnant sheep

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Heavy drinking during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), of which, fetal and postnatal growth retardation and central nervous system deficits are cardinal features. Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed, none fully account for these deficiencies. We have previously reported that maternal ethanol exposure (1.75 g/kg) results in transient acidemia in the mother and fetus. Alterations in pH are known to regulate glutamine homeostasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that chronic binge ethanol-mediated acidosis reduces glutamine concentrations in maternal plasma that result in decreases in the circulating levels of amino acids related to glutamine metabolism. Pregnant ewes were divided into three groups: ethanol (1.75 g/kg), saline control, and acidemia (inspired fractional carbon dioxide [CO2] was manipulated to mimic the maternal arterial pH pattern created by ethanol). The experiment was conducted on three consecutive days followed by four days without treatment beginning on gestational day (GD) 109, continuing to GD 132. Plasma samples were analyzed for nutrients and metabolites using HPLC and spectrophotometric methods. Maternal plasma concentrations of glutamate increased (58%), whereas glutamine, citrulline, and arginine decreased (between 14 and 53%) in response to an acute challenge after the chronic exposure in ethanol-treated ewes. No differences in these amino acid concentrations were noted between the ethanol and acidemic group subjects. Maternal plasma lactate levels increased by ~100% in response to ethanol, whereas glucose and urea levels did not change in any group. We conclude that maternal chronic binge ethanol consumption results in acidosis-mediated reductions in circulating levels of glutamine and related amino acids that could be responsible for neuronal deficits, altered fetal growth, development, and programming. We also speculate that the consequent increase in fetal glutamate during critical periods of brain development may contribute to the pathogenesis of FAS. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Cell proliferation and differentiation are critical processes in a developing fetal rat brain, during which programmed cell death (PCD) also plays an important role. One of the decisive factors for PCD is Bcl-2 family proteins, where Bax induces cell death, whereas Bcl-2 acts as an inhibitor of PCD. As maternal drinking is known to cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or malformation of the fetal brain during pregnancy, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether maternal ethanol exposure alters the PCD-related Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression during fetal brain development. Pregnant female rats were orally treated with 10% ethanol and the subsequent expressions of the Bax and Bcl-2 proteins examined in the fetal brain, including the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, from gestational day (GD) 15.5 to GD 19.5, using Western blots, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. With regard to the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax proteins (Bcl-2/Bax), the Bax protein was dominant in the forebrain and midbrain of the control GD 15.5 fetuses, except for the hindbrain, when compared with the respective ethanol-treated groups. Moreover, Bcl-2 became dominant in the midbrain of the control GD 17.5 fetuses when compared with the ethanol-treated group, representing an alternation of the natural PCD process by ethanol. Furthermore, a differential expression of the Bcl-2 and Bax proteins was found in the differentiating and migrating zones of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Thus, when taken together, the present results suggest that ethanol affects PCD in the cell differentiation and migration zones of the prenatal rat brain by modulating Bax and Bcl-2 expression in an age- and area-dependent manner. Therefore, this is the first evidence that ethanol may alter FAS-associated embryonic brain development through the alteration of Bax and Bcl-2 expression. © The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

N2  - Introduction: The present review describes the different variants of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) as a consequence of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. According to international findings, some 3 000 to 4 000 affected newborns may be expected annually in Germany. Detection of these individuals in clinical practise is insufficient. Method: Selective review of the literature and report of own findings based on long-term outcome studies. Results: Key features of FASD are short stature, microcephaly, various dysmorphic features, in severe cases amongst others consisting of congenital heart disease and dysplasias of the skeleton and urogenital system, varying degrees of developmental delay including mental retardation, and a positive history of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. Long-term outcome studies in young adulthood show that independent of the severity of FASD the key features remain associated with limitations of an independent life-style. Discussion: Pathogenesis of FASD is not sufficiently clear and there is no causal treatment. Thus, besides prevention and information, early diagnosis, installation of fostering or adoption, and intensive psychosocial care including selection of appropriate schooling, occupational counselling and supportive care in adulthood are mandatory. © Deutscher Arzte-Verlag; entwickelt von L.N.

N2  - Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) show deficits in verbal learning and spatial memory, as well as abnormal hippocampal development. The relationship between their memory and neuroanatomic impairments, however, has not been directly explored. Given that the hippocampus is integral for the synthesis and retrieval of learned information and is particularly vulnerable to the teratogenic effects of alcohol, we assessed whether reduced learning and recall abilities in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are associated with abnormal hippocampal volumes. Nineteen children with FASDs and 18 typically developing controls aged 9 to 15 years were assessed for verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall and underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Images were analyzed for total intracranial volume and for right and left hippocampal volumes. Results revealed smaller left hippocampi and poorer verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall performance in children with FASDs than controls, as well as positive correlations between selective memory indices and hippocampal volumes only in the FASD group. Additionally, hippocampal volumes increased significantly with age in controls only, suggesting that PAE may be associated with long-term abnormalities in hippocampal development that may contribute to impaired verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall. © 2008 INS.

N2  - Background: The precise pathway by which alcohol causes the characteristic features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is unknown. Proposed mechanisms for fetal injury from maternal alcohol use include cellular damage from oxidative stress and impaired fetal oxygenation related to maternal systemic vasoconstriction. Our objective was to compare the levels of urinary markers of oxidative stress and systemic vasoconstriction between women consuming large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy and women who did not drink alcohol during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women consuming >48 g alcohol per day (n = 29) on average and pregnant women who abstained from alcohol use (n = 39) were identified using detailed interviews and home visits. Random maternal urine specimens were collected. Urinary levels of the oxidative stress marker, 8-isoprostane F2alpha, and of the vasoactive prostaglandin metabolites, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (a vasodilator) and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (a vasoconstrictor), were measured using mass spectrometric methods. All analyte levels were corrected for urinary creatinine. Results: In crude analyses, there was no significant difference in 8-isoprostane F2alpha between pregnant drinkers and nondrinkers (2.16 vs. 2.08 ng/mg creatinine, respectively, p = 0.87). There were no significant differences between the drinking and nondrinking groups in levels of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (1.03 vs. 1.17 ng/mg creatinine, repectively, p = 0.50), 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (0.72 vs. 0.59 ng/mg creatinine, respectively, p = 0.21), or the ratio of vasodilatory metabolite to vasoconstrictive metabolite (1.73 vs. 2.72, respectively, p = 0.14). Adjusting for maternal age, marital status, smoking, and gestational age at sampling did not substantially alter the results. Conclusion: Our results show no difference in levels of urinary eicosanoid markers of oxidative stress and systemic vasoconstriction between pregnant women who drink heavily and pregnant women who abstain. These findings speak against a role for maternal oxidative stress or systemic vasoconstriction in the pathogenesis of alcohol damage to the fetus.

N2  - Introduction: Characteristics of Northern Plains American Indian maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or incomplete FAS are described to more effectively prevent fetal FAS and alcohol use during pregnancy. Methods: Study 1 had 27 maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with FAS and Study 2 had 18 grandmothers with grandchildren who had incomplete FAS (cases) which were compared with 119 maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren without FAS (controls). The grandchildren were born between 1981 and 1993 on the Northern Plains. Medical records were manually reviewed for each case and control grandmother. Data were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel chi square. Results: Study 1 case grandmothers were more likely to experience medical problems (70.4%) including trauma (48.1%) and injuries (51.9%) than the controls. Most of the Study 1 and 2 case grandmothers (92.6% and 77.8%, respectively) had alcohol use documented in their medical records compared to less than half of the control grandmothers. Seven (15.6%) of the case grandmothers had more than one grandchild in either Study 1 or Study 2. Conclusion: Maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with FAS had significantly higher rates of alcohol use and alcohol-related medical problems than control grandmothers. Antenatal care providers should screen pregnant women for alcohol use at their first visit. The provider needs to ask the women who are using alcohol about their mothers' use of alcohol to provide appropriate care and counseling for the women and prevent FAS. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Women giving birth to children with fetal alcohol syndrome have a higher risk of early mortality. However, the risk of increased mortality associated with drinking at lower levels during pregnancy has not been evaluated previously. Accordingly, mortality at 20 years post recruitment was examined in a sample (N = 570) of women recruited between 1980 and 1986, who drank more than 1 ounce of absolute alcohol per week (oz AA/wk) during pregnancy and compared to that in abstainers from the same low socioeconomic, African-American population. Using data from archival information and state mortality records, Cox proportional hazards survival models were constructed to determine whether alcohol use, cigarette use, infant birth weight, infant dysmorphia, and alcohol use and abuse by the woman's own mother (family history positive) were associated with increased risk for mortality. At follow-up (in 2003), 9.5% of the sample had died, with the rate for controls being 3.6%, for those alcohol users who stopped during pregnancy, 12.7%, and for the alcohol users who continued drinking throughout pregnancy, 12.5%. Thus, women using alcohol in pregnancy, whether they stopped or continued to use, were significantly (chi2 (2) = 12.1, P < .01) more likely than abstainers to have died before follow-up. Nondrinkers' mortality rate was lower than that of other women from this low-income, high-risk population, whereas the drinkers' rate was 2.7 times higher. In a multivariate analysis, factors contributing to mortality risk included alcohol use and cigarette smoking, but not infant birth weight. Drinking at any level during pregnancy should be regarded as a risk factor for the mother as well as for offspring. Health care professionals working with such women should provide counseling and support for abstinence. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure causes abnormal brain development, leading to behavioral deficits, some of which can be ameliorated by environmental enrichment. As both environmental enrichment and prenatal alcohol exposure can individually alter neurotrophin expression, we studied the interaction of prenatal alcohol and postweaning environmental enrichment on brain neurotrophin levels in rats. Methods: Pregnant rats received alcohol by gavage, 0, 4, or 6 g/kg/d (Zero, Low, or High groups), or no treatment (Naive group), on gestational days 8 to 20. After weaning on postnatal day 21, offspring were housed for 6 weeks in Isolated, Social, or Enriched conditions. Levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) were then measured in frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar vermis. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure increased NGF levels in frontal cortex (High-dose group) and cerebellar vermis (High- and Low-dose groups); increased BDNF in frontal cortex, occipital cortex and hippocampus (Low-dose groups), and increased NT-3 in hippocampus and cerebellar vermis (High-dose). Environmental enrichment resulted in lower NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 levels in occipital cortex and lower NGF in frontal cortex. The only significant interaction between prenatal alcohol treatment and environment was in cerebellar vermis where NT-3 levels were higher for enriched animals after prenatal alcohol exposure, but not for animals housed under Isolated or Social conditions. Conclusions: Both prenatal alcohol exposure and postweaning housing conditions alter brain neurotrophin levels, but the effects appear to be largely independent. Although environmental enrichment can improve functional outcomes, these results do not provide strong support for the hypothesis that rearing in a complex environment ameliorates prenatal alcohol effects on brain neurotrophin levels in rats.

N2  - Background: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments, including structural brain damage. Despite the importance of white matter connections for proper brain function, little is known about how these connections, and the deep gray matter structures that act as relay stations, are affected in children with FASD. The purpose of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging, an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique, to examine microstructural differences of white and deep gray matter in children with FASD. Methods: Subjects were 24 children aged 5-13 years previously diagnosed with FASD and 95 healthy children over the same age range. Diffusion tractography was used to delineate 10 major white matter tracts in each individual, and region-of-interest analysis was used to assess 4 deep gray matter structures. Fractional anisotropy, an indicator of white matter integrity, and mean diffusivity, a measure of the average water diffusion, were assessed in all 14 brain structures. Results: Diffusion tensor imaging revealed significant differences of diffusion parameters in several areas of the brain, including the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, cingulum, corticospinal tracts, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, globus pallidus, putamen, and thalamus. Reduced white and gray matter volumes, as well as total brain volume, were observed in the FASD group. Conclusions: These results demonstrate diffusion abnormalities in FASD beyond the corpus callosum and suggest that several specific white matter regions, particularly commissural and temporal connections, and deep gray matter areas of the brain are sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Maternal drinking during pregnancy can lead to a range of deleterious outcomes in the developing offspring that have been collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). There is interest and recognized value in using non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to characterize, respectively, structural and biochemical alterations in individuals with FASDs. To date, however, results with MRS have been inconsistent regarding the degree and/or nature of abnormalities. Methods: High-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) proton (1H) MRS is an ex vivo neuroimaging technique that can acquire spectra in small punches of intact tissue, providing clinically relevant neurochemical information about discrete brain regions. In this study, HR-MAS 1H MRS was used to examine regional neurochemistry in frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum of young rats previously exposed to ethanol as neonates. Key neurochemicals of interest included N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glutamate, GABA, glutamine, creatine, choline and myo-inositol. Results: Daily neonatal alcohol exposure from postnatal day 4 (PN4) through PN9 significantly reduced levels of NAA and taurine in the cerebellum and striatum, and induced sex-dependent reductions in cerebellar glutamate when measured on PN16. In addition, myo-inositol was significantly increased in cerebellum. The frontal cortex and hippocampus were virtually unaffected by this neonatal alcohol exposure. Conclusion: Results of this research may have implications for understanding the underlying neurobiology associated with FASDs and aid in testing treatments in the future. Ongoing studies are assessing the developmental persistence of and/or maturational recovery from these changes. Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - A diagnostically promising technique for tallying nominal reference errors in the narratives of school-aged children with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)
A1  - Thorne J.C.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background: Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) include the range of disabilities that occur in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy, with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) on the severe end of the spectrum. Clinical research has documented a range of cognitive, social, and communication deficits in FASD and it indicates the need for diagnostic tools that can identify children with diminished communicative capacities resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Previous research indicates that analysis of nominal reference errors within narrative discourse may provide such a tool. Aims: To demonstrate the potential diagnostic utility of a new tool for tallying nominal reference errors in the oral narratives of school-aged children with FASD by presenting quantitative measurement data that address interrater agreement and predictive accuracy. Methods and Procedures: Retrospective analysis was conducted on spontaneously produced oral narratives from 32 school-aged children (8;5-11;7) with a range of socio-economic and ethnic profiles. Sixteen of the children had been previously diagnosis with an FASD, including five with full or partial FAS (pFAS). The remaining 16 children were considered typically developing (TD). A range of methods for calculating the rate of nominal reference errors (rNRE) were used to predict which narratives were produced by children from each group. Accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) for two predictions (FASD versus TD, and FAS/pFAS versus all others) was quantified using receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses. Pairwise statistical comparisons were made between methods to determine which had the most diagnostic potential. Outcomes and Results: The proposed system for calculating the rNRE was highly accurate at predicting which narratives were produced by children with FASD (versus TD, 88% overall accuracy), and which were produced by children with FAS/pFAS (versus all others, 97% overall accuracy), and outperformed all other methods tested. Agreement on coding decisions between independent judges was high (kappa=0.90). Conclusions: The strong predictive accuracy demonstrated in this study provides empirical evidence that the system proposed in this feasibility study has sufficient sensitivity and diagnostic utility to warrant further development for use with children suspected of prenatal alcohol exposure. It also points to the potential for the tool to be used with other clinical populations that, even in the absence of a confirmed alcohol exposure, share many of the communication challenges of this complex clinical population. © 2008 Royal College of Speech & Language Therapists.

N2  - Background: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have documented impairments in executive functioning (EF). One component of EF, concept formation, has not been well studied in this group. Methods: Children (8 to 18 years) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with and without fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), were compared to typically developing controls on 2 measures of concept formation and conceptual set shifting: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the Card Sorting Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System. In addition to between-group comparisons, performance relative to overall intellectual functioning was examined. Results: Children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure showed impairment on both tests of concept formation compared to non-exposed controls. These deficits included difficulty generating and verbalizing concepts, increased error rates and perseverative responses, and poorer response to feedback. However, in comparison to controls, alcohol-exposed children performed better on measures of concept formation than predicted by their overall IQ scores. Exploratory analyses suggest that this may be due to differences in how the measures relate at different IQ levels and may not be specific to prenatal alcohol exposure. Conclusions: Deficits in concept formation and conceptual set shifting were observed in alcohol-exposed children with or without the diagnosis of FAS and in the absence of mental retardation. These deficits likely impact problem solving skills and adaptive functioning and have implications for therapeutic interventions in this population.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: New Zealand birth mothers' experiences
A1  - Salmon J.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The aim of this study was to describe the 'lived' experiences of New Zealand birth mothers, from pregnancy onwards, of a child/ren diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Method: A qualitative paradigm was utilized so that the participants could tell their stories through words and text rather than collecting statistical data which is the domain of quantitative research. The adoption of a feminist standpoint theory bridged a communication gap, adjusted the balance of power within society and gave visibility and voice to the women. Eight New Zealand-resident multipara biological mothers ages 18 and over, who had nurtured or were still living with their affected offspring, were studied. Their ages ranged from 29 to 64. The mothers were interviewed in depth, face-to-face, using unstructured, open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Results: The mothers described a range of issues of concern for their disabled offspring and themselves (as advocates) relating to health, social, educational, judicial systems, lack of knowledge by professionals and problems in diagnosis, to being oppressed and stigmatized. Cognitive concerns for the offspring included attention-deficit, absence of fear, diminished memory and comprehension and inability to acknowledge and understand consequences. Behavioural issues included excessive crying or no crying as a baby, lying, stealing, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, destructiveness, sexual promiscuity and few friends. Other issues of concern were delayed milestones and numerous health problems. All mothers stated that the pregnancy, labour and delivery of their child with FASD were different from their other non-compromised pregnancies/labours/deliveries. Most mothers said that the doctors used medical language which they did not understand, thus giving power to the former. Seven mothers were either married to or partners of alcoholics when they conceived their offspring with FASD. All mothers had been drinking alcohol before becoming pregnant. Six mothers came from drinking families. Most mothers continued to consume alcohol because they did not know that they had conceived. All mothers were unaware of FASD and its effects on the unborn child. Eight babies had low Apgar scores with an average of 6 (out of 10) and low birth weight (average 6lb 2oz). An Apgar score is a numerical expression of an infant's condition, usually determined at 60 seconds after birth, based on heart rate, respiratory efforts, muscle tone, reflex irritability and colour. All women were of middle to high socio-economic status. Seven mothers experienced family breakdown as a result of alcohol consumption by the biological father of the child with FASD. All women feared for their child's future. Conclusion: Health, social, educational, judicial professionals, policy-makers and agencies, need to understand and be educated in the daily realities and complex problems that children with FASD and their families face. Only then will the correct diagnosis be made so that these individuals can receive the nurturing, needs, education, funding and support they require in order to live full and meaningful lives and have the quality of life they deserve. ©2008 Canadian Society for Clinical Pharmacology.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - New draft alcohol guidelines for Australia state that, for pregnant women and women planning pregnancy, 'no drinking is the safest option'. One of the best known adverse effects of alcohol exposure on the fetus is the fetal alcohol syndrome. Others include alcohol-related birth defects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders and increased risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth and low birthweight. Over half of Australian women consume alcohol during pregnancy. Obstetricians have a pivotal role in advising women of the effects of alcohol on the fetus and reducing fetal exposure. © 2008 The Authors.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been identified as a major cause of impairment to normal physical and intellectual development among Indigenous children in Far North Queensland; however, little is known of the pregnancy characteristics of mothers of those children diagnosed with FAS or of interventions that might assist in lowering the prevalence of the syndrome. Aim: To review the pregnancy records of women whose infants were subsequently diagnosed with FAS by the Paediatric Outreach Service (POS) of the Cairns Base Hospital, and to determine how such women might be identified prospectively in pregnancy and offered intervention to reduce alcohol consumption. Methods: A retrospective case-control study involving all children diagnosed with FAS by the POS between 1994 and 2006; maternal pregnancy records were accessed and details obtained. Results: Mothers of cases were older, of higher parity, smoked more cigarettes, attended fewer antenatal visits and experienced more antenatal and delivery complications than mothers of controls. The average gestational age at booking was not statistically significant between the two groups. There was a significant difference between the two groups in self-reported alcohol consumption both before and during pregnancy and in numbers of women who decreased alcohol consumption once the diagnosis of pregnancy was known to them. Conclusions: There is the potential to identify prospectively women presenting for antenatal care who are heavy drinkers and risk FAS in their infants, using the self-reported information about alcohol intake already being collected by our service; such women may then be offered specific interventions to try to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnancy. © 2008 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), a severe consequence of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, is associated with craniofacial defects, mental retardation, and stunted growth. Previous studies in C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice provide evidence that alcohol-induced pathogenesis follows early changes in gene expression within specific molecular pathways in the embryonic headfold. Whereas the former (B6J) pregnancies carry a high-risk for dysmorphogenesis following maternal exposure to 2.9 g/kg alcohol (two injections spaced 4.0 h apart on gestation day 8), the latter (B6N) pregnancies carry a low-risk for malformations. The present study used this murine model to screen amniotic fluid for biomarkers that could potentially discriminate between FAS-positive and FAS-negative pregnancies. METHODS: B6J and B6N litters were treated with alcohol (exposed) or saline (control) on day 8 of gestation. Amniotic fluid aspirated on day 17 (n = 6 replicate litters per group) was subjected to trypsin digestion for analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry with the aid of denoising algorithms, statistical testing, and classification methods. RESULTS: We identified several peaks in the proteomics screen that were reduced consistently and specifically in exposed B6J litters. Preliminary characterization by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and multidimensional protein identification mapped the reduced peaks to alpha fetoprotein (AFP). The predictive strength of AFP deficiency as a biomarker for FAS-positive litters was confirmed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSIONS: These findings in genetically susceptible mice support clinical observations in maternal serum that implicate a decrease in AFP levels following prenatal alcohol damage. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is one of the most common preventable causes of developmental disability and is currently one of the most pressing public health concerns in Canada. FASD refers to the range of physical, mental, behavioural and learning disabilities that an individual may acquire as a result of maternal alcohol consumption. Prenatal exposure to alcohol leads to numerous primary and secondary disabilities in affected children, which can result in poot long-term outcomes. The present paper reviews previous research on the neurobehavioural outcomes of children with FASD, particularly in terms of behavioural, mental health and adaptive outcomes. The role of risk and protective factors on these outcomes and the impact of FASD on the family are also examined. Finally, future directions and implications regarding outcomes research among children with FASD, particularly within a Canadian context, are discussed. ©2008 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing kidneys
A1  - Assadi F.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Objective: Clinical and experimental studies strongly suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with zinc deficiency and impaired renal tubular function. Whether material alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes renal tubular cell injury is unknown. Material & Methods: Renal function was studied in 8 infants with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 8 healthy age-matched infants. Renal function and structure were also examined in 11 offspring of rats exposed to alcohol during gestation. Findings: Infants with FAS had limited ability to concentrate urine after water restriction (P<0.001) and impaired acidification after acute acid loading (P<0.001) compared to control group. Plasma zinc levels were lower (P<0.001) and urinary zinc excretion was higher (P<0.001) in infants with FAS compared to control infants. Scanning electron microscopic studies revealed cytoplasmic mitochondrial hypertrophy and vacuolar structures of the epithelial cells of the cortical collecting ducts in the rat kidney following fetal exposure to alcohol. Conclusion: These findings suggest that offspring of rats exposed to alcohol during fetal life have renal functional and structure abnormalities that may be responsible in the genesis of renal functional abnormalities as described in infacts with FAS.

N2  - Background: Although it is well known that France has a cultural history of alcohol use, no recent French data on alcohol consumption during pregnancy in a large sample are available. Methods: To determine the alcohol consumption patterns among pregnant women in France, we analyzed data from a 1-year multicenter self-survey. Sociodemographic profile, obstetrical history, neonatal data, and a self-report for assessing drinking patterns during pregnancy including AUDIT were recorded from women who delivered recently. Cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were also reported. Results: A total of 837 pregnant women have described all parameters. The mean age at delivery of our sample was 29.7 years (SD = 4.8 years). A total of 52.2% of women indicated that they had consumed alcohol at least once during their pregnancy, and among abstainers 54.5% had a positive AUDIT score. Of the pregnant women who consumed alcohol, 13.7% reported at least one binge drinking episode (5 or more drinks on 1 occasion) during pregnancy. Binge drinking is significantly more frequent than regular alcohol consumption (at least 1 drink more than 1 time per week) during pregnancy. A prevalence rate of FAS of 1.8 per 1,000 live births was observed. Conclusions: There is a large population of women who still drink alcohol during pregnancy, particularly in binge drinking episodes. This underlines the need to clearly inform women of childbearing age about the dangers of alcohol during pregnancy as related to all types of consumption. Moreover, acting to prevent alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy may also greatly influence prenatal drinking. Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objectives: This is a third exploration of risk factors for the two most severe forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and Partial FAS (PFAS), in a South African community with the highest reported prevalence of FAS in the world. Methods: In a case control design, interview and collateral data concerning mothers of 72 first grade children with FAS or PFAS are compared with 134 randomly selected maternal controls of children from the same schools. Results: Significant differences were found between the mothers of FASD children and controls in socio-economic status, educational attainment, and a higher prevalence of FASD among rural residents. The birth order of the index children, gravidity, and still birth were significantly higher among mothers of FASD children. Mothers of children with a FASD are less likely to be married and more likely to have a male partner who drank during the index pregnancy. Current and gestational alcohol use by mothers of FASD children is bingeing on weekends, with no reduction in drinking reported in any trimester in 75 to 90% of the pregnancies that resulted in an FAS child or during 50 to 87% of PFAS-producing pregnancies. There was significantly less drinking among the controls in the second and third trimesters (11 to 14%). Estimated peak blood alcohol concentrations (BAC)s of the mothers of PFAS children range from 0.155 in the first trimester to 0.102 in the third, and for mothers of FAS children the range is from 0.197 to 0.200 to 0.191 in the first, second, and third. Smoking percentage during pregnancy was significantly higher for mothers of FASD children (82 to 84%) than controls (35%); but average quantity smoked is low in the 3 groups at 30 to 41 cigarettes per week. A relatively young average age of the mother at the time of FAS and PFAS births (28.8 and 24.8 years respectively) is not explained by early onset of regular drinking (mean = 20.3 to 20.5 years of age). But the mean years of alcohol consumption is different between groups, 16.3, 10.7, and 12.1 years respectively for mothers of FAS, FASD, and drinking controls. Mothers of FAS and PFAS children were significantly smaller in height and weight than controls at time of interview. The child's total dysmorphology score correlates significantly with mother's weight (-0.46) and BMI (-0.39). Bivariate correlations are significant between the child's dysmorphology and known independent demographic and behavioral maternal risk factors for FASD: higher gravidity and parity; lower education and income; rural residence; drinks consumed daily, weekly, and bingeing during pregnancy; drinking in all trimesters; partner's alcohol consumption during pregnancy; and use of tobacco during pregnancy. Similar significant correlations were also found for most of the above independent maternal risk variables and the child's verbal IQ, non-verbal IQ and behavioral problems. Conclusions: Maternal data in this population are generally consistent with a spectrum of effects exhibited in the children. Variation within the spectrum links greater alcohol doses with a greater severity of effects among children of older and smaller mothers of lower socio economic status in their later pregnancies. Prevention is needed to address known maternal risk factors for FASD in this population. Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Determination of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair: A promising way for retrospective detection of alcohol abuse during pregnancy?

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The retrospective detection of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is an important part of the diagnosis of the fetal alcohol syndrome. A promising way to solve this problem can be the determination of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) or/and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair of the mothers. In this article, the present state in analytical determination and interpretation of FAEE and EtG concentrations in hair are reviewed. Both FAEE and EtG are minor metabolites of ethanol and as direct alcohol markers very specific for alcohol. They are durably deposited in hair, which enables taking advantage of the long diagnostic time window of this sample material. In the last years, specific and sensitive methods for determination of both alcohol markers in hair were developed. Headspace solid phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy after hair extraction with an n-heptane/dimethylsulfoxide mixture proved to be a favorable technique for determination of four characteristic FAEE (ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate). EtG is extracted from hair by water and analyzed either by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy with negative chemical ionization after cleanup with solid phase extraction and derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride or by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy. The detection limits of the single FAEE as well as of EtG are in the range of 1 to 10 pg/mg. FAEE as well as EtG were determined in a larger number of hair samples of teetotalers, social drinkers, patients in alcohol withdrawal treatment, and death cases with previous known heavy drinking. From the results, the following criteria were derived: strict abstinence is excluded or improbable at CFAEE >0.2 ng/mg or CEtG >7 pg/mg. Moderate social drinkers should have CFAEE <0.5 ng/mg and CEtG <25 pg/mg; above these values, alcohol abuse is probable. Until now, there has been no evaluation in context of FAS diagnosis; however, a successful application for this purpose can be expected from the good experience in driving ability examination. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Background: Although epidemiological data indicate that White women are more likely to drink and binge drink before pregnancy, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is more common in the Black population than among Whites in the United States. Differences in drinking cessation between Black and White women who become pregnant may help explain the disparity in FAS rates. Methods: The study sample was comprised of 280,126 non-Hispanic Black and White women, ages 18 to 44, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2001 to 2005 data sets. Predictors of reduction in alcohol consumption (in drinks per month) and binge drinking (>4 drinks on one occasion) by pregnant and non-pregnant women were identified with logistic regression. The effect of interactions of pregnancy status with age, education, and Black or White race on drinks per month and binge occasions were explored using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Pregnant White women averaged 79.5% fewer drinks per month than non-pregnant White women (F = 1250.1, p < 0.001), and 85.4% fewer binge drinking occasions (F = 376, p < 0.001). Pregnant Black women averaged 58.2% fewer drinks per month than non-pregnant Black women (F = 31.8, p < 0.001) and 64.0% fewer binge occasions (F = 13.8, p < 0.001). Compared to Black women, White women appear to make a 38% greater reduction in drinks per month, and a 33% greater reduction in binge occasions. Conclusions: Non-Hispanic White women appear more likely to reduce drinks per month and binge drinking occasions than non-Hispanic Black women during pregnancy. These findings may help explain disparities in FAS in the United States, though this cross-sectional sample does not permit claims of causation. To better describe the impact of differential drinking reduction on FAS rates, future studies of longitudinal data should be done. © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Brain structural abnormalities and neurocognitive dysfunction have been observed in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Little is known about how white matter integrity is related to these functional and morphological deficits. We used a combination of diffusion tensor and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate white matter integrity in individuals with FASDs and related these findings to neurocognitive deficits. Seventeen children and adolescents with FASDs were compared with 19 typically developing age-and gender-matched controls. Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) was observed in individuals with FASDs relative to controls in the right lateral temporal lobe and bilaterally in the lateral aspects of the splenium of the corpus callosum. White matter density was also lower in some, but not all regions in which FA was lower. FA abnormalities were confirmed to be in areas of white matter in post hoc region of interest analyses, further supporting that less myelin or disorganized fiber tracts are associated with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Significant correlations between performance on a test of visuomotor integration and FA in bilateral splenium, but not temporal regions were observed within the FASD group. Correlations between the visuomotor task and FA within the splenium were not significant within the control group, and were not significant for measures of reading ability. This suggests that this region of white matter is particularly susceptible to damage from prenatal alcohol exposure and that disruption of splenial fibers in this group is associated with poorer visuomotor integration.

N2  - Background: Ethanol (ETOH) consumption by pregnant women can result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). To date, the cellular targets and mechanisms responsible for FASD are not fully characterized. Our aim was to determine if ETOH can affect fetal human brain-derived neural progenitor cells (NPC). Methods: Neural progenitor cells were isolated by positive selection from normal second trimester fetal human brains (n = 4) and cultured, for up to 72 hours, in mitogenic media containing 0, 1, 10, or 100 mM ETOH. From 48 to 72 hours in culture, neurospheres generated in these conditions were filmed using time-lapse video microscopy. At the end of 72 hours, neurosphere diameter and roundness were measured using videographic software. Mitotic phase analysis of cell-cycle activity and apoptotic cell count were also performed at this time, by flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Real-time PCR was used to estimate expression of genes associated with cell adhesion pathways. Results: Neurosphere diameter correlated positively (r = 0.87) with increasing ETOH concentrations. There was no significant difference in cell-cycle activity and no significant increase in apoptosis with increasing ETOH concentrations. Time-lapse video microscopy showed that ETOH (100 mM) reduced the time for neurosphere coalescence. Real-time PCR analysis showed that ETOH significantly altered the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion. There was an increase in the expression of alpha and beta Laminins 1, beta Integrins 3 and 5, Secreted phosphoprotein1 and Sarcoglycan . No change in the expression of beta Actin was observed while the expression of beta Integrin 2 was significantly suppressed. Conclusions: ETOH had no effect on NPC apoptosis but, resulted in more rapid coalescence and increased volume of neurospheres. Additionally, the expression of genes associated with cell adhesion was significantly altered. ETOH induced changes in NPC surface adhesion interactions may underlie aspects of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in FASD. © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: A length polymorphism in the serotonin (5-HT) transporter gene promoter region in humans and rhesus monkeys affects functional characteristics of the brain 5-HT system. Prenatal alcohol exposure (FA-exposure) can have an impact on brain and psychosocial development that could interact with genetic endowment. This study determined whether moderate FA-exposure interacts with polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter gene to increase the incidence or severity of fetal alcohol effects in rhesus monkeys. Methods: The offspring of monkeys who did or did not consume moderate amounts of alcohol during pregnancy were assessed for temperament as neonates and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) in response to mother-infant separation at 6 months of age. Serotonin promoter region genotypes (homozygous s/s or heterozygous s/l versus homozygous l/l) were determined. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposed carriers of the s allele exhibited increased neonatal irritability and increased ACTH and CORT compared with FA-exposed monkeys homozygous for the l allele and monkeys that were not FA-exposed regardless of genotype. Conclusions: The s allele of the 5-HT transporter increases the probability of neonatal irritability and increased stress responsiveness in FA-exposed monkeys, and this gene-environment interaction may affect psychosocial development. It is probable that FA-exposure contributes to 5-HT transporter gene-environment interactions in humans. © 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

N2  - Children with either fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) display deficits in attention and executive function (EF) and differential diagnosis of these two clinical groups may be difficult, especially when information about prenatal alcohol exposure is unavailable. The current study compared EF performance of three groups: children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC); nonexposed children with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); and typically developing controls (CON). Both clinical groups met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The EF tasks used were the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Results indicated different patterns of deficit; both clinical groups displayed deficits on the WCST and a relative weakness on letter versus category fluency. Only the ALC group displayed overall deficits on letter fluency and a relative weakness on TMT-B versus TMT-A. In addition, WCST performance was significantly lower than expected based on IQ in the ADHD group and significantly higher than expected in the ALC group. These results, which indicate that, although EF deficits occurred in both clinical groups, the degree and pattern of deficit differed between the ALC and ADHD groups, may improve differential diagnosis. © 2008 The International Neuropsychological Society.

N2  - Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) have shown regional patterns of dysmorphology, most prominent in parietal and posterior temporal cortices. Various methods of image analysis have been employed in these studies, but abnormalities in cortical thickness have not yet been mapped over the entire cortical surface in individuals with FASD. Further, relationships between cognitive dysfunction and cortical thickness measures have not yet been explored. We applied cortical pattern matching algorithms and techniques for measuring cortical thickness in millimeters to the structural brain MRI images of 21 subjects with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (8-22 years, mean age 12.6 years), and 21 normally developing control subjects (8-25 years, mean age 13.5 years). Dissociable cognitive measures, of verbal recall and visuospatial functioning, were correlated with cortical thickness, and group by test score interactions were evaluated for predicting cortical thickness. Significant cortical thickness excesses of up to 1.2 mm were observed in the FASD subjects in large areas of bilateral temporal, bilateral inferior parietal, and right frontal regions. Significant group by test score interactions were found in right dorsal frontal regions for the verbal recall measure and in left occipital regions for the visuospatial measure. These results are consistent with earlier analyses from our own and other research groups, but for the first time, we show that cortical thickness is also increased in right lateral frontal regions in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Further, the significant interactions show for the first time that brain-behavior relationships are altered as a function of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. © The Author 2007.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) occurs in approximately 3 of 1,000 live births in the general population of the U.S. and is the leading known cause of mental retardation. The Midwest Regional Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Training Center (MRFASTC) surveyed 1,000 licensed occupational therapists (OT) of the American Occupational Therapists Association in a six-state Midwest region, including Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding FAS. Nearly 20% of the OTs responded. Of the respondents, nearly 94% regarded at least 1 drink per day as being 'heavy' in a pregnant woman. There was an increase in the number of respondents who thought it was acceptable to consume 1 drink or more with each advancing trimester of pregnancy. 92% of the OTs indicated a willingness to counsel a mother of a child having FAS, but 96% indicated a poor to fair ability to select valid and reliable assessment instruments for screening a child for FAS. Only 6% of the OT respondents indicated a good-excellent ability to conduct brief interventions on alcohol cessation for women. The data collectively indicate OTs possess similarities to other health care providers, including physicians and psychologists, in the misunderstanding or deficits of knowledge and skills associated with FAS and that they are largely unprepared to provide intervention for women 'at risk' for FAS, or to recognize correctly FAS in children. There is a demonstrated need, and desire, by the practicing OTs for continued education related to alcohol abuse associated with FAS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a preventable cause of developmental delay and growth failure. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the clinical features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the role of the general practitioner in prevention and management. DISCUSSION: Early diagnosis of and intervention for problems associated with FAS reduce adverse long term outcomes. Most health professionals have limited knowledge of FASD and lack confidence in the diagnosis and management of children with FASD. General practitioners have an important role in identifying women and children at risk of harm from alcohol and arranging referral for assessment and management when necessary. Educational materials for health professionals are currently under development.

T1  - Appraisal of neurobehavioral methods in environmental health research: The developing brain as a target for neurotoxic chemicals
A1  - Winneke G.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Psychological tests as developed and validated in the field of differential psychology have a longstanding tradition as tools to study individual differences. In clinical neuropsychology, global or more specific tests are used as neuropsychological tools in the differential diagnosis of various forms of brain damage or neurobehavioral dysfunction following chemical insults, such as mental sequelae of prenatal alcohol consumption by pregnant mothers (fetal alcohol syndrome) or of maternal thyroid deficiency during pregnancy. Psychometric tests are constructed to fulfill basic quality criteria, namely objectivity, reliability and validity. For strictly diagnostic purposes in individual cases they must also possess normative values based on representative reference groups. Intelligence tests or their developmental variants are often used as endpoints in environmental health research for studying neurodevelopmental adversity due to early exposure to neurotoxic chemicals in the environment. Intelligence as treated in psychology is a complex construct made up of specific cognitive functions which usually cover verbal, numerical and spatial skills, as well as perceptual speed, memory and reasoning. In this paper, case studies covering neurodevelopmental adversity of inorganic lead, of methylmercury and of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are reviewed, and the issue of postnatal behavioral sequelae of prenatal exposure is covered. In such observational studies precautions must be taken in order to avoid pitfalls of causative interpretation of associations between exposure and neurobehavioral outcome. This requires consideration of co-exposure and confounding. Important confounders considered in most modern developmental cohort studies are maternal intelligence and quality of the home environment. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Purpose: This article is a retrospective examination of environmental risk, language performance, and narrative discourse data from a clinical database of school-age children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Method: A case-defined diagnostic approach for measuring and reporting the full spectrum of disabilities in children with prenatal alcohol exposure is presented. Demographic, environmental, language, and social communication (as reflected by narrative discourse) data are reported for a large cohort of children with FASD between the ages of 6;0 (years;months) and 12;0. Results: Children with FASD are a heterogeneous group with varying levels of compromise. The data demonstrate a substantial comorbidity between the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and adverse caregiving environments. The data further reveal that school-age children with FASD often exhibit clinically meaningful deficits in language and social communication. Clinical Implication: Children with FASD may be particularly vulnerable to language and social communication deficits as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure and atypical or adverse social interactive experiences. Comprehensive assessment is recommended. Dynamic and functional assessment paradigms may document the language and social communicative deficits in children with FASD and other clinical populations with complex neurodevelopmental profiles. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Understanding the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and supporting students
A1  - Green J.H.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) affect a significant number of children in this country. This article addresses diagnostic issues related to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other alcohol-related disabilities, discusses associated features and behaviors of FASD, and introduces interventions to support children with FASD in school settings. Methods: A comprehensive review of FAS and FASD literature as it relates to school functioning was conducted. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a broad range of negative developmental consequences, including deficits in cognitive and academic functioning, psychological disorders, behavioral problems, and difficulties with independent living. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure are at risk for a spectrum of difficulties at school. Conclusions: This topic is of considerable relevance to all professionals in a school setting, including teachers, administrators, school psychologists, special education providers, special service providers, and school nurses who interact with children who may be prenatally exposed to alcohol. Successful interventions will need to balance the use of environmental modifications, immediate and meaningful positive and negative consequences for behaviors, and opportunities to teach children skills to monitor and modify their behavior. © 2007, American School Health Association.

T1  - Neurocognitive and neurobehavioral impairments in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Recognition and assessment
A1  - Paley B.
A1  - O'Connor M.J.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) represent a continuum of development disabilities associated with maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. This spectrum of disorders, which includes the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), is characterized by a wide range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. Estimates of the number of live births in the United States meeting criteria for a diagnosis of FAS range from .5 to 2 infants per 1,000, with the prevalence of the entire continuum of FASDs estimated to be 1 in 100. This paper discusses some of the complexities involved in diagnosing individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, provides a review of the neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits commonly seen in this population, and examines how such deficits may manifest during different developmental periods across the life span. Additionally, strategies for assessing these deficits are described, and specific measures that are appropriate for alcohol-exposed individuals are presented. The challenges of working with this under-identified and underserved population are highlighted, as well as the importance of early diagnosis and intervention.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in life-long primary and secondary disabilities in affected individuals. Adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and/or prenatal alcohol exposure display high rates of many risky behaviors. In this paper, we review the risky behaviors common in adolescents with FASD, including trouble with the law, delinquency, substance abuse, disrupted school experience and dropping out of school, inappropriate sexual behavior, suicidality, psychopathology, and maladaptive behavior. Next, we review factors that are related to high risk behaviors in individuals with FASD, which include executive functioning deficits, impaired decision making, and abnormalities of the prefrontal cortex. Finally, we discuss why adolescence is a period of increased risk taking and poor decision making, and how individuals with FASD are particularly vulnerable during adolescence.

N2  - Objective: To discuss relevant issues in the diagnosis of mental disorders comorbid with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: We present a theoretical model of the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurobehavioral development and a systematic review of published data on the mental disorders in subjects with an FASD. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with high rates of mental disorders. We found 48 papers reporting on 3,343 subjects. The most common mental disorder comorbid with FASD is attention deficit - hyperactivity disorder occurring in 48% of subjects with FASD. Cognitive impairment is also very common. Discussion: Prenatal alcohol exposure appears to have differential effects on outcomes leading to large increases in rates of some but apparently not most mental disorders. We discuss strategies to improve the diagnosis of mental disorders in FASD and the multiplicity of uses for this important data. Copyright © Freund Publishing House Limited.

N2  - Aims: The prenatal ethanol exposure induced neuroapoptosis and neuron loss in visual cortex would be investigated in mice at P0, P7 and P14. Methods: Intubating pregnant mice ethanol daily began on E5 and continued through the pup's birth. The neuroapoptosis in visual cortex was visualized by the caspase 3 immunocytochemistry, and the neuron loss was observed with Nissl method as well. Results: With prenatal ethanol exposure, the dose-dependent neuroapoptosis and neuron loss in visual cortex could be found at P0 and even at P7 and P14 as well. Conclusions: The prenatal ethanol exposure induced neuroapoptosis and neuron loss will persist into postnatal stage, and the long-term effect of neuroapoptosis might be one of the causes of postnatal neurobehavioural disturbances associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. © The Author 2007.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is defined as a permanent birth defect syndrome caused by maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. It is characterized by growth deficiency, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and minor facial anomalies. The incidence in the USA has been estimated to be between 0.33 and 2.2 per 1000 live births. Until the 90's, there were no objective, standardized criteria for the diagnosis of FAS. We report the case of a boy aged 5 years and 10 months who has been diagnosed as having this syndrome. The aim of this article is to review and update the criteria for the diagnosis of FAS.

N2  - The effect of 'binge' alcohol upon sphingolipid metabolism in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was examined in pregnant mice (C57BL/6J) by administering a single dose of alcohol during the third trimester (gestational day 15-16). The control mice were administered a sucrose solution of equal caloric value. Brains from progeny at postnatal days 5, 15, 21 and 30 were dissected into three regions, and sphingolipid concentrations of the brain regions were determined including assay of monoglycosylceramide, ceramide, sphingosine and sphingomyelin. We found that a single dose of ethanol induces an elevation of sphingosine (2-3.5-fold) in the brain of progeny. The level of brain ceramide at a dose of 1.5 g/kg was significantly higher than control. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy induces neuronal loss in progeny brains. Our result suggests that the elevation of sphingosine in progeny brain induced by maternal alcohol consumption may be responsible for observed neuronal loss in FAS. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Alcohol is the most common teratogen in humans. Excessive alcohol consumption in pregnant women may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, facial dysmorphology, and abnormalities in the central nervous system. Despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanisms underlying FAS remain unclear. To this end, we established a Xenopus laevis embryo model to study the effects of alcohol on fetal development. We will discuss the relationship between alcohol-induced oxidative and nitrosative stresses and their differential and critical roles in the downregulation of key developmental genes and birth defects in the X. laevis embryo model.

T1  - Effect of gestational ethanol exposure on long-term memory formation in newborn chicks
A1  - Rao V.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized by craniofacial malformations, and physical and mental retardation. It is significant that even children with history of gestational ethanol exposure but relatively unaffected overall IQ performance, often exhibit learning difficulties and behavioral problems, suggestive of impaired memory formation. Hence, the specific aim of this study was to examine memory formation in chicks exposed to ethanol during early gestation toward the understanding of neurobehavioral disturbances in FAS. Chicks were exposed to alcohol on gestational days 1-3 by injection of ethanol into the airspace of freshly fertilized eggs. The effects of prenatal ethanol on physical growth and development, and memory formation were studied. The one-trial passive avoidance learning paradigm in 1-day-old chicks was used to study memory formation in these chicks. It was observed that chick embryos exposed to 10% ethanol on gestational days 1-3 had significant reduction in all body parameters when compared with appropriate controls. Further, ethanol-exposed chick embryos had significantly impaired (P < .05) long-term memory (LTM) formation after training, though short-term or intermediate-term memory formation was unimpaired. Thus, the findings of the current study demonstrate the detrimental effects of ethanol exposure during early pregnancy on developing chick embryos in general and on memory formation in particular. Hence, it is suggested that impairment in LTM could be a fundamental mechanism for learning disorders and neurobehavioral abnormalities observed in FAS. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Unintentional injuries are a leading cause of death and disability for children. Those with developmental disabilities, including children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, are at highest risk for injuries. Although teaching safety skills is recommended to prevent injury, cognitive limitations and behavioral problems characteristic of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder make teaching these skills challenging for parents and teachers. In the current study, 32 children, ages 4-10, diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS, learned fire and street safety through computer games that employed "virtual worlds" to teach recommended safety skills. Children were pretested on verbal knowledge of four safety elements for both fire and street safety conditions and then randomly assigned to one condition. After playing the game until mastery, children were retested verbally and asked to "generalize" their newly acquired skills in a behavioral context. They were retested after 1 week follow-up. Children showed significantly better knowledge of the game to which they were exposed, immediately and at follow-up, and the majority (72%) was able to generalize all four steps within a behavioral setting. Results suggested that this is a highly effective method for teaching safety skills to high-risk children who have learning difficulties. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES. Our goals were to determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with an increased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in infancy and to compare effects of fetal alcohol exposure and iron-deficiency anemia on infant growth. We also tested whether effects of fetal alcohol exposure on growth are mediated or moderated by iron-deficiency anemia. METHODS. A total of 96 infants born to mothers from the Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, were recruited prenatally; 42 mothers drank heavily during pregnancy, and 54 abstained or drank small amounts of alcohol. Growth was assessed at birth and 6.5 and 12 months, and iron-deficiency anemia was assessed at 6.5 or 12 months. RESULTS. Infants whose mothers binge drank during pregnancy (>4 drinks per occasion) were 3.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia at 12 months than were infants whose mothers did not binge drink. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with reduced weight at birth, 6.5 months, and 12 months and with shorter length at 6.5 and 12 months. Iron-deficiency anemia was related to reduced 12-month weight and head circumference and to slower growth velocity between 6 and 12 months. The effects of prenatal alcohol on weight were not mediated by iron-deficiency anemia; however, they were seen primarily in infants with iron-deficiency anemia. CONCLUSIONS. The association of maternal binge drinking with an increased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia may reflect disruption of accumulation of fetal iron stores or postnatal deficiencies in iron uptake, absorption, or intake. Moreover, iron deficiency seems to exacerbate the prenatal alcohol effects on growth. Copyright © 2007 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - Cerebral hypoxia has been proposed as a mechanism by which prenatal ethanol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in children, but no study had tested this hypothesis using a chronic exposure model that mimicks a common human exposure pattern. Pregnant sheep were exposed to ethanol, 0.75 or 1.75 g kg-1 (to create blood ethanol concentrations of 85 and 185 mg dl-1, respectively), or saline 3 days per week in succession (a 'binge drinking' model) from gestational day (GD) 109 until GD 132. Fetuses were instrumented on GD 119-120 and studied on GD 132. The 1.75 g kg-1 dose resulted in a significant increase in fetal biventricular output (measured by radiolabelled microsphere technique) and heart rate, and a reduction of mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance at 1 h, the end of ethanol infusion. The arterial partial pressure of CO2 was increased, arterial pH was decreased and arterial partial pressure of O2 did not change. Fetal whole-brain blood flow increased by 37% compared with the control group at 1 h, resulting in increased cerebral oxygen delivery. The elevation in brain blood flow was region specific, occurring preferentially in the ethanol-sensitive cerebellum, increasing by 44% compared with the control group at 1 h. There were no changes in the lower dose group. Assessment of regional differences in the teratogenic effects of ethanol by stereological cell-counting technique showed a reduced number of cerebellar Purkinje cells in response to the 1.75 g kg-1 dose compared with the control brains. However, no such differences in neuronal numbers were observed in the hippocampus or the olfactory bulb. We conclude that repeated exposure to moderate doses of ethanol during the third trimester alters fetal cerebral vascular function and increases blood flow in brain regions that are vulnerable to ethanol in the presence of acidaemia and hypercapnia, and in the absence of hypoxia. © 2007 The Authors.

N2  - Objective. Review of the prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHD) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Design. We conducted a search of the Medline and Pubmed databases to identify papers reporting the association. We then searched the reference lists of the papers and reference books for additional sources. Results. We found 29 studies that met our inclusion criteria. In the 12 case series studies of subjects with FASD, the proportion of cases with a CHD (atrial [ASD] and ventricular [VSD] septal defects, other defects, or unspecified CHD) ranged from 33% to 100%. From the 14 retrospective studies, the rate of septal defects was 21%, other structural defects 6% and unspecified defects was 12%. For the 2 case-control studies, the odds of CHD ranged from 1.0 (subjects with fetal alcohol effect) to 18.0 (subjects with fetal alcohol syndrome). In the 1 prospective study of CHD the OR for a child to have CHD and FASD was 1.0. Key Conclusion. Pediatric cardiologists may have frequent contact with children with FASD and increased levels of attention to prenatal alcohol exposure as a potential etiology of CHD is indicated. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing, Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to widespread cognitive impairment and behavioral dysregulation, including deficits in attention and response inhibition. This study characterized the neural substrates underlying the disinhibited behavioral profile of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Children and adolescents (ages 8-18) with (n=13) and without (n=9) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a response inhibition (go/no-go) task. Results: Despite similar task performance (mean response latency, performance accuracy, and signal detection), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response patterns differed by group. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that during portions of the behavioral task that required response inhibition, alcohol-exposed participants showed greater BOLD response across prefrontal cortical regions (including the left medial and right middle frontal gyri), while they showed less right caudate nucleus activation, compared with control participants. Conclusions: These data provide an account of response inhibition-related brain functioning in youth with FASD. Furthermore, results suggest that the frontal-striatal circuitry thought to mediate inhibitory control is sensitive to alcohol teratogenesis. Copyright © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Methods: A socio-cognitive habilitative program focused on improving behavior and math functioning in children 3 to 10 years of age (n=61) was developed and evaluated. The intervention provided parental instruction on FAS, advocacy, and behavioral regulation via workshops and interactive math tutoring with children. All families received parental instruction and were then randomly assigned to either the math instruction or standard psychoeducational care groups. Results: Satisfaction with workshops was very high, with over 90% agreeing that trainers were knowledgeable and materials easy to understand and helpful. Significant gains in knowledge were found for information provided in the instructional groups. At posttesting, caregivers reported fewer problem behaviors on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, Internalizing Problem Behavior, Externalizing Problem Behavior, and Total Problem Behavior summary scales. After 5 months, both groups of children demonstrated gains in math knowledge but significantly higher gains were found in the group receiving direct math instruction. The math treatment group was also more likely to demonstrate a gain of over 1 standard deviation on any of the 4 math outcome measures used. Conclusions: These findings suggest that parents of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FAS(D)) benefit from instruction in understanding their child's alcohol-related neurological damage and strategies to provide positive behavioral supports and that targeted psychoeducational programs may be able to remediate some of the math deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a severe outcome of alcohol use during pregnancy, and the rates may be higher in countries with greater use of alcohol. To obtain information from Russian physicians (N = 23), women (N = 23), and male partners (N = 5), focus groups were conducted with 51 participants in St. Petersburg, Russia. The main objective was to determine the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior related to drinking during pregnancy. Data were analyzed using ATLAS-ti 5.0. The results will be used to develop a survey of Russian professionals and women leading to FAS prevention programming. The study's limitations are described. Copyright © 2007 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - The subject of this literature review is the fetal alcohol syndrome (F.A.S.). It will describe the effects that the ingestion of large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy, have upon the developing fetus from a physiological perspective. Alcohol is a potent teratogen in humans, and prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The physiological problems encountered by the neonate, who has been exposed to high levels of in utero alcohol, necessitating admission to the neonatal unit, will be addressed. As the neonatal unit delivers a holistic approach to care this review will also describe the psychological and sociological effects of F.A.S. on the newborn infants and their families. It will also aim to discuss how these factors influence the planning and management of care delivered to the neonate who has F.A.S., whilst being nursed on the neonatal unit. ©Pharmakon-Press.

N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can produce an array of birth defects comprising fetal alcohol syndrome. A hallmark of fetal alcohol syndrome is intrauterine growth retardation, which is associated with elevated apoptosis of placental cytotrophoblast cells. Using a human first trimester cytotrophoblast cell line, we examined the relationship between exposure to ethanol and cytotrophoblast survival, as well as the ameliorating effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors produced by human cytotrophoblast cells. After exposure to 0-100 mM ethanol, cell death was quantified by the TUNEL method, and expression of the nuclear proliferation marker, Ki67, was measured by immunohistochemistry. The mode of cell death was determined by assessing annexin V binding, caspase 3 activation, pyknotic nuclear morphology, reduction of TUNEL by caspase inhibition, and cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase. Ethanol significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death approximately 2.5-fold through the apoptotic pathway within 1-2 h of exposure to 50 mM alcohol. Exposure to 25-50 mM ethanol significantly increased transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF), but not EGF or amphiregulin (AREG). When cytotrophoblasts were exposed concurrently to 100 mM ethanol and 1 nM HBEGF or TGFA, the increase in apoptosis was prevented, while EGF ameliorated at 10 nM and AREG was weakly effective. HBEGF survival-promoting activity required ligation of either of its cognate receptors, HER1 or HER4. These findings reveal the potential for ethanol to rapidly induce cytotrophoblast apoptosis. However, survival factor induction could provide cytotrophoblasts with an endogenous cytoprotective mechanism. © 2007 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure may adversely affect fetal development, causing growth restriction, distinctive craniofacial anomalies, and central nervous system dysfunction. The continuum of associated adverse fetal outcomes is most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The purpose of this study was to further clarify the relationship between dysmorphic features and general cognitive capacity in a study on Finnish children with FASD. Forty-eight 8- to 16-year-old children with FASD underwent a dysmorphology examination and an assessment of cognitive capacity. Dysmorphic features and growth deficiency were quantified by assigning each child a total dysmorphology score (TDS). Six subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) were used for assessment of general cognitive capacity. Our results show a significant correlation between the TDS and cognitive capacity was found, suggesting that children with more severe growth deficiency and dysmorphic features have more cognitive limitations. Birth measures of length and weight correlated with general cognitive capacity. Head circumference correlated only with Performance IQ. These findings imply an inverse relationship between growth deficiency/dysmorphic features and cognitive function in children with FASD. Although the correlations are significant, the data suggest that in individual cases, the TDS cannot reliably predict cognitive function in later life. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Alcohol use during pregnancy can result in a continuum of effects including growth deficits, dysmorphology and/or complex patterns of behavioural and cognitive difficulties that influence an individual's functioning throughout their lifespan. We conducted a systematic review to identify research-based interventions for children and youth with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and areas for future study. Methods: We identified the substantive literature by searching 40 peer-reviewed and 23 grey literature databases, as well as reference lists. We hand-searched eight relevant journals, and undertook a systematic search of Internet sites and review of reports and documents received from key stakeholders. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Given the small number of studies that met all inclusion criteria, both experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included. Results: Ten intervention studies were identified, of which three were experimental or quasi-experimental, and four were non-experimental. Despite multiple attempts, three studies (two in foreign languages and one unpublished) could not be acquired. A meta-analysis could not be undertaken because the included studies examined different interventions or outcomes. Interventions targeted in the included studies were as follows: (i) psychostimulant medications (methyphenidate, pemoline and dextroamphetamine); and (ii) Cognitive Control Therapy. The identified studies were limited by very small sample sizes and weak designs. Conclusion: There is limited scientific evidence upon which to draw recommendations regarding efficacious interventions for children and youth with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Clinicians, researchers, service providers, educators, policy makers, affected children and youth and their families, and others need to urgently collaborate to develop a comprehensive research agenda for this population. © 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - * It is well accepted that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, but research findings for exposure to low to moderate alcohol levels during pregnancy are equivocal, allowing a range of interpretations. * The 2001 guideline from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for low-risk drinking for "women who are pregnant or might soon become pregnant" recommends fewer than seven standard drinks per week, and no more than two standard drinks on any one day. This position has polarised health professional and consumer opinion in Australia. * The NHMRC guidelines on alcohol are scheduled for review in 2007. We surveyed the alcohol and pregnancy policies and clinical practice guidelines of Australia and six other English-speaking countries to identify current policy. Documents were obtained through Internet searches and direct contact with the relevant organisations. * The policies and guidelines varied both across and within countries, and the NHMRC guideline, while not universally supported in Australia, is in step with the policies of the United Kingdom and Canada. * Research is needed to elucidate the true association between low to moderate alcohol consumption and fetal harm, the impact of different policies on rates of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and any untoward outcomes of an abstinence message, to inform and underpin future policy development in Australia.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Alcohol abuse produces damaging effects on the CNS that leads to several types of disorders. When consumed during pregnancy, alcohol may cause craniofacial malformations, growth retardation and brain damage in offspring. These symptoms are grouped by the term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is the most common cause of non-genetic mental retardation in the western world. Substantial efforts to elucidate the molecular basis of these impairments are currently in progress. Whereas FAS is totally preventable by avoiding alcohol intake during pregnancy, efficient therapies to prevent or mitigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are still not available but many pharmacological treatments have been developed to avoid alcohol intake and dependence in adults. The present article reviews the most relevant mechanisms of alcohol injury in developing brain and the strategies and patents that are currently available and in progress to prevent therapy for FAS. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

There is thus a need for laboratory markers for early detection of alcohol-exposed neonates. The aim of our study was to assess the efficiency of the usual alcohol biomarkers measured in cord blood to identify alcohol-exposed neonates immediately after birth. Methods: A 1-year study was conducted in the labor wards of the maternity units of the Auvergne, Central France at the time of term delivery. The patients answered an anonymous self-completion survey concerning alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test; AUDIT) during their pregnancy. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and -glutamyltransferase concentrations and the percentage of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were measured in maternal and cord blood. Results: We collected 870 maternal-fetal sample pairs. Two cases (0.2%) of typical FASD were detected. We report a non-significant correlation between maternal and cord blood biomarkers. None of the cord blood biomarkers differed significantly between newborns of alcohol-exposed and unexposed mothers. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the usual alcohol biomarkers are not effective in cord blood for identifying alcohol-exposed neonates. ©2007 by Walter de Gruyter.

N2  - Objectives: The prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) were determined in a third primary school cohort in a community in South Africa (SA). Methods: An active case ascertainment, two-tier screening methodology, and the revised Institute of Medicine diagnostic criteria were employed among 818 first grade pupils. Characteristics of children with FAS and PFAS are contrasted with a randomly selected control group. Data were collected and analyzed for children in the study regarding: (1) physical growth and development, including dysmorphology, (2) intelligence and behavioral characteristics, and (3) their mother's social, behavioral, and physical characteristics. Results: The rate of FAS and PFAS in this area continues as the highest reported in any overall community and is much higher than rates elsewhere. In this cohort it is 68.0-89.2 per 1000. Severe episodic drinking on weekends among mothers of children with FAS and PFAS accounts for 96% of all alcohol consumed. Various measures of maternal drinking are significantly correlated with negative outcomes of children in the areas of non-verbal intelligence (-0.26), verbal intelligence (-0.28), problem behavior (0.31), and overall dysmorphology score (0.59). Significantly more FAS and PFAS exists among children of rural residents (OR = 3.79). Conclusions: A high rate of FAS and PFAS was again documented in this community, and it has increased. Given population similarities, we suspect that other communities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa also have high rates. Programs for prevention are needed. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. This study compared the prevalence of psychopathological conditions in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (N = 39) and nonexposed, typically developing peers (N = 30), matched with respect to age, gender, and socioeconomic status. METHODS. Caregivers were interviewed with either the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime Version, or the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version IV. Statistical resampling methods were used to create 95% confidence intervals for the difference between the proportions of children with psychopathological conditions in the exposed and control groups. RESULTS. Group differences were seen in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depressive disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and specific phobia outcome categories. The group difference in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder category was by far the largest effect observed. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that fetal alcohol exposure should be considered a possible factor in the pathogenesis of childhood psychiatric disorders. These data provide clinically relevant information about the mental health problems that children with fetal alcohol exposure are likely to face.

N2  - Objective: To establish the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in Victoria through the Victorian Birth Defects Register (VBDR). Methods: A sample of live births from 1995-2002 was selected from the Victorian Perinatal Data Collection and VBDR based on reported microcephaly, FAS or maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy. Following ethics approval, medical records of mother and child were requested for 117 births. One hundred and nine of these were accessed and examined for factors related to FAS. Records were categorised as FAS, possible FAS, unable to categorise, or not FAS. Results: From the VBDR the prevalence was calculated at 0.006 per 1,000 live births. Four additional possible cases of FAS increased this to 0.014 per 1,000 live births. Six cases were defined as 'unable to categorise'as alcohol use was unknown but other features of FAS were evident. Including these cases, plus five where some low-level alcohol use was reported, increased the prevalence to 0.03 per 1,000 live births. Twenty-eight per cent of the audit population and 39% of the microcephalic cases had no information about maternal alcohol use recorded in the antenatal or babies'records. Conclusion and Implications: The audit of medical records provided additional information regarding FAS prevalence in Victoria. This prevalence ranges from 0.01 to 0.03 per 1,000 live births. To accurately assess the extent of the problem, there needs to be improved reporting of alcohol use in pregnancy and a system in place to report cases diagnosed during and beyond the perinatal period to the VBDR.

N2  - Alcohol is detrimental to the developing brain and remains the leading cause of mental retardation in developed countries. The mechanism of alcohol brain damage remains elusive. Studies of neurological problems in adults have focused on alcohol's cerebrovascular effects, because alcoholism is a major risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular injuries. However, few studies have examined similar cerebrovascular effects of fetal alcohol exposure. We examined the effect of chronic binge alcohol exposure during the second trimester on fetal cerebrovascular and metabolic responses to hypoxia in near-term sheep and tested the hypothesis that fetal alcohol exposure would attenuate cerebrovascular dilation to hypoxia. Pregnant ewes were infused with alcohol (1.5 g/kg) or saline intravenously at 60-90 days of gestation (full term = 150 days). At 125 days of gestation, we measured fetal cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism at baseline and during hypoxia. Maternal blood alcohol averaged 214 +/- 5.9 mg/dl immediately after the 1.5-h infusion, with similar values throughout the month of infusion. Hypoxia resulted in a robust increase in CBF in saline-infused fetuses. However, the CBF response to hypoxia in fetuses chronically exposed to alcohol was significantly attenuated. Cerebral oxygen delivery decreased in both groups of fetuses during hypoxia but to a greater degree in the alcohol-exposed fetuses. Prenatal alcohol exposure during the second trimester attenuates cerebrovascular responses to hypoxia in the third trimester. Altered cerebrovascular reactivity might be one mechanism for alcohol-related brain damage and might set the stage for further brain injury if a hypoxic insult occurs.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects 1 in 100 births in the United States and results in craniofacial dysmorphologic condition and learning disabilities. In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroprotective peptides prevented fetal death and learning deficits. The -aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor subunit GABAbeta3 plays a critical role for nervous system and palate development. Our objective was to determine whether the neuropeptides prevented alcohol-induced damage through GABAbeta3. Study design: With a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, timed pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol) or control (saline solution) or alcohol plus peptides NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (NAP + SAL; 20 mug). Embryos were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days after treatment. Adult males were tested for learning on the Morris water maze, and their brains were dissected. With samples from at least 3 litters per time point, calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for GABAbeta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher protected least significant difference. Results: Twenty-four hours and 10 days after treatment, alcohol decreased GABAbeta3 in the embryos (P < .01); this decrease was prevented by the peptides (P = .01). GABAbeta3 was higher in alcohol treated adult brains respect to the controls (P = .002); this rise was not prevented by the peptides. Conclusion: Treatment with the neuropeptides NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA prevented the alcohol-induced decline in GABAbeta3 expression 10 days after alcohol exposure. Because palate formation continues through E18, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA may be beneficial for the prevention of cleft lip and palate. © 2007 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most devastating. Recognized by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities and growth deficiency, this condition produces severe alcohol-induced damage in the developing brain. FAS children experience ataxia; deficits in intellectual functioning; and difficulties in learning, memory, problem solving, and attention. Multiple aspects of central nervous system development can be affected by alcohol exposure, but the most striking abnormalities are neuronal and glial migration. Little is known about cellular mechanisms by which alcohol affects the migration of immature neurons. Recently, it has been found that Ca2+ signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of the action of alcohol in neuronal cell migration. Most importantly, the aberrant migration of immature neurons caused by alcohol exposure is significantly ameliorated by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways. In this Mini-Review, we first describe how alcohol exposure impairs the migration of cerebellar granule cells and then discuss the signaling mechanisms involved. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in a spectrum of adverse developmental outcomes in offspring, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Deficits in executive function - the psychological processes involved in controlling voluntary goal-oriented behavior - are prevalent in FASD. Oculomotor tasks have been designed as highly sensitive tools to evaluate components of executive function. Because of the extensive overlap in the brain areas controlling eye movements and those affected in FASD, we hypothesized that individuals with FASD display specific neurobehavioral abnormalities that can be quantified with eye movement testing. Methods: Subjects (8-12 years old) were instructed to look either toward (prosaccade) or away from (antisaccade) a stimulus that appeared in the peripheral visual field. Two fixation conditions were used. In the gap condition, the central fixation point (FP) was removed before the appearance of the peripheral stimulus; in the overlap condition, the FP remained illuminated. Saccadic reaction times (SRTs, time from stimulus appearance to saccade initiation), direction errors (saccades made in the incorrect direction relative to instruction), and express saccades (short-latency: SRT=90-140 ms) were measured to assess automatic and volitional saccade control. Results: Compared with controls, FASD children had elongated reaction times, excessive direction errors, and no express saccades. Metric analysis of correct prosaccades revealed a trend toward increased saccadic duration and decreased saccadic velocity in FASD subjects. Conclusion: These results reflect deficits in executive function and motor control, and are consistent with dysfunction of the frontal lobes, possibly due to disrupted inhibitory mechanisms. Therefore, eye movement tasks may be powerful and easy tools for assessing executive function deficits in FASD. Copyright © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - In Italy, little is known about the spectrum of adverse fetal effects related to maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. In this paper, we report on the phenotype of Italian children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These data were gathered as part of a field study assessing the prevalence of FASD in children in an in-school study in a rural area near Rome. The purposes of this paper are: (1) to completely characterize the clinical phenotype of a large cohort of Italian children with FASD; (2) to correlate and contrast the phenotype of this population with that observed in other populations and reported in the medical literature; (3) to discuss the drinking habits of Italian women, before, during and after pregnancy; and (4) to suggest mechanisms for intervention and prevention of FASD based on data gathered from this study. © 2006.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure causes permanent structural alterations to the brain and can lead to numerous cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Consistent with many of the neuropsychological and behavioral deficits that have been reported, neuroimaging studies reveal a pattern of structural abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This chapter systematically reviews structural anomalies by brain region, identifying cognitive and behavioral correlates when relevant. The consensus shows that in addition to the overall reduction of brain size, prominent brain shape abnormalities have been observed, with narrowing in the parietal region and reduced brain growth in portions of the frontal lobe. Commensurating with these anomalies, volumetric and tissue density findings cite disproportionate reductions in the parietal lobe, cerebellar vermis, corpus callosum, and the caudate nucleus, suggesting that certain areas of the brain may be especially vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure. In sum, neuroimaging techniques have greatly advanced our understanding of brain-behavior relationships in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and hopefully will lead to improved diagnosis and treatment options for those affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the most severe manifestation of the adverse effects of alcohol on foetal development, was first described in the French medical literature by Lemoine et al. in 1968 [Les Gfants des parents alcholiques: anomalies observes a propos de 127 cas (The children of alchoholic parents: anomalies observed in 127 cases). Quert in Medicine 8, 476-482]. Five years later, Jones et al., 1973. Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic alcholic mothers. Lancet 1, 1129-1267] were the first to delineate systematically the association between maternal alcohol abuse and a specific pattern of birth defects and to provide diagnostic criteria for this condition. Several diagnostic systems have since been developed with a view to capturing the wide spectrum of physical and behavioral anomalies resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. The purpose of the current paper is to outline the evolution of FAS as a medical diagnosis. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Defining the behavioral phenotype in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A review
A1  - Kodituwakku P.W.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - While there exists a large body of literature on cognitive functions in children with prenatal alcohol exposure, it remains undetermined if these children exhibit a unique profile of cognitive-behavioral functioning or a behavioral phenotype. Researchers have consistently found that intellectual functioning, as assessed by IQ tests, of children with prenatal alcohol exposure is deficient. There is increasing evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with slow information processing and attentional problems, in particular inattentiveness. Studies examining specific cognitive abilities such as language, visual perception, and memory in alcohol-affected children have shown performance decrements associated with increased task complexity. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure have also been found to exhibit significant deficits in daily functional skills or adaptive behavior, with deficits in socialization becoming pronounced during adolescence. The above findings point to the conclusion that a generalized deficit in complex information processing constitutes the central cognitive-behavioral characteristic of children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Researchers have consistently documented that specific brain regions are more affected by alcohol than other regions. The problem of mapping focal anomalies of the brain with a generalized pattern of deficits can be solved by taking developmental processes into consideration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A practical clinical approach to diagnosis
A1  - Manning M.A.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - In utero exposure to alcohol can have numerous adverse effects on a developing fetus. These effects represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities that have recently been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Children at the most severe end of this spectrum and displaying the complete phenotype of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system are defined as having fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). While FAS is the most readily clinically recognized form of FASD, other categories within the continuum of adverse effects due to prenatal alcohol exposure are becoming better defined. These include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). As more is learned regarding the exact manifestations of alcohol on brain development, these classifications may be expanded and/or refined. Because FASD represents a major public health concern, early recognition of at-risk children is important for initiating interventional strategies. Thus, the purpose of this report is to educate practicing physicians about the recognizable phenotypes of FASD in order to accurately identify these children and implement the most appropriate management plans. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have numerous adverse growth, structural and neurodevelopmental consequences for the developing fetus. This spectrum of disabilities has been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The most severe condition in this continuum of disability is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by a distinctive pattern of facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system that often include mental retardation. Children with FASD who manifest some, but not all, of the features of FAS can be further categorized as having partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Specific structural birth defects (e.g. malformations of the heart, kidneys and/or musculoskeletal system) are the hallmark of ARBD in a child with normal growth and development; whereas, ARND comprises a specific pattern of disordered behavior and development among alcohol exposed children with normal growth and structural development. In addiction medicine, some evidence indicates that prenatal alcohol exposure can increase the risk for behavioral disorders, including depression and negative self-esteem in the offspring of alcoholic women. Furthermore, prenatal alcohol exposure may result in long-term neurocognitive disorders involving problems with executive functioning, higher level language deficits and behavioral disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize what recently has been reported regarding specific criteria for defining and diagnosing the conditions within the overarching term FASD. Such criteria allow the continuum of FASD to be more readily diagnosed by practicing pediatricians, thereby leading to earlier intervention and amelioration of related medical and behavioral disorders.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health problem and is an established cause of serious birth defects and developmental delay collectively described as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is caused by congenital alcohol-induced damages and is a cause of mental retardation. It is characterised by facial abnormalities and growth deficiency. Infants affected by the syndrome show intellectual impairment, and difficulties in learning, memory, problem-solving, and attention as well as experiencing additional problems with mental health and social interactions. However, an absence of the characteristic facial defects and growth deficiency may result in a failure to identify children with prenatal alcohol exposure, which can further present as alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorder (ARND) or alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Estimates of prevalence of FAS in U.S.A. range between 0.3 to 2.2 per 1,000 live births, but much higher rates occurring in some communities. Harmonisation of the methodology used for epidemiological studies, with research activities that establishes real baseline prevalence of FAS and identification of women who are at highest risk of bearing a FAS-affected child, are an essential prerequisite to prevention. In addition, it is essential to assess different FAS preventive approaches through carefully controlled studies. Universal, selected, and indicated preventive strategies have been identified, targeting different kind of populations. Since FAS and other adverse effects of drinking during pregnancy are theoretically completely preventable, it is vital to make more efforts to improve the application of the most appropriate interventions. Although in Italy alcohol consumption has constantly increased, mainly amongst the young (including women of childbearing age), knowledge on FAS and alcohol-related effects is completely lacking. Because of the high cost for care of individuals with this syndrome, it is essential to apply appropriate interventions to prevent this problem.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD) is one of the most preventable sources of developmental abnormalities, and has a singular cause-alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Estimates for the costs of treatment of a single case of FASD range often above one million dollars. The primary strategy for prevention currently centers on no alcohol consumption during pregnancy. However, a sizeable number of North American women currently drink during pregnancy. A literature review examined the behavior of maternal alcohol consumption in order to understand the rationale associated with drinking. Generally, it appears that pregnant women differ by their alcohol consumption habits and their reasons to drink. In an attempt to eliminate FASD, we review a number of educational, legal, and community-based programs that have been used to promote abstinence and examine where they have been successful. Unfortunately, social marketing strategies have received less attention. Several potential applications of social marketing directed to drinkingduring- pregnancy campaigns are suggested, and possible contributions to the overall effort are explained.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) consists of multi-system abnormalities and is caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of alcohol on the human foetus has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and FAS is the most important human teratogenic condition known today. The purpose of this study was to analyse the craniofacial parameters of children with FAS and compare them with matched controls. Ninety children diagnosed with FAS (45 males, 45 females) and 90 controls were matched for age, gender, and social class. The mean age of the FAS children was 8.9 years with the controls slightly older at 9.1 years. This age difference was not significant (P = 0.34). A standard lateral cephalometric radiograph of each subject was taken. The radiographs were digitized for 20 linear and 17 angular measurements. These 37 variables were formulated to assess the size, shape, and relative position of three craniofacial complexes: (1) the cranial base, (2) midface, and (3) mandible. In addition, nine variables were computed to compare the soft tissue profiles. The study showed that measurements related to face height and mandibular size appear to be the most important features when distinguishing FAS children. Overall, the FAS children in the present study presented with vertically and horizontally underdeveloped maxillae, together with features of long face syndrome with large gonial angles and a short ramus in relation to total face height. There was also a tendency for the development of an anterior open bite, which appears to be compensated for by an increase in the vertical dimension of the anterior alveolar process to bring the incisor teeth into occlusion. The latter adaptation occurred mainly in the mandible. © The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Orthodontics Society. All rights reserved.

N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) consists of multisystem abnormalities and is caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of alcohol on the human foetus has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and FAS is one of the most important human teratogenic conditions known today. The purpose of this study was to assess the dental age (DA) and skeletal age (SA) of children with FAS and compare them with matched controls. The samples of 90 children diagnosed with FAS and 90 controls were matched for age, gender, and social class. The mean chronological age (CA) of the FAS subjects was 8.95 years, with the controls slightly older at 9.04 years. This difference was not significant. Dental maturity was determined by assessing the stage of tooth formation and SA assessment was made from hand-wrist radiographs for the patients and controls by assigning a SA and comparing it with standard plates. The means and standard deviations of CA and DA for the stages of calcification were calculated and the Pearson ranked order correlation coefficient was applied to measure the associations between skeletal maturity indicators and DA. t-tests were used to test for group differences between independent groups, and paired t-tests to determine paired group differences. This study provided evidence of a positive association between DA and SA in both the FAS children and the controls. The data suggest that both DA and SA may be a reflection of general somatic growth. It must be acknowledged that growth of individuals is often irregular, when any norms of development based on central tendencies and variabilities of healthy children are applied. Some aspects of growth and development for healthy children may show a variable pattern of growth. Therefore, correlation of these aspects of growth and development will often not show the degree of correlation that theoretically exists between different areas of growth and development. A more complete appraisal of the entire skeleton and an evaluation of the entire dentition, rather than just the mandibular teeth, might improve the correlation between the variables. © The Author 2006.

T1  - Detection of in vivo DNA damage induced by ethanol in multiple organs of pregnant mice using the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay

N2  - Ethanol is principal ingredient of alcohol beverage, but considered as human carcinogen, and has neurotoxicity. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy often causes fetal alcohol syndrome. The DNA damage is one of the important factors in carcinogenicity or teratogenicity. To detect the DNA damage induced by ethanol, we used an in vivo alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay in pregnant mice organs and embryos. Pregnant ICR mice on Day 7 of gestation were treated with 2, 4 or 8 g/kg ethanol, and maternal organs/tissues and embryos were subjected to the Comet assay at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr after ethanol treatment. Four and 8 g/kg ethanol induced DNA damage in brain, lung and embryos at 4 or 8 hr after the treatment. Two g/kg ethanol did not cause any DNA damage, and 8 g/kg ethanol only increased the duration of DNA damage without distinct increase in the degree of the damage. No significant DNA damage was observed in the liver. To detect the effect of acetaldehyde, disulfiram, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, was administered before 4 g/kg ethanol treatment. No significant increase of DNA damage was observed in the disulfiram pre-treated group. These data indicate that ethanol induces DNA damage, which might be related to ethanol toxicity. Since pre-treatment of disulfiram did not increase DNA damage, DNA damage observed in this study might not be the effect of acetaldehyde.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Objective and methods: To explore association between prevalence of ADHD and levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure, the authors reviewed the charts of 2,231 youth referred for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Participants were categorized into four groups by different levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure. For each group, the prevalence rates of ADHD and other selected disorders were determined. Results: The disorder ranking first in overall prevalence was ADHD (41%), followed by learning disorder (17%) and oppositional-defiant/conduct disorder (16%). Prevalence rates of ADHD across the groups generally were high risk > some risk > unknown risk > no risk. Conclusion: The frequency distribution of ADHD cases was according to the levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure. These results add to a growing body of evidence supporting an association between ADHD and prenatal alcohol exposure. Findings need to be confirmed by definitive studies on ADHD and gestational alcohol exposure. © 2006 Sage Publications.

T1  - Comparison of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and the hoyme diagnostic guidelines for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
A1  - Astley S.J.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - OBJECTIVE. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and the Hoyme fetal alcohol spectrum disorders diagnostic guidelines differ markedly. The performances of the 2 diagnostic systems were compared. METHODS. The fetal alcohol syndrome diagnostic criteria from the 4-Digit Code and Hoyme guidelines were applied to 952 patients who had received an interdisciplinary, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, diagnostic evaluation at the University of Washington with the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and 16 children with confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure. RESULTS. The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome was 3.7% with the 4-Digit Code and 4.1% with the Hoyme guidelines. Although the prevalences were similar, the patients identified were not. Only 17 individuals met the fetal alcohol syndrome criteria for both systems. An extraordinary number of patients (35%) met the Hoyme criteria for the fetal alcohol syndrome facial phenotype, but only 39 of those 330 patients met the Hoyme criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome. Even some children with no alcohol exposure (25%) had the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome face. The specificities of the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome face for the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome diagnosis and prenatal alcohol exposure were low in these populations. CONCLUSIONS. Without a specific facial phenotype, a valid diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome cannot be rendered for patients with prenatal alcohol exposure, because a causal link between their outcomes and exposure cannot be established, and a valid diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome cannot be rendered for patients with unknown alcohol exposure, because the face cannot serve as a valid proxy measure for alcohol exposure. Diagnostic guidelines must confirm the specificity of their fetal alcohol syndrome facial criteria to validate their diagnostic criteria. Copyright © 2006 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

T1  - Myelin degeneration in peripheral nerve in chick embryos following continuous ethanol exposure during early gestational period: A preliminary report
A1  - Chaudhuri J.D.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized among other features by motor and sensory derangements and neurobehavioral deficits. However, no specific changes in the brain and spinal cord that could conclusively explain these neuronal defects have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of continuous ethanol exposure during early gestation on the peripheral nerve, towards the understanding of neuronal disorders in FAS. A chick model of FAS was used and embryos were exposed to 5%, 10% and 15% ethanol on embryonic days 1-8. The effects on general growth and development, and on the peripheral nerve of ethanol-exposed embryos were examined following the full period of gestation. There was significant reduction in crown rump length, head circumference and body weight in ethanol exposed chicks when compared with appropriate control groups. The growth retardation among the different alcohol exposed groups was dose dependent and prenatal mortality of embryos was seen in embryos exposed to 10% and 15% ethanol. Features of myclin degeneration were observed in the peripheral nerve in majority of chick embryos exposed to 10% and 15% ethanol as compared to embryos exposed to 5% ethanol as well as in the control groups. Thus, this study demonstrates the dose dependent effects of continuous prenatal ethanol exposure in a chick model of FAS. More significantly, it demonstrates the detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing peripheral nerve.

N2  - Background: Peer relationship problems are a significant part of the clinical presentation of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Many of these children have been prescribed psychotropic medications by community practitioners. The present study reports on the interaction between medication status and parent and teacher-reported outcomes for parent-assisted Children's Friendship Training (CFT). Methods: Seventy seven children (40 boys and 37 girls, age range was 71-139 months) diagnosed with FASD were given 12 sessions of CFT. Parent- and teacher-reported social outcomes were compared across four subgroups of children who were prescribed either stimulant or neuroleptic medication, neither or both types of medications. Results: According to parent and teacher reports, children prescribed neuroleptic medication showed greater improvement on all outcome measures when compared to children not prescribed neuroleptics. In contrast, children prescribed stimulant medication either failed to show improvement or showed poorer outcomes when compared to children not prescribed stimulants. Implications: Children with FASD frequently present with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. The present results suggest physicians routinely ask about prenatal alcohol exposure as part of history taking to treat children more effectively who appear to be displaying attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptomatology but who may have FASD.

N2  - Typically, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are not diagnosed in children until developmental problems become apparent. To diagnose these children earlier would benefit both them and their caregivers. Neonatal cranial ultrasound has great potential diagnostic utility in the presence of known heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, in that it allows us to gather critical neuroanatomical information before the fontanel closes. This report describes the case of Baby S, in which the neonatal ultrasound was crucial in obtaining early fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) diagnosis and facilitating an array of interventions for which the baby would not otherwise have been eligible. Now four years old, Baby S has received care in many different forms, and is making substantial progress. The early FAS diagnosis and subsequent interventions may have ameliorated, and continue to ameliorate, the poor developmental prognosis for many individuals with FASD.

T1  - Alcohol consumption in the new millennium - Weighing up the risks and benefits for our health
A1  - Foster R.K.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Alcohol is produced via the anaerobic fermentation of sugars by yeast and involves glucose molecules (C6H12O6) being broken down to yield ethanol (C2H5OH), carbon dioxide (CO5) and energy. The amount of alcohol contained in different alcoholic beverages varies considerably and is referred to as the 'strength' of the drink, which is expressed as the percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV). A standard unit of alcohol in the UK equates to 8g or 10ml of pure alcohol. Guidelines for sensible drinking set by the UK government are 3-4 units (24-32g) a day or less for men, and 2-3 units (16-24g) a day or less for women. Specific recommendations have been set for those planning pregnancy and pregnant women, who should drink no more than 1-2 units of alcohol once or twice a week and should avoid heavy drinking sessions. Guidelines for sensible drinking are similar in other countries. When taking into account the standard drink unit used to define guidelines, the most commonly recommended limit is 24g/day for men and 20g/day for women. Older people are more likely to drink in line with the sensible drinking guidelines, as they tend to consume alcohol over a period of time, as opposed to consuming large quantities on one or two days of the week, a practice that is more popular among younger people. Consuming double the sensible drinking guidelines in one day is classified as binge drinking (an alternative definition is drinking until intoxicated). It has become recognised that binge drinking is a common phenomenon in the UK, particularly among younger people. Other factors, such as income, ethnicity and region of residence, are also recognised to be predictive of the quantity of alcohol consumed; for example, higher-income households are more likely to consume large quantities of alcohol and consume alcohol more frequently. The quantity of alcohol consumed is an important factor in determining how it affects health and well-being. In terms of nutritional health, chronic excessive alcohol intake is well recognised to affect an individual's nutrient status, because it reduces food intake and/or may interfere with the digestion, absorption, metabolism and utilisation of some nutrients. However, when consumed in moderation, alcohol is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of nutrients or be associated with impaired vitamin function or depletion to an extent that may harm health, provided that dietary intakes are adequate. Alcoholic beverages contain alcohol, carbohydrate and only small amounts of some vitamins, trace elements and minerals. They are therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to micronutrient intake. Any association that exists between moderate alcohol consumption and the absorption and metabolism of nutrients from the diet is dependant on a number of factors, including: the nutrient in question; habitual intake of the nutrient and the nutritional status of the individual; and the quantity of alcohol consumed over a period of time. Overall, little information exists about the implications of binge drinking on nutrient status; but it may alter food intake, and excessive alcohol consumption can cause disturbances to the digestive system. While infrequent binge drinking is unlikely to have any long-term nutritional implications (although it may affect nutrient status in the short-term), regular binge drinking may have a more negative impact. Although alcoholic beverages tend to have few nutrients, they can be a significant source of energy, as alcohol provides 7kcal per gram. Studies indicate that alcoholic beverages are usually additive to an individual's normal energy intake and individuals are unlikely to compensate for energy from them during the day. The aperitif effect of alcohol may also encourage an increase in energy intake. It is therefore not surprising that alcohol intake has been associated with weight gain and an increase in body mass index (BMI) (with the exception of chronic excessive drinkers). However, there are a number of methodological problems that need to be considered when comparing the findings of studies investigating the association between alcohol intake and disease risk, including: potential misreporting of total intake; the use of an appropriate control group; and the need for comparable measurement units. Consumption of alcoholic beverages has also been associated with increasing the risk of ill-health associated with pre-existing conditions. For example, it may contribute to ulcer development or aggravate symptoms of existing ulcers. There is evidence that moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy may affect the development of the fetus's central nervous system, and may result in low birthweight. However, there is currently no consensus as to whether alcohol should be completely avoided during pregnancy. However, it is well recognised that excess alcohol consumption during pregnancy can put the fetus at risk of fetal alcohol syndrome. Quantity of alcohol consumed is particularly important when considering the association between alcohol and chronic diseases; for example, there is now strong evidence that light to moderate (1-3 drinks per day) consumption decreases the risk of a coronary heart disease (CHD) episode compared with abstainers (with particular benefits in men aged over 55years and post-menopausal women). However, heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of CHD. Further information is required to determine the association between drinking patterns and heart health. However, there is a consensus of opinion that it is the alcohol per se that influences heart health, rather than a particular type of alcoholic beverage; and other factors that affect an individual's choice of drink may be important in distorting the findings from studies that show otherwise. As with risk of CHD, light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk (of 30-40%) of type 2 diabetes, when compared with teetotallers. Heavy drinking may be associated with an increased risk, resulting in a 'J' or 'U' shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. A 'J' shaped relationship has also been reported between alcohol consumption and blood pressure. It is widely accepted that heavy alcohol intake is a risk factor for high blood pressure, and evidence indicates that moderate intakes may exert a short-term lowering effect, while abstainers/teetotallers are reported to have a higher blood pressure. The type of stroke is important when considering the association between stroke and alcohol, as any alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke, but low intakes (i.e. one drink per day) may have a protective effect on ischaemic stroke. Heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of both types of stroke. Alcohol intake has also been associated with an increased risk of cancers at a number of sites. However, a consensus for a likely causal association has only been identified between alcohol and cancers of the upper-aero digestive tract and liver. The mechanisms to explain the positive associations between alcohol and breast cancer, and alcohol and colorectal cancer, have yet to be identified. It is unclear whether some types of alcoholic beverage are more strongly associated with increased risk of cancer than others. Mechanisms identified to date suggest that it is the alcohol per se that exerts damage and, therefore, quantity of alcohol consumed is the most important variable. Studies looking at the relationship between alcohol and mortality suggest that 10-80g (approximately 1-8 drinks) of alcohol each week is optimal to reap the health benefits, but increased risk is noted at higher intakes (thus indicating a 'U' shaped relationship between alcohol intake and mortality). Gender and age are important factors when considering the association between alcohol and mortality. For example, for younger people, the benefits of alcohol may be outweighed by the increased risk of other diseases (e.g. alcohol-related cancers, liver cirrhosis) and increased risk of violence and accidents. Aggressive behaviour, increased risk taking and decreased responsiveness to social expectations, which may lead to personal 'harm', including accidents and violence, are usually the result of alcohol intoxication (i.e. through binge drinking). Excess alcohol consumption may also result in a 'hangover', which disrupts normal life through symptoms of fatigue and increased anxiety, and has economic consequences in the workplace through poor performance or absenteeism. The extent to which a hangover can affect an individual's performance, including psychomotor, recognition and managerial skills, is still being debated. Binge drinking is also associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies. Although the cost of binge drinking in terms of long-term health has yet to be established, the significant economic cost is well recognised. A number of population-based initiatives are underway to try and change the 'drinking culture', and thus reduce the incidence of binge drinking. Initiatives include: advertising campaigns; changes to alcohol advertising regulations; and changes to pub licensing regulations. © 2006 British Nutrition Foundation.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects brain structure and function. This study examined brain metabolism using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and searched for regions of specific vulnerability in adolescents and young adults prenatally exposed to alcohol. Methods: Ten adolescents and young adults with confirmed heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and a diagnosis within the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were included. Three of them had fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 3 had partial FAS (PFAS), and 4 had alcohol-related neurobehavioral disorder (ARND). The control group consisted of 10 adolescents matched for age, sex, head circumference, handedness, and body mass. Exclusionary criteria were learning disorders and prenatal alcohol exposure. Three-dimensional 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( 1H MRSI) was performed in the cerebrum and cerebellum. Metabolite ratios N-acetylaspartate/choline (NAA/Cho), NAA/creatine (Cr) and Cho/Cr, and absolute metabolite intensities were calculated for several anatomic regions. Results: In patients with FASD, lower NAA/Cho and/or NAA/Cr compared with controls were found in parietal and frontal cortices, frontal white matter, corpus callosum, thalamus, and cerebellar dentate nucleus. There was an increase in the absolute intensity of the glial markers Cho and Cr but no change in the neuronal marker NAA. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure alters brain metabolism in a long-standing or permanent manner in multiple brain areas. These changes are in accordance with previous findings from structural and functional studies. Metabolic alterations represent changes in the glial cell pool rather than in the neurons.

N2  - Background: Researchers are increasingly considering the importance of motor functioning of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The purpose of this study was to assess the motor development of young children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) to determine the presence and degree of delay in their motor skills and to compare their motor development with that of matched children without FAS. Methods: The motor development of 14 children ages 20 to 68 months identified with FAS was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). In addition, 2 comparison groups were utilized. Eleven of the children with FAS were matched for chronological age, gender, ethnicity, and communication age to: (1) 11 children with prenatal alcohol exposure who did not have FAS and (2) 11 matched children without any reported prenatal alcohol exposure. The motor scores on the VABS were compared among the 3 groups. Results: Most of the young children with FAS in this study showed clinically important delays in their motor development as measured on the VABS Motor Domain, and their fine motor skills were significantly more delayed than their gross motor skills. In the group comparisons, the young children with FAS had significantly lower Motor Domain standard (MotorSS) scores than the children not exposed to alcohol prenatally. They also had significantly lower Fine Motor Developmental Quotients than the children in both the other groups. No significant group differences were found in gross motor scores. For MotorSS scores and Fine Motor Developmental Quotients, the means and standard errors indicated a continuum in the scores from FAS to prenatal alcohol exposure to nonexposure. Conclusions: These findings strongly suggest that all young children with FAS should receive complete developmental evaluations that include assessment of their motor functioning, to identify problem areas and provide access to developmental intervention programs that target deficit areas such as fine motor skills. Fine motor delays in children with FAS may be related to specific neurobehavioral deficits that affect fine motor skills. The findings support the concept of an FASD continuum in some areas of motor development. Copyright © 2006 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) offer unique, noninvasive methods of measuring, respectively, in vivo quantitative neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. The main purpose of the present study was to identify and compare the neuroanatomical and neurochemical abnormalities that are associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol in both fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)-diagnosed children and those diagnosed with fetal alcohol effects (FAE). MR data of three age-, gender- and race-balanced groups of children, FAS-diagnosed, FAE-diagnosed and non-exposed controls, were compared. Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, regardless of diagnosis, were found in the caudate nucleus. Specifically, a significantly smaller caudate nucleus was found for the FAS and FAE participants compared to the controls. In addition, the metabolite ratio of N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr), an indicator of neuronal function, in left caudate nucleus of both the FAS and FAE participants was elevated compared to the control group. Analysis of absolute concentrations revealed that the increase in the ratio of NAA/Cr was due to an increase in NAA alone. Although its exact function in the CNS is unknown, NAA is believed to be a neuronal marker due to its exclusive localization to neurons. Some also speculate a role for NAA in myelination. Elevated NAA in the prenatal alcohol-exposed participants could indicate a lack of normal program cell death, dendritic pruning and/or myelination during development. The present study demonstrates that prenatal alcohol-exposed children, with or without facial dysmorphology, have abnormal brain anatomy and chemistry. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Effect of a single dose of ethanol on developing peripheral nerve of chick embryos
A1  - Chaudhuri J.D.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Fetal Alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy. It is characterized by physical and mental growth retardation, craniofacial anomalies and derangements of numerous body systems. A particular distressing feature of FAS is affection of the nervous system, which manifest as motor and sensory derangements and neurobehavioral deficits. However, no specific changes in the brain and spinal cord that could conclusively explain these neuronal defects have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single high dose of ethanol exposure during early gestation on the peripheral nerve, with a view to understanding the neuronal disorders appearing in FAS. A chick model of FAS was used and embryos were exposed to 5%, 10% and 15% ethanol immediately after hatching. The effects on general growth and development and on the peripheral nerve of ethanol-exposed embryos were examined following the full period of gestation. There was a significant reduction in crown-rump length, head circumference and body weight in ethanol-exposed chicks as compared with appropriate control groups. The degree of growth retardation among the different alcohol exposed groups was dose dependent and significant prenatal embryo mortality was seen in those exposed to 15% ethanol. In embryos that survived the exposure to 15% ethanol, features of myelin degeneration were observed in the peripheral nerve in the majority of cases. No features of myelin degeneration were observed in embryos exposed to 5% and 10% ethanol or in the control groups. This study demonstrates the direct toxic effects of a single high dose of ethanol on developing embryos in general and the peripheral nerves in particular. Accordingly the pathological changes observed in peripheral nerves could account for some of the neurobehavioral deficits observed in FAS.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is associated with macrostructural brain abnormalities, neurocognitive deficits, and behavioral disturbances, is characterized as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in severe cases. The only published study thus far using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed microstructural abnormalities in patients with FAS. The current study investigated whether similar abnormalities are present in less severely affected, prenatally exposed patients who did not display all of the typical FAS physical stigmata. Methods: Subjects included 14 children, ages 10 to 13, with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and 13 matched controls. Cases with full-criteria FAS, mental retardation, or microcephaly were excluded. Subjects underwent MRI scans including DTI. Results: Although cases with microcephaly were excluded, there was a trend toward smaller total cerebral volume in the FASD group (p=0.057, Cohen's d effect size =0.73). Subjects with FASD had greater mean diffusivity (MD) in the isthmus of the corpus callosum than controls (p=0.013, effect size =1.05), suggesting microstructural abnormalities in this region. There were no group differences in 5 other regions of the corpus callosum. Correlations between MD in the isthmus and facial dysmorphology were nonsignificant. Conclusions: These results suggest that even relatively mild forms of fetal alcohol exposure may be associated with microstructural abnormalities in the posterior corpus callosum that are detectable with DTI.

N2  - Background: This work was conducted in an effort to establish an oral intake model system in which the effects of ethanol insult that occur during early stages of embryogenesis can be easily examined and in which agents that may modulate ethanol's teratogenicity can be readily tested in vivo. The model system described utilizes the alcohol deprivation effect to obtain teratogenic levels of maternal ethanol intake on days 7 and 8 of pregnancy in C57Bl/6J mice. Ocular defects including microphthalmia and uveal coloboma, which have previously been shown to result from ethanol administered by gavage or via intraperitoneal injection on these days, served as the developmental end point for this study. The ocular defects are readily identifiable and their degree of severity is expected to correlate with concurrently developing defects of the central nervous system (CNS). Methods: Female C57Bl/6J mice were maintained on an ethanol-containing (4.8% v/v) liquid diet for 14 days and then mated during a subsequent abstinence period. Mice were then reexposed to ethanol on days 7 and 8 of pregnancy only. Control as well as ethanol-exposed dams were killed on their 14th day of pregnancy. Fetuses were then weighed, measured for crown rump length, photographed, and analyzed for ocular abnormalities. Globe size, palpebral fissure length, and pupil size and shape were noted for both the right and left eyes of all fetuses and informative comparisons were made. Results: This exposure paradigm resulted in peak maternal blood alcohol concentrations that ranged from 170 to 220 mg/dL on gestational day (GD) 8. Compared with the GD 14 fetuses from the normal control group, the pair-fed, acquisition controls, as well as the ethanol-exposed fetuses, were developmentally delayed and had reduced weights. Confirming previous studies, comparison of similarly staged control and treated GD 8 embryos illustrated reductions in the size of the forebrain in the latter. Subsequent ocular malformations were noted in 33% of the right eyes and 25% of the left eyes of the 103 GD 14 ethanol-exposed fetuses examined. This incidence of defects is twice that observed in the control groups. Additionally, it was found that the palpebral fissure length is directly correlated with globe size. Conclusions: The high incidence of readily identifiable ocular malformations produced by oral ethanol intake in this model and their relevance to human fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) makes this an excellent system for utilization in experiments involving factors administered to the embryo that might alter ethanol's teratogenic effects. Additionally, the fact that early ethanol insult yields ocular and forebrain abnormalities that are developmentally associated allows efficient specimen selection for subsequent detailed analyses of CNS effects in this in vivo mammalian FASD model.

Method: From a longitudinal prospective study beginning with interviews of 1,529 pregnant women, a birth cohort of about 500 newborns was chosen to include all of the most heavily alcohol exposed plus a sampling of the continuum of alcohol exposures from total abstinence through heavy drinking. At an average age of 25.7 years, 400 members of this birth cohort were administered valid Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV (SCID), including both the SCID for axis I disorders and the SCID for axis II personality disorders. Results: The odds of the appearance of six psychiatric disorders and traits were more than double in adults exposed to one or more binge alcohol episodes in utero. Three of these six odds ratios were uniformly stable against confounding: axis I substance dependence or abuse disorders and axis II passive-aggressive and antisocial personality disorders or traits. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to alcohol may be a risk factor for specific psychiatric disorders and traits in early adulthood, even in a nonclinical group.

N2  - Context: Little is known about the contribution of fetal alcohol exposure to the development of alcohol disorders in early adulthood. Objective: To examine the independent effect of maternal alcohol use during early vs late periods in pregnancy on the time of onset of alcohol disorders in offspring. Design: Follow-up study of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy and Its Outcomes (MUSP), a population-based birth cohort study commenced in Brisbane, Australia, in 1981 and designed to examine the association of maternal alcohol exposure with the onset of alcohol disorders. Mothers and children were followed up at birth, 6 months, and 5, 14, and 21 years after the initial interview. Maternal alcohol use was assessed before pregnancy, in early and late pregnancy, and at the 5- and 14-year follow-up visits. Alcohol disorders in early adulthood were assessed at age 21 years using the lifetime version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-computerized version. Setting: Population-based birth cohort study. Participants: A subsample of 2138 participants for whom complete data were available at the 21-year follow-up. Main Outcome Measure: Onset of alcohol disorder from adolescence to 21 years of age. Results: In utero alcohol exposure of 3 or more glasses was associated with alcohol disorders. The fully adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of developing early-onset alcohol disorders at age 21 years were 2.95 (1.62-5.36) for those exposed to maternal drinking in early pregnancy and 1.35 (0.69-2.63) for those exposed in late pregnancy. There was also a strong association between alcohol exposure in early pregnancy and late-onset alcohol disorders (odds ratio, 3.29 [95% confidence interval, 1.74-6.24]). Conclusions: Our results provide support for a biological origin of adult alcohol disorders and suggest that the association is not explained solely by maternal drinking or smoking during childhood and adolescence or other intervening factors. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the association. ©2006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Accurate estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in a Western European population are lacking and are of particular interest in settings where the usual pattern of alcohol consumption is thought to be daily drinking with meals. To address these issues, an epidemiology study of FAS and other FASD was undertaken in Italian schools. Methods: Primary schools (n=25) in 2 health districts of the Lazio region were randomly selected and recruited for the study. Five hundred forty-three children, 50% of those enrolled in first-grade classes, received parental permission to participate in a 2-tiered, active case ascertainment screening process. Detailed evaluation of children selected in a preliminary screening phase was carried out on those who were small for height, weight, and head circumference and/or referred by teachers for suspected learning and behavioral problems. Detailed evaluation was carried out on each child's: (1) physical growth and dysmorphology, (2) psychological development and behavior, and (3) prenatal exposure to alcohol and other risk factors for FASD via maternal interviews. A group of 67 randomly selected children without FASD from the same classes was utilized as a comparison group. Results: Using 2 denominators for prevalence estimation, a conservative one and a strict sample-based estimate, the prevalence of FAS in this province of Italy was 3.7 to 7.4 per 1,000 children. When cases of partial FAS (PFAS) and a case of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental deficits (ARND) were added to FAS cases, the rate of FASD was 20.3 to 40.5 per 1,000 and estimated at 35 per 1,000 overall or between 2.3 and 4.1% of all children. This exceeds previously published estimates of both FAS and FASD for the western world. Detailed data are presented that demonstrate the utility of the guidelines of the revised Institute of Medicine diagnostic criteria for FASD. Children with FASD are significantly more impaired/affected (p<0.05) than randomly selected comparison children on all measures of growth deficiency, key facial features of FASD, overall dysmorphology scores, language comprehension, nonverbal IQ, and behavior. Maternal reports of current drinking were significantly higher for mothers of FASD children than comparison mothers, but reported rates of overall drinking during pregnancy were not significantly different. In contrast to expectations, daily drinking among mothers of the comparison group was not common. However, dysmorphology scores of the children were significantly correlated with drinking in the second and third trimesters, drinks per current drinking day, and current drinks per month. Finally, children with the physical features of FASD had lower IQs; nonverbal IQ was significantly correlated with head circumference and negatively correlated with overall dysmorphology score, smooth philtrum, and several other facial and physical anomalies characteristic of FAS. Conclusions: Using careful measures of ascertainment in a primary school setting, these results provide relatively high estimates of the prevalence of FASD and raise the question of whether FASD is more common in the western world than previously estimated.

N2  - Ancient scripture and paintings together with several medical reports on the effect of alcohol on the newborn over the past 300 years finally led to the description of the fetal alcohol syndrome in the 1970s by French and American research groups. Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can result in the specific pattern of malformations and neurocognitive deficits characteristic of this syndrome. Diagnostic criteria and classifications have been developed and in the 1990s reports showed the long-term consequences for these children. In recent years several studies from different countries have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure will lead to life-long consequences on physical development, intellectual development, behavior, social development, occupation, independence, sexuality or sexual behavior and increased risk of suicidality. In this review of long-term observation studies we found that the prenatal exposure to alcohol have permanent and life-long damage, which impair both the social and occupational future of the person exposed with a need for life-long assistance in order for that person to function at an optimal level. Primary prevention and early intervention with general public health educational efforts seems to be the best way forward.

N2  - Women who drink while pregnant are at a high risk of giving birth to children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Heavy consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is also known to be deleterious to fetal bone growth in both humans and laboratory animals. However, nothing is known regarding the effect of maternal moderate and heavy alcohol binging on fetal and maternal bone strength. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of moderate and heavy alcohol binging throughout gestation on fetal and maternal bone growth and strength. The study was conducted using an ovine model system. The large body mass of the ovine fetus, the longer gestation that is more similar to that of humans, and the fact that all three trimester equivalents occur in utero, make the sheep an excellent model for studying Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Suffolk ewes were mated and, beginning on gestational day 4, received intravenous infusions over 1 h on 3 consecutive days per week followed by 4 days without treatment concluding on day 132 of pregnancy. Pregnant ewes were divided into four groups: two alcohol treatment groups (0.75 and 1.75 g/kg of body weight), one pair-fed saline control group, and an untreated normal control group. The fetuses were harvested on gestational day 133. Maternal and fetal femoral and tibial dimensions were measured and the maximum strength (MPa) carried by the bone tissue was determined using a three-point bending procedure. Maternal bones were not different among groups. The higher alcohol dose resulted in reduced fetal femoral bone strength, whereas the tibial bone strength was lower when compared with the normal control subjects. In contrast, the lower alcohol dose increased fetal femoral strength compared to the normal control subjects. The alcohol-exposed fetal bones also tended to exhibit reduced lengths. We conclude that binge alcohol exposure throughout gestation resulted in dose-dependent differences in the maximum stress absorbed by the fetal bones. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - In Italy, little is known about the problems related to alcohol drinking during pregnancy. In this paper, the Italian literature about this subject is briefly reviewed. This first Italian experience of a field study, aimed to the assessment of the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in an area in the Rome province (Lazio region) is reported. This in-field study was performed in the school years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 in cooperation with American researchers, most from University of New Mexico (Albuquerque), and Italian researchers from University "la Sapienza" of Rome. First grade children (ndegree = 1086) of primary school were contacted to enter in the in-school study for the detection of FAS and FASD and were examined by the experts team of clinicians, pediatrics, psychologists. Preliminary consideration and the implications of this study for FASD prevention are discussed.

N2  - Over thirty years of research has revealed that prenatal exposure to alcohol has a devastating impact on the structure and function of the developing central nervous system. Imaging studies over the past ten years have improved our understanding of the structural alterations related to prenatal alcohol exposure and provided researchers with potential hypotheses for brain-behavior relationships. Structural alterations associated with prenatal alcohol exposure have been found in overall brain size, shape, and symmetry, along with regional decreases in white and gray matter. In addition, abnormalities have been noted in specific structures such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. This review demonstrates that specific areas of the brain may be more vulnerable to prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a large and rapidly increasing public health problem worldwide. Aside the full-blown FAS, multiple terms are used to describe the continuum of effects that result from prenatal exposure to alcohol, including the whole fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The revised Institute of Medicine (IOM) Diagnostic Classification System and the diagnostic criteria for FAS and FASD are reported, as well as the formation of the four-state FAS International Consortium and its aims, as the development of an information base that systematizes data collection that helps to determine at-high-risk populations, and to implement and test a scientific-based prevention/intervention model for at risk women. The Consortium was further enlarged, with the inclusion of some more states (including Italy), leading to the formation of the International Consortium for the Investigation of FASD. The objectives of the Consortium are reported, as well as its previous activities, the South Africa and Italy Projects (active case ascertainment initiatives), and its future activities.

N2  - Objective: In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), we have previously found an alteration in NMDA receptors suggesting mediation, at least in part, of alcohol-related learning deficit. NMDA and GABA receptors interact in a multisynaptic circuit for the regulation of the inhibitory tone through the CNS. The GABA receptor subunit GABAAalpha5 is involved in learning and is developmentally regulated, as it is excitatory in the perinatal brain and inhibitory in the adult. We were interested to evaluate alcohol's effect on GABAAalpha5 expression to further understand alcohol-induced learning dysfunction. Study design: Timed, pregnant C57B16/Jmice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol, 0.03 mL/kg ip) or control (saline). Embryos and brains were harvested 10 days after treatment, and brains from adult offspring were collected after evaluation in the Morris Water Maze, a well-established test for spatial learning. Gene expression included samples from at least 3 litters per timepoint, and calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to quantify GABAAalpha5 with GAPDH standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure significantly decreased GABAAalpha5 expression in the embryo (P < .02) and fetal brains (P < .01) 10 days after therapy. However, in adult brains GABAAalpha5 expression was increased versus controls (P < .01). As previously demonstrated, prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in deficits in adults learning the Morris Water Maze with controls learning faster (P < .05). Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure alters developmental GABAAalpha5 expression. This may further explain the long-lasting damage of alcohol on learning skills. Both the alcohol-induced reduction in the GABAAalpha5 subunit during development and up-regulation in adult brain may be related to learning deficits resulting in decreased learning potential caused by the developmental defect and an increased inhibition of learning resulting from increased expression as an adult. In combination with our previous findings, these suggest that alcohol-induced learning impairment is likely the result of alterations of both NMDA and GABA expression and function. © 2006 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are among the leading preventable causes of developmental disorders in the United States; however, recognition and prevention of these conditions cannot be achieved without informed and educated health providers. This commentary addresses the importance of recognition and prevention of FASDs through the use of well-established standardized practices of diagnosis, screening, and brief alcohol reduction counseling. It is hoped that more knowledge on currently available procedures will encourage their use in the provision of routine health care to all women of childbearing age.

T1  - Brain deficits associated with fetal alcohol exposure may be protected, in part, by peptides derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein
A1  - Sari Y.
A1  - Gozes I.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This review discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain and the potential use of derived peptides from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) in neuroprotection against the insults of alcohol. Alcohol is known to impede the growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through cellular apoptosis. Sari et al. have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure reduced the fetal brain weight, the size of the brain regions and the number of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure compromises neural tube midline development. Sari et al. further suggested that the timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy is critical to the induction of deficits in 5-HT neurons, as well as other types of neurons and consequently results in deficits in neural tube development. ADNF and ADNP are glial-derived proteins discovered to be induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These proteins are expressed during embryonic development. Functional assays and genetic manipulations have identified these proteins as highly important for neural tube closure and brain formation/development. The peptide derivatives of ADNF, ADNF-14 (VLGGGSALLRSIPA), ADNF-9 (or SALLRSIPA = SAL) and of ADNP, NAPVSIPQ = NAP have shown neuroprotective effects and have been proven to prevent brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. Here, we discuss the many aspects of alcohol-associated growth restriction in the developing brain and the potential inhibition of this severe phenotype through the use of neuroprotective peptides. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - A retrospective review of self-reported alcohol intake among women attending for antenatal care in Far North Queensland
A1  - Rimmer C.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are known to occur among children delivered to women in Far North Queensland; to date, the problem has not been quantified or related directly to maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Aims: To identify the characteristics of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy, in order to identify 'high-risk' women to whom educational intervention regarding fetal alcohol syndrome may be targeted. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study using the case notes of all women attending the antenatal booking clinic in Cairns Base Hospital over the 3-month period from April to June 2005. Obstetric and demographic information and self-reported alcohol intake before and during pregnancy were noted and self-reported alcohol intake before and during pregnancy. Results: Five hundred and forty-one women were included in this study. Of these women, 24.6% were found to consume alcohol during pregnancy and 57.7% were found to consume alcohol before pregnancy, indicating a reduction in alcohol consumed once women became aware of pregnancy. The most significant indicator for alcohol consumption during pregnancy was found to be alcohol consumption before pregnancy. Of women who consumed alcohol in pregnancy, 71.5% drank moderate amounts of alcohol before pregnancy and 28.7% drank heavily before pregnancy. Conclusion: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is common in Far North Queensland. Methods currently used during antenatal booking visits to determine alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy are unreliable. Strategies to identify women consuming alcohol before and during pregnancy and education programs are vitally important if the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome and spectrum disorder is to be reduced. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading cause of preventable mental retardation and developmental disabilities, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Current medical guidelines recommend that no alcohol should be consumed over the period of conception and throughout pregnancy. Although the majority of women reduce alcohol consumption when they realize they are pregnant, this recognition may not occur until well into the first trimester, potentially impacting embryonic development. Objectives: To describe and assess changes in patterns of women's alcohol use between the preconception, pre-pregnancy recognition and post-pregnancy recognition time periods. Secondly, to describe characteristics of women consuming any alcohol and those binge drinking during pre- and post-pregnancy recognition periods. Methods: Computer assisted telephone interviews were conducted with 1042 women who had recently delivered a baby in urban Alberta, Canada. Differences in consumption patterns between time periods were analyzed using analysis of variance and Chi-square tests. Characteristics of those drinking both before and after pregnancy recognition were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: Eighty percent of women reported alcohol consumption pre-conceptually, 50% pre-pregnancy recognition and 18% post-pregnancy recognition. Binge drinking was reported by 32%, 11% and 0% for preconception, pre-pregnancy recognition and post-pregnancy recognition periods, respectively. Alcohol consumption patterns (i.e., the mean number of drinks per drinking day and week) did not differ significantly between preconception and pre-pregnancy recognition periods but did significantly drop after pregnancy recognition (p<0.001). Alcohol use during the period of pre-pregnancy recognition was higher among those not planning a pregnancy, not using assisted reproductive technology, of higher income, without a history of miscarriage, who were Caucasian, and who used tobacco. Binge drinking was higher among women not planning a pregnancy, those who used tobacco, and those with low self-esteem. Women continuing to drink small amounts of alcohol after pregnancy recognition were more likely to be between the ages of 30-39 years, be Caucasian and use tobacco. Conclusion: Preconception and "well-women" counseling strategies would be improved by increasing the emphasis on the risks of alcohol use during periods when pregnancy can occur. ©2006 Marshfield Clinic.

N2  - Background: In most cases of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), the pathognomonic facial features are absent making diagnosis challenging, if not impossible, particularly when no history of maternal drinking is available. Also because FASD is often comorbid with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), children with FASD are frequently improperly diagnosed and receive the wrong treatment. Since access to psychological testing is typically limited or non-existent in remote areas, other diagnostic methods are needed to provide necessary interventions. Objectives: To determine if a characteristic behavioural phenotype distinguishes children with FASD from typically developing children and children with ADHD and use this information to create a screening tool for FASD diagnosis. Methods: Parents and caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a well-established standardized tool for evaluating children's behavioural problems. Results from 30 children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disability, 30 children with ADHD, and 30 typically developing healthy children matched for age and socioeconomic status with FASD were analyzed. Based on our previous work, 12 CBCL items that significantly differentiated FASD and control groups were selected for further analyses. Stepwise discriminant function analysis identified behavioural characteristics most strongly differentiating groups and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analyses determined sensitivity and specificity of different item combinations. Results: Seven items reflecting hyperactivity, inattention, lying and cheating, lack of guilt, and disobedience significantly differentiated children with FASD from controls. ROC analyses showed scores of 6 or higher on these items differentiated groups with a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 82%. For FASD and ADHD, two combinations of items significantly differentiated groups with high sensitivity and specificity (i) no guilt, cruelty, and acts young (sensitivity = 70%; specificity = 80% (ii) acts young, cruelty, no guilt, lying or cheating, steals from home, and steals outside (sensitivity = 81%; specificity = 72%). These items were used to construct a potential FASD screening tool. Conclusions: Our findings identifying the behavioural characteristics differentiating children with FASD from typically developing children or children with ADHD have the potential for development of an empirically derived tool for FASD tool to be used in remote areas where psychological services are not readily available. This technique may speed up diagnosis and intervention for children without ready access to formal assessments. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related birth defects represent a spectrum of disorders that can result from the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that alcohol exposure in utero adversely affects hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Neonatal mice that were exposed in utero to alcohol showed a marked delay in B lymphocyte development. Recent studies have focused on an oligopotential progenitor cell, with the phenotype of HSAloCD43loLin-, which yields both B cells and myeloid lineage cells at a high frequency when cultured in vitro with stromal cells and the appropriate cytokines. However, these progenitor cells isolated from neonatal offspring of alcohol fed dams showed a significant decrease in the frequency of B cell formation following in vitro culture. In order to understand the mechanism underlying this defect we examined the expression of key transcription factors (early B cell factor, EBF, and Pax5) in this progenitor pool. Here, we report that >95% of HSAloCD43loLin- cells express EBF and 5% express Pax5. Following liquid culture in the presence of IL-7, these progenitor cells respond by up-regulating Pax5 and the surface expression of CD19 indicating that the cells have committed to the B lineage. By contrast 75% of HSAloCD43loLin- cells isolated from the bone marrow of neonatal animals exposed in utero to alcohol expressed EBF but at a level that was less than 25% the level of cells isolated from control animals. Furthermore, these alcohol-exposed progenitor cells failed to up-regulate Pax5 in response to IL-7 indicating a greatly reduced capacity to expand and differentiate to B lineage cells in liquid cultures. However, the HSAloCD43loLin- cells isolated from the alcohol exposed animals retained the capacity to differentiate to myeloid lineage cells. These results suggest that the interference with the sequential expression of transcription factors in early progenitor cells by in utero alcohol exposure is a potential mechanism for the observed decrease in B lymphocytes in neonatal mice. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Biomarkers of fetal exposure to alcohol are important to establish so that early detection and intervention can be made on these infants to prevent undesirable outcomes. The aim of this study was to analyze long-chain fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium as potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure and effect. Methods: Fatty acid ethyl esters were analyzed in the meconium of 124 singleton infants by positive chemical ionization gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and correlated to maternal ethanol use. Results: A total of 124 mother/infant dyads were enrolled in the study: 31 were in the control group and 93 were in the alcohol-exposed group. The incidence (28% vs 9.7%, p=0.037) of ethyl linoleate detected in meconium was significantly higher in the alcohol-exposed groups than the control groups. Similarly, when the concentrations of ethyl linoleate in meconium were grouped (trichotomized), there was a significant linear by linear association between alcohol exposure and group concentrations of ethyl linoleate (p=0.013). Furthermore, only alcohol-exposed infants were found in the group with the highest ethyl linoleate concentration. The sensitivity of ethyl linoleate in detecting prenatal alcohol exposure was only 26.9%, and its specificity and positive predictive value were 96.8 and 96.2%, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the concentration of ethyl linoleate in meconium and absolute alcohol consumed (oz) per drinking day across pregnancy, although a trend toward a positive correlation is seen at lower amounts of alcohol consumed. Among the polyunsaturated, long-chain FAEEs, there was weak evidence that the incidence (21.5% vs 6.5%, p=0.057) and concentration (p=0.064) of ethyl arachidonate (AA) were significantly higher in the alcohol-exposed groups than the control groups. Ethyl linolenate and ethyl docosahexanoate (DHA) in meconium were found only in the alcohol group, although not at statistically significant levels. Highly significant correlations were found among the concentrations of ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, ethyl AA, and ethyl DHA in meconium (correlations ranged between rs=0.203, p=0.024; and rs=0.594, p<0.001). Conclusion: We conclude that FAEEs in meconium, particularly ethyl linoleate and ethyl AA, are biomarkers of high specificity for prenatal exposure to alcohol in newborn infants. We also propose that ethyl AA and DHA could be potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol effects on the developing fetal brain and should be investigated further.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters limb development that may lead to structural and functional abnormalities of the limb reported in children diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. To determine whether PAE alters the central representation of the forelimb we used the rodent barrel cortex as our model system where it was possible to visualize and quantitatively measure the size of the forepaw representation in the forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) in first somatosensory cortex. In the present study, we examined the effects of PAE on pattern and size of the forepaw and forepaw representation in FBS in neonatal rats at gestational day 32 that corresponds to postnatal day 9. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically intubated with binge doses of ethanol (6 g/kg) from gestational day 1 through gestational day 20. The offspring of the ethanol treated dams comprised the ethanol (EtOH) group. The effect of PAE on the EtOH group was compared with a nutritional-controlled pairfed (PF) group and a normal chowfed (CF) group. The ventral (glabrous) surface area of the forepaw digits, length of digit 2 through digit 5, and the corresponding glabrous forepaw digit representations in the FBS were measured and compared between treatment groups. In rats exposed to in utero alcohol, the sizes of the overall glabrous forepaw and forepaw digits were significantly reduced in EtOH pups compared to CF and PF pups; overall glabrous forepaw area was 11% smaller than CF controls. Glabrous digit lengths were also smaller in EtOH rats compared to CF controls and significantly smaller in digit 2 through digit 4. The glabrous digit representation in FBS was 18% smaller in the EtOH group when compared to the CF treatment. However, PAE did not produce malformations in the forepaw or alter the pattern of the forepaw representation in FBS; instead, PAE significantly reduced both body and brain weights compared to controls. Unexpectedly, little or no correlation was observed between the size of the glabrous forepaw compared to the size of the glabrous forepaw representation in the FBS for any of the treatment groups. The present findings of PAE-related alterations in sensory periphery and the central cortical representation may underlie deficits in sensorimotor integration reported among children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - Objective: This study investigated whether there were differential effects of substantial prenatal alcohol exposure on letter and category fluency in children. Given that children with prenatal alcohol exposure are often impaired in executive functioning and that letter fluency taxes executive processes more than category fluency, it was expected that children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) would be more impaired in letter than in category fluency. A second objective of the study was to examine the developmental trends in the two types of fluency in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. It was hypothesized that between the ages of 6 and 9 years, these FAS children would show age-related changes in category fluency but not in letter fluency. Method: As part of a neuropsychological test battery designed for an international collaborative study of FAS in South Africa, tests of letter and category fluency were administered in Afrikaans. The participants were 62 children with FAS and 61 controls matched with respect to age, gender (58 boys and 65 girls), ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results: Results showed that the FAS group had relatively greater difficulty with letter fluency than with category fluency and that the FAS group generated fewer words in both fluency conditions. Contrary to the expectation, however, alcohol-affected children demonstrated age-related linear trends in both letter and category fluency. Conclusions: This is the first study of verbal fluency involving a large sample of well-diagnosed children with FAS conducted in a nonwestern environment. The results are nonetheless consistent with those obtained in western countries in studies of children with various levels of prenatal alcohol exposure and various levels of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This study suggests that at least some aspects of the cognitive profile associated with prenatal alcohol exposure may be generalizable across cultural and ethnic boundaries.

N2  - Motor coordination was assessed in two samples of adult subjects: one sample (n = 90) included adults previously diagnosed with one of a number of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and comparison peers, the second was a prospective longitudinal study of adults who were exposed to varying levels of alcohol as fetuses (n = 402). This comparative analysis sought to determine whether motor effects seen in both clinical and nonclinical children persist into adulthood, whether any individual motor tasks show significant effects of prenatal alcohol exposure across the age range, and whether motor assessments of adults have any role in diagnostic strategies for adults suspected of FASD. Motor tests included balance and unilateral, bilateral, finger, hand and foot coordination. Three-quarters of the subjects with FASD demonstrated deficits in motor function outside the range of comparison subjects. Adults with FASD performed more poorly, on average, on all individual tests including balance and fine motor control. In the prospective longitudinal sample, only subjects who had been previously identified in childhood as having a possible diagnosis on the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum were still in deficit as adults on motor tasks, relative to comparison subjects. Thus, the dose-dependent motor coordination effects of alcohol previously found in children do not appear to persist into adulthood, except in those most highly exposed children who also have other accompanying neuropsychological effects in childhood. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The brains of fetal alcohol syndrome patients exhibit impaired neuronal migration, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying this abnormality. Here we show that Ca2+ signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of alcohol action in neuronal cell migration. Acute administration of ethanol reduced the frequency of transient Ca2+ elevations in migrating neurons and cGMP levels and increased cAMP levels. Experimental manipulations of these second-messenger pathways, through stimulating Ca2+ and cGMP signaling or inhibiting cAMP signaling, completely reversed the action of ethanol on neuronal migration in vitro as well as in vivo. Each second messenger has multiple but distinct downstream targets, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, calcineurin, protein phosphatase 1, Rho GTPase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. These results demonstrate that the aberrant migration of immature neurons in the fetal brain caused by maternal alcohol consumption may be corrected by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways.

N2  - We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying self-reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health professionals at the Maipu Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption, and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p = 0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age (p = 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile, clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Inc.

N2  - The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human comprise a spectrum of structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We previously have proposed revisions to the 1996 Institute of Medicine Diagnostic Criteria for diagnoses in the FASD continuum [fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)], allowing for more reproducible and accurate FASD diagnosis in a clinical setting [Hoyme et al, 2005]. The NIAAA recently has coordinated and funded an international consortium of projects aimed at more complete characterization of the teratogenic spectrum of alcohol. One of the projects sites is in Finland. The aims of this project are: (1) to completely clinically characterize the structural and learning/behavioral phenotypes of a large cohort of older children and adolescents with moderate to severe disability within the FASD continuum; (2) to correlate FASD dysmorphology and behavioral phenotypes with CNS structure and function (i.e., MRS, MRI correlations); (3) to compare the phenotype of a genetically homogeneous population of Finnish children with FASD to that observed in other populations. We have recently completed dysmorphology examination and parent/guardian interviews of the 77 children in the Finnish cohort. The purpose of this report is to present historical and morphometric data on these patients, thereby more completely delineating the clinical spectrum of FASD in older children and adolescents, contrasting the phenotype with that described in other populations and examining whether a weighted dysmorphology score could be used as a clinical and research adjunct when fetal alcohol exposure is being suspected. All children were previously diagnosed with FASD by an experienced pediatric specialist in Finland, and all were exposed to significant maternal alcohol abuse prenatally. The sex ratio of the cohort was 0.38 (male: female) and ages ranged from 8 to 20 years, with a mean of 13 years. After application of the Revised IOM Diagnostic Criteria, 53% of the subjects were diagnosed as having FAS, 30% PFAS, 12% ARND, and 5% other diagnoses. Of note, although a family history of mental retardation or birth defects was rare, 43% of the children had one or more sibling who also carried a diagnosis of FAS. Eighty-nine percent of the mothers smoked cigarettes during gestation; other teratogenic exposures were rare. Almost none had undergone genetics evaluation in the past. Almost all of the subjects had resided in multiple foster placements since early childhood and had been followed regularly by pediatric specialists. Although 11% were born prematurely, 70% demonstrated prenatal growth deficiency, and 45% were microcephalic. Other than growth deficits and the cardinal facial features, the most common major and minor anomalies noted were: camptodactyly (55%), "hockey stick" or other altered palmar creases (51%), refractive errors (40%), strabismus (38%), dental crowding (43%), nail hypoplasia (38%), GU anomalies (22%), and congenital heart defects (18%), "Railroad track" ears were not observed in this population. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with learning, behavioral, and academic problems even in children without the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Objective: To examine the prenatal alcohol exposure and ability, academic achievement, and school functioning in adolescence. Methods: In a longitudinal cohort, intelligence, academic performance, and school functioning were evaluated in 265 low socioeconomic status (SES) adolescents (M age = 15.1 years), 128 prenatally exposed to alcohol, 53 controls, and 84 special education students by using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd edition (WISC-III) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT). School records were abstracted for grade point averages (GPA), standardized achievement test scores, conduct, attendance, and special education placement. Results: Alcohol-affected youth had significantly lower IQs than those in the other three groups. Conclusion: Although academic achievement (WIAT scores) was most impaired in the special education group who showed lower performance over all as well as in reading and spelling, alcohol-affected youth showed significant deficits on mathematics subtests. There was no increased incidence of conduct problems in school records related to alcohol exposure. © The Author 2005.

N2  - Alcohol abuse in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranging from discreet developmental problems to fetal alcohol syndrome. That is why pregnant women and the women considering pregnancy should abstain from alcohol. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders occur even after drinking at early stages of pregnancy when women are not aware of being pregnant. According to one study 75% Czech women drank alcohol before pregnancy and one third of them continued during first three months of pregnancy. According to new epidemiological data 83.4% of Czech women aged between 18 and 40 drank alcohol during the year preceeding the pregnancy. The prevention in this area in the Czech Republic is clearly not satisfactory, and it is complicated by the alcohol advertising targeted at women, low taxation of alcohol and other factors.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Elevated levels of fatty acid ethyl esters have been documented in the meconium of neonates born to heavily drinking mothers. Recently, accumulation of FAEE has been documented in the hair of drinking adults. To be able to use this test in the diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, one needs to establish baseline FAEE levels in infants born to nonalcoholic women because ethanol occurs in the baby naturally even without drinking. Scalp hair of 56 infants born to nonalcoholic women attending a well-baby clinic was obtained. Levels of FAEE were measured by GC-MS. FAEE were detected in almost all hair samples. Offspring of women admitting to mild, infrequent drinking did not differ in FAEE hair levels from infants of total abstainers. Baseline levels of FAEE in neonatal hair of nonalcoholic mothers have been established. Mild infrequent maternal drinking does not elevate these baseline levels. This may help avoid false-positive determinations when assessing infants born to problem drinking mothers.

T1  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy
A1  - Krulewitch C.J.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Alcohol is a potent teratogen in humans, and prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) refers to a pattern of birth defects found in children of mothers who drank during pregnancy. FAS has four criteria: maternal drinking during pregnancy, a characteristic pattern of facial abnormalities, growth retardation, and brain damage (often manifested by intellectual difficulties or behavioral problems). As surveillance and research have progressed, it has become clear that FAS is but a rare example of a wide array of defects that can occur from exposure to alcohol in utero. At least 1 in 10 women will continue to consume alcohol during pregnancy, putting their fetuses at risk for the effects of alcohol exposure. Nurses are in a key position to provide care and conduct research that will contribute to the prevention of the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure during the preconception and perinatal periods, as well as deal with the negative outcomes of exposure in the developing infant. Many areas have yet to be evaluated. Screening tools and interventions have been developed and tested, mostly in majority cultures. Culturally sensitive instruments must be generated and validated for high-risk groups such as Native Americans. Fetal alcohol biomarkers and genetic research are new and need considerably more work. Effective "no drinking during pregnancy" campaigns for high-risk groups must be created and tested. Nurses are well placed to conduct research that will describe the effects at social, behavioral, and biological levels; develop middle-range theories targeted at preventing the drinking behavior and optimizing care of affected children after birth; and generate and test effective interventions that enhance prevention strategies in the 21st century.

T1  - Guidelines for identifying and referring persons with fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Bertrand J.
A1  - Floyd L.L.
A1  - Weber M.K.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) results from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and carries lifelong consequences. Early recognition of FAS can result in better outcomes for persons who receive a diagnosis. Although FAS was first identified in 1973, persons with this condition often do not receive a diagnosis. In 2002, Congress directed CDC to update and refine diagnostic and referral criteria for FAS, incorporating recent scientific and clinical evidence. In 2002, CDC convened a scientific working group (SWG) of persons with expertise in FAS research, diagnosis, and treatment to draft criteria for diagnosing FAS. This report summarizes the diagnostic guidelines drafted by the SWG, provides recommendations for when and how to refer a person suspected of having problems related to prenatal alcohol exposure, and assesses existing practices for creating supportive environments that might prevent long-term adverse consequences associated with FAS. The guidelines were created on the basis of a review of scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and the experiences of families affected by FAS regarding the physical and neuropsychologic features of FAS and the medical, educational, and social services needed by persons with FAS and their families. The guidelines are intended to facilitate early identification of persons affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol so they and their families can receive services that enable them to achieve healthy lives and reach their full potential. This report also includes recommendations to enhance identification of and intervention for women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Additional data are needed to develop diagnostic criteria for other related disorders (e.g., alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder).

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - QUESTION: By the time women find out they are pregnant and see a family physician, they might have already consumed alcohol during the pregnancy and affected the development of their fetuses. How can family physicians better prevent exposure to alcohol during pregnancy? ANSWER: Women of childbearing age should be counseled about the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy before they become pregnant. Diagnosing children who have fetal alcohol spectrum disorders can help identify birth mothers who are at risk of other alcohol-exposed pregnancies and who need support to change their behaviour.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to examine fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among Japanese children of alcoholic mothers. This is the first report concerning FASD in Japan. METHODS: The subjects were 30 alcoholic women who were inpatients in the Kurihama Alcoholism Center and had given birth to children. They were subjected to a semi-structured interview by the author. Sixty healthy women who had not drunk during pregnancy were used as a control group, and they also underwent semi-structured interviews. The alcoholic women were divided into two groups, 13 who drunk during pregnancies and 17 who did not drink. Twenty children experienced of prenatal alcohol exposure and 40 children did not. The three groups; i.e., 13 alcoholic mothers who had drunk during pregnancy and their 20 children (ALD group), 17 alcoholic mothers who had not drunk during pregnancy and their 40 children (ALND group) and 60 non-alcoholic control mothers and their 80 children (Control group), were compared concerning the mothers' drinking problems and abnormal deliveries, children's birth weights, congenital abnormalities, abnormalities of the central nervous system and psychological problems. RESULTS: The mean age of onset of problem drinking of the mothers in the ALD group was significantly lower than that in the mothers of the ALND group, and some of the mothers in the ALD group showed alcohol dependence before their pregnancies. The mean birth weights of the children of the ALD group, ALND group and Control group were 2816 g, 3128 g and 3142 g, respectively and the differences were significant. The children of the ALD group had significantly more abnormal birth episodes, developmental retardation and psychiatric symptoms than those in the other two groups. Among 20 children in the ALD group, FASD was suspected in 6 children (10% of the children of alcoholic mothers). Six children had low birth weights, abnormal birth episodes, mental retardation and psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: One third of the Japanese children of alcoholic mothers had experiences of prenatal alcohol exposure and 10% of them had suspected FASD abnormalities.

T1  - The neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Welch-Carre E.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - During pregnancy, ingestion of alcohol, a known teratogen, can cause harm to the fetus. Prenatal alcohol exposure is one of the leading causes of birth defects, developmental disorders, and mental retardation in children. The fetal central nervous system is particularly vulnerable to alcohol; this vulnerability contributes to many of the long-term disabilities and disorders seen in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure. Diagnoses associated with prenatal alcohol exposure include fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and alcohol-related birth defects. Once diagnosed, early intervention improves the long-term outcome of affected children. Without documentation of maternal alcohol use, a diagnosis, and consequently treatment, is often difficult to attain. It is imperative that nurses, physicians, and other healthcare providers become comfortable with obtaining a history of, and providing anticipatory guidance and counseling about, alcohol use.

N2  - PURPOSE: The incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is increasing, even though it is 100% preventable. This study examined use of, knowledge about, and attitudes toward alcohol of women requesting emergency contraception (EC) and/or a pregnancy test, and evaluated whether a brief intervention would be effective in educating them about the risks of FASD. DATA SOURCES: Fifty women from two outpatient clinics participated. Information was collected on demographic and personal health habits, alcohol use, and knowledge of and attitudes toward alcohol. As a brief intervention to increase knowledge about FASD, participants read a short pamphlet about the risks of alcohol exposure in pregnancy and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and skewness, were calculated for all variables. Pearson correlations were computed to assess relationships between demographic/lifestyle variables and attitudes toward and knowledge about alcohol. Paired t-tests were used to analyze the relationship between pretest and post-test knowledge scores. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants were single (76%), college educated (94%), and received EC at the clinic visit (60%). The average age was 24 years. Slightly over half (52%) reported drinking beer at least once a week, with one to six cans on occasion. Younger women expressed more tolerant attitudes toward alcohol use (p= .02) and drank significantly more beer on occasion (p= .015). Women who reported drinking alcohol when they last had sex were significantly (p= .017) less tolerant in their attitudes toward alcohol use. The intervention used in this study was effective in communicating knowledge about FASD to this population (p < .0001). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings suggest that young women may be engaging in behaviors that could put potential offspring at risk for exposure to alcohol. Clinicians are advised to take a thorough history to determine alcohol use in all women of childbearing age and to provide information regarding FASD prevention.

N2  - Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy may result in facial dysmorphism, growth retardation and central nervous system deficits. This has been found in infants ranging from fetal alcohol effects (FAE) to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), or alcohol related neurodevelopment disorders (ARND) and alcohol related birth defects (ARBD). In this study, we report a FAE case with orofacial cleft due to mother's alcohol use during her pregnancy. A 32-year-old Japanese woman, para2, gravida3. She was drinking alcohol while this pregnancy. At 39th week, a girl was delivered vaginally. Her birth weight is 3860gr. Apgar score is seven points at one minutes and eight points at 10 minutes. Orofacial cleft and sinus tachycardia were diagnosed postnatally. From a brain-computed tomography (CTscan), it showed a normal finding. Karyotype was normal female phenotype (46, XX). It is important to note that the obstetrician had to advise the women not to have alcohol use during pregnancy in order to prevent her baby from fetal alcohol effects or toxic effect of alcohol on the fetus.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The first descriptions in the modern medical literature of a distinctly recognizable pattern of malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse were reported in 1968 and 1973. Since that time, substantial progress has been made in developing specific criteria for defining and diagnosing this condition. Two sets of diagnostic criteria are now used most widely for evaluation of children with potential diagnoses in the FASD continuum, ie, the 1996 Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria and the Washington criteria. Although both approaches have improved the clinical delineation of FASD, both suffer from significant drawbacks in their practical application in pediatric practice. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to present specific clarifications of the 1996 IOM criteria for the diagnosis of FASD, to facilitate their practical application in clinical pediatric practice. METHODS: A large cohort of children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol were identified, through active case-ascertainment methods, in 6 Native American communities in the United States and 1 community in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The children and their families underwent standardized multidisciplinary evaluations, including a dysmorphology examination, developmental and neuropsychologic testing, and a structured maternal interview, which gathered data about prenatal drinking practices and other demographic and family information. Data for these subjects were analyzed, and revisions and clarifications of the existing IOM FASD diagnostic categories were formulated on the basis of the results. RESULTS: The revised IOM method defined accurately and completely the spectrum of disabilities among the children in our study. On the basis of this experience, we propose specific diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome and partial fetal alcohol syndrome. We also define alcohol-related birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder from a practical standpoint. CONCLUSIONS: The 1996 IOM criteria remain the most appropriate diagnostic approach for children prenatally exposed to alcohol. The proposed revisions presented here make these criteria applicable in clinical pediatric practice.

N2  - Elevated levels of fatty acid ethyl esters have been documented in the meconium of neonates born to heavily drinking mothers. Recently, accumulation of FAEE has been documented in the hair of drinking adults. To be able to use this test in the diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, one needs to establish baseline FAEE levels in infants born to nonalcoholic women because ethanol occurs in the baby naturally even without drinking. Scalp hair of 56 infants born to nonalcoholic women attending a well-baby clinic was obtained. Levels of FAEE were measured by GC-MS. FAEE were detected in almost all hair samples. Offspring of women admitting to mild, infrequent drinking did not differ in FAEE hair levels from infants of total abstainers. Baseline levels of FAEE in neonatal hair of nonalcoholic mothers have been established. Mild infrequent maternal drinking does not elevate these baseline levels. This may help avoid false-positive determinations when assessing infants born to problem drinking mothers. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Alcohol abuse is common among the population and results in significant diseases that shorten life span. Ethanol may result in chronic brain changes such as atrophy but may also result in neurologic disease that may be acute or chronic and sometimes life threatening. Accompanying vitamin deficiencies may lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy and changes in serum osmosis may lead to several acute demyelinating disorders. In addition, pregnant women who consume alcohol place their babies at high risk for the fetal alcohol syndrome. In this article we review these disorders and emphasize their imaging features.

N2  - Background. The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The first descriptions in the modern medical literature of a distinctly recognizable pattern of malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse were reported in 1968 and 1973. Since that time, substantial progress has been made in developing specific criteria for defining and diagnosing this condition. Two sets of diagnostic criteria are now used most widely for evaluation of children with potential diagnoses in the FASD continuum, ie, the 1996 Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria and the Washington criteria. Although both approaches have improved the clinical delineation of FASD, both suffer from significant drawbacks in their practical application in pediatric practice. Objective. The purpose of this report is to present specific clarifications of the 1996 IOM criteria for the diagnosis of FASD, to facilitate their practical application in clinical pediatric practice. Methods. A large cohort of children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol were identified, through active case-ascertainment methods, in 6 Native American communities in the United States and 1 community in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The children and their families underwent standardized multidisciplinary evaluations, including a dysmorphology examination, developmental and neuropsychologic testing, and a structured maternal interview, which gathered data about prenatal drinking practices and other demographic and family information.

N2  - Background: Due to changing cultural norms, Latinas of childbearing age residing in the U.S. may be at increasing risk of drinking harmful levels of alcohol during pregnancy, and may also be unaware of the risks for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders associated with this behavior. We assessed the prevalence of alcohol consumption in a sample of low-income pregnant Latinas and examined risk factors for alcohol use in the periconceptional period. Methods: As part of a larger intervention trial, a cross-sectional in-home interview study was conducted among a sample of 100 pregnant low-income Latinas receiving services from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in San Diego County, California. Results: Fifty-seven percent of respondents indicated they were either life-time abstainers or had not consumed any alcohol in the periconceptional period. Forty-three percent reported some alcohol use in the three months prior to recognition of the current pregnancy, and 20% reported at least one binge episode of four or more standard drinks during that time frame. Five percent reported drinking seven or more drinks per week, and 8% continued drinking alcohol after recognition of pregnancy. Significant predictors of any alcohol use in the periconceptional period included English language/higher level of acculturation, younger maternal age, lower parity, higher level of education, younger age at first drink, and having ever smoked. Women who were aware of alcohol warning messages and /or had more knowledge of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) were significantly more likely to have consumed alcohol in the periconceptional period. Frequency of periconceptional use of alcohol did not differ between women who planned or did not plan the pregnancy. Conclusion: The prevalence and pattern of early pregnancy alcohol consumption in this sample of Latinas is similar to patterns noted in other race/ethnic groups in the U.S. Level of knowledge about FAS and awareness of warning messages was not protective for early pregnancy alcohol consumption, suggesting that specific knowledge was insufficient to prevent exposure or that other factors reinforce maintenance of alcohol consumption in early pregnancy. Selective interventions in low-income Latinas are warranted, and should be focused on women of reproductive age who are binge or frequent drinkers and who are at risk of becoming pregnant.

N2  - Alcohol drinking during pregnancy results in abnormal fetal development, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in humans and experimental animals. FAS is characterized by two major effects, including central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and multiple anomalies recognizable mainly as a typical face. However, the mechanisms of alcohol-induced embryotoxicity have not been clearly demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced FAS in the developing embryo. First, ethanol-induced developmental abnormalities were investigated in vitro. Postimplantation embryos at gestation day (GD) 9.5 were cultured for 48 h and observed for morphological changes. Ethanol-mediated changes in proteins regulated apoptosis (p53 and bcl-2), antioxidant (vitamin E and catalase) activities, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative DNA damage shown as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-O HdG) were measured in embryonic midbrain cells. Alcohol or acetaldehyde significantly induced cytotoxicity in cultured rat embryonic midbrain cells. The levels of p53, bcl-2, and 8-O HdG were concomitantly changed by alcohol and acetaldehyde treatment in midbrain cells. Injured cells induced by ROS were increased by alcohol or acetaldehyde treatment in midbrain cells. Cotreatment with alcohol or acetaldehyde and catalase decreased cytotoxicity in midbrain cells. In postimplantation embryo culture, alcohol or acetaldehyde-treated embryos showed retardation of embryonic growth and development in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that alcohol and its metabolite acetaldehyde induce fetal developmental abnormalities by disrupting cellular differentiation and growth. Data demonstrate that some antioxidants can partially protect against the alcohol-induced embryonic developmental toxicity. Copyright© Taylor & Francis Inc.

N2  - Factors that change sex hormone levels during pregnancy may have long-term health consequences for the offspring, including changes in breast cancer risk. A cross-sectional analysis of alcohol consumption and hormone levels in 339 pregnant women sampled from the Child Health and Development Study cohort was undertaken. Alcohol intake was queried from 1959 to 1966, long before any hazards of drinking during pregnancy were publicized. Third trimester serum hormone levels including estradiol and testosterone were analyzed. Among 339 pregnant women, 196 reported some alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The drinkers were divided into three groups with intake levels of 0.2-0.5, 0.6-2.0, and 2.1-12.5 ounces of ethanol per week. The second group corresponds to a median intake of ~2 drinks per week, and the last group corresponds to a median intake of ~1 drink per day, which is considered "light" to "moderate" drinking. Maternal estradiol levels were not associated with alcohol intake during pregnancy. However, serum testosterone was significantly lower, by 12.2%, in the latter two groups of drinking pregnant women, [confidence interval (CI) = -3.0 to 25.2] and 25.6% (CI = 9.2-39.5), respectively. The alcohol intakes reported are far below those shown to cause fetal alcohol syndrome, or any of the fetal alcohol effects so far studied. Light alcohol intake during pregnancy is associated with lower maternal testosterone. The health implications are uncertain, but may include an increased breast density in the daughters of drinking mothers. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Alcohol use among women of childbearing age is prevalent in the United States, with approximately 1 in 5 non-pregnant women reporting binge drinking (5 or more drinks on any one occasion) and 1 in 25 pregnant women reporting binge drinking. Alcohol use during pregnancy results in a spectrum of adverse outcomes known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of these disorders. Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by specific facial abnormalities and significant impairments in neurodevelopment and physical growth. Early identification of children with FAS has been shown to enhance their long-term outcomes. In an effort to improve clinical recognition of children with this condition, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was directed by Congress in 2002 to lead the development of uniform diagnostic criteria for FAS and other prenatal alcohol-related conditions. The purpose of this commentary is to provide clinicians a summary of the report released by CDC describing the current diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, advancements have been made in screening and brief interventions for alcohol use disorders in women who have the potential to make significant strides in the prevention of FAS spectrum disorders. Knowledge of the diagnostic criteria for FAS can lead to increased identification of the syndrome in infants and children and the provision of appropriate medical and support services. Screening for and intervening with women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy can prevent FAS and other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2005 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Children prenatally exposed to alcohol typically exhibit behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity, learning deficits, and an increased prevalence of depression. Similar impairments are found in children of hypothyroid mothers, and we have shown that alcohol-consuming rat dams have suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) function. Therefore, we hypothesized that suppressed maternal thyroid hormonal milieu may contribute to the deleterious consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. We aimed first to confirm and then to reverse the behavioral deficits in the fetal alcohol exposed (FAE) rat offspring by administration of thyroxine (T4) to the alcohol-consuming dams. Adult offspring prenatally exposed to ethanol (FAE; 35% ethanol-derived calories), pair-fed (PF) or control (C) diets were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM), the forced swim test (FST), and the open field test (OFT) to assess spatial learning, depressive behavior, and exploratory behavior/anxiety, respectively. Adult FAE offspring took longer to locate a hidden platform in the MWM and showed increased depressive behavior in the FST both of which were reversed by administration of T4 to the alcohol-consuming mother. We found sex and brain region-specific alterations in expression of genes involved in these behaviors in FAE adult offspring. Specifically, decreased hippocampal GAP-43 mRNA levels in adult FAE females and decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the amygdala of male and female FAE offspring were observed. The decreased mRNA levels of GAP-43 and GR were normalized by T4 treatment to the alcohol-consuming mother. Our results suggest that the suppressed HPT function of the alcohol-consuming mother contributes to the behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions observed in the offspring. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

N2  - Alcohol abuse in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranging from discreet developmental problems to fetal alcohol syndrome. That is why pregnant women and the women considering pregnancy should abstain from alcohol. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders occur even after drinking at early stages of pregnancy when women are not aware of being pregnant. According to one study 75% Czech women drank alcohol before pregnancy and one third of them continued during first three months of pregnancy. According to new epidemiological data 83,4 % of Czech women aged between 18 and 40 drank alcohol during the year preceeding the pregnancy. The prevention in this area in the Czech Republic is clearly not satisfactory, and it is complicated by the alcohol advertising targeted at women, low taxation of alcohol and other factors.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a second primary school cohort in a community in South Africa. Method: Active case ascertainment, two-tier screening, and Institute of Medicine assessment methodology were employed among 857 first grade pupils, most born in 1993. Characteristics of children with FAS were contrasted with characteristics of a randomly selected control group from the same classrooms. Physical growth and development, dysmorphology and psychological characteristics of the children and measures of maternal alcohol use and smoking were analyzed. Results: The rate of FAS found in this study is the highest yet reported in any overall community in the world, 65.2-74.2 per 1,000 children in the first grade population. These rates are 33-148 times greater than U.S. estimates and higher than in a previous cohort study in this same community (40.5-46.4 per 1,000). Detailed documentation of physical features indicates that FAS children in South Africa have characteristics similar to those elsewhere: poor growth and development, facial and limb dysmorphology, and lower intellectual functioning. Frequent, severe episodic drinking of beer and wine is common among mothers and fathers of FAS children. Their lives are characterized by serious familial, social and economic challenges, compared with controls. Heavy episodic maternal drinking is significantly associated with negative outcomes of children in the area of non-verbal intelligence but even more so in verbal intelligence, behavior and overall dysmorphology (physical anomalies). Significantly more FAS exists among children of women who were rural residents (odds ratio: 7.36, 95% confidence interval: 3.31-16.52), usually among workers on local farms. Conclusion: A high rate of FAS was documented in this community. Given social and economic similarities and racial admixture, we suspect that other communities in the Western Cape have rates that also are quite high.

N2  - Background: Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure can cause impairments even in the absence of gross morphological defects associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. The basal ganglia, which include the dopamine-rich striatum, are sensitive to fetal alcohol-induced injury. In this study, we manipulated the timing of moderate-level alcohol exposure and compared the risk of adverse effects on striatal dopamine (DA) system function in rhesus monkeys. Methods: Thirty-five young adult rhesus monkeys (Macaco mulatta) from four groups of females were assessed: (1) an early alcohol-exposed group (n = 9), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6 g/kg alcohol solution on gestational days O through 50; (2) a middle-to-late gestation alcohol-exposed group (n = 7), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6 g/kg alcohol solution on gestational days 50 through 135; (3) a continuous-exposure group (n = 9), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6 g/kg alcohol solution on days O through 135; and (4) controls (n = 10), in which mothers voluntarily consumed an isocaloric control solution on gestational days O through 50,50 through 135, or 0 through 135. We studied striatal DA system function by positron emission tomography in separate scans for trapping of [18F]fallypride and 6-[18F]fluoro-m- tyrosine to assess striatal DA D2 receptor (D2R) binding and DA synthesis, respectively, via dopadecarboxylase activity. Results: Moderate-level alcohol exposure during early gestation and continuous exposure throughout gestation (early + middle-to-late exposure) reduced the striatal D2R binding to DA synthesis ratio, whereas middle-to-late alcohol gestation exposure increased the striatal D2R binding to DA synthesis ratio. The continuous-exposure group showed the largest effect. Moreover, the D2R binding/DA synthesis ratio was related to neonatal neurobehavior measures in control monkeys, but these relationships were disrupted in the fetal alcohol-exposed monkeys. Conclusion: These results suggest that the vulnerability of the DA system to the effects of moderate doses of alcohol during gestation depend on the timing of the alcohol exposure. Early-gestation moderate alcohol exposure resulted in a reduction or blunting of dopaminergic function in adulthood, whereas middle to late exposure (without early exposure) either induced the opposite pattern or heightened dopaminergic function. Continuously exposed monkeys showed the largest effect, suggesting that the sooner women stop drinking, the better it is for the fetus. Copyright © 2005 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objective: Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders are contributors to long-term learning disabilities. By using a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, we have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure results in adult learning deficits of unknown mechanisms. In the developing hippocampus, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2B triggers long-term potentiation, fundamental to learning and memory; this is supplemented by the less plastic NR2A subunit in the adult. To understand the mechanism of learning deficits in FAS, we evaluated NR2B and NR2A expression in embryonic and adult mice. Study design: Pregnant C57Bl6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol or control (saline solution). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 10 days, and brains from adult offspring were collected at 3 months (after evaluation for learning deficit). Calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for NR2B and NR2A with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance. Results: At 6 hours, NR2B expression in the alcohol-exposed embryos was higher than in controls (P < .01). NR2A was not expressed in either group. By 24 hours there was no difference in NR2B (P = .3). However, at 10 days NR2B was lower in alcohol-exposed animals (P = .02). In the adult brains there was a relative decrease in NR2B (P = .03) and an increase in NR2A (P < .01). Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure during development induces NR2B expression deregulation in the embryos that persists until adulthood, when a relative increase in the less modifiable subunit NR2A occurs. This alteration in NMDA receptor subunits may underlie the learning abnormalities in fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Question: By the time women find out they are pregnant and see a family physician, they might have already consumed alcohol during the pregnancy and affected the development of their fetuses. How can family physicians better prevent exposure to alcohol during pregnancy? Answer: Women of childbearing age should be counseled about the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy before they become pregnant. Diagnosing children who have fetal alcohol spectrum disorders can help identify birth mothers who are at risk of other alcohol-exposed pregnancies and who need support to change their behaviour.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure results in fetal death and neurobehavioral complications including learning impairment. Previously synthetic peptides derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor have been shown to prevent aspects of alcohol-induced damage in pregnancy. The objective of this work was to evaluate whether activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 could prevent alcohol-induced damage in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Study design: Using a well-characterized model, C57Bl6/J mice on gestational day 8 were treated with placebo, alcohol (30% volume/volume alcohol 0.03 mL/kg), alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 30 minutes prior to alcohol, or activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 alone. Fetal death was assessed on gestational day 18 (25 litters were evaluated: alcohol, n = 5; placebo, n = 9; alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12, n = 11). Neonatal behavior tests were performed on postnatal days 1 through 21 with the offspring of 12 dams (alcohol, n = 16; placebo, n = 46; alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12, n = 23; and activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12, n = 35). Adult males were tested in the Morris water maze for learning assessment and with the hole punch activity test for exploratory activity. Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis and analysis of variance. Results: Fetal death was greater in alcohol (67% +/- 13%) vs placebo (8.4% +/- 3%, P<.001). Pretreatment with activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death (2.2% +/- 8.1%) with levels similar to control (P = .12). Alcohol exposure caused a delay in achieving developmental milestones, with alcohol achieving milestones later than all other groups (all P<.001). Pretreatment with activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 prevented the alcohol-induced milestone delays. In the Morris water maze, the placebo learned, decreasing their latency to find the hidden platform over 70% (P<.01). Alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 also significantly learned, with a learning curve not different from placebo (all P>.5) and significantly better than alcohol on days 4, 6, and 7 (all P<.05). Alcohol exposure resulted in significantly less time in hole punch activity (P<.02) than control. Activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 pretreatment prevented the alcohol-induced decline, with levels the same as control (P = .1). Conclusion: The novel peptide activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 prevents alcohol-induced fetal death and developmental and learning abnormalities in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. This demonstrates that a single treatment with a peptide is efficacious and may be of value in the prevention of alcohol-induced damage. © 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Executive functioning and working memory in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
A1  - Rasmussen C.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The goal of this report is to critically review research on executive functioning (EF) and working memory in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Individuals with FASD exhibit EF deficits in the areas of cognitive flexibility, planning and strategy use, verbal reasoning, some aspects of inhibition, set shifting, fluency, working memory, and, recently, on tests of emotion-related or hot EF. Some researchers have linked prenatal alcohol exposure to abnormalities in the development of the frontal cortex of affected individuals or animals. One common finding is that these EF deficits persist regardless of whether the individual has facial dysmorphology. Furthermore, EF deficits are not simply due to a low IQ in these individuals. More research with larger sample sizes, smaller age ranges, and consistent measurement tools is needed in this area to ameliorate some inconsistencies in the literature. Furthermore, researchers should now focus on studying the pattern of weakness in EF in individuals with FASD as well as relations among working memory and EF, which will help to identify specific areas of weakness, to enhance diagnosis, and to improve treatment. There is limited research on the development of EF in individuals with FASD, which can have important implications for understanding of how these deficits unfold from childhood through adulthood.

N2  - Maternal alcohol exposure results in a variety of neurodevelopmental abnormalities that include cognitive and sensorimotor dysfunctions that often persist into adulthood. Many reports of central nervous system disturbances associated within a clinical diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome point toward disturbances in central information processing. In this study, we used the rat barrel field cortex as a model system to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the organization and size of the large whisker representation in layer IV of the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF) in somatosensory cortex. Pregnant rats (Sprague-Dawley) were intragastrically gavaged daily with alcohol doses (6 gm/kg body weight) from gestational day 1 to day 20 in a chronic binge pattern which produced blood alcohol levels ranging between 260 mg/dl and 324 mg/dl. Chow-fed (CF), pair-fed (PF), and cross-foster (XF) groups served as normal, nutritionally matched, and maternal controls, respectively, for the ethanol-exposed (EtOH) treatment group. All pups were examined on gestational day 32 corresponding approximately to postnatal day 9. EtOH and control group pups were weighed, anesthetized, and perfused. Brains were removed and weighed, with and without cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, and the neocortex was removed and weighed. Cortices were then flattened, sectioned tangentially, and stained with a metabolic marker-cytochrome oxidase-to reveal the barrel field. A subset of 27 cortical barrels, associated with the representation of the large whisker pad, was selected to examine in detail. The major results were: (i) the total barrel field area comprising the PMBSF was significantly reduced in EtOH (by 17%) and XF (by 16%) pups compared with CF pups, (ii) the sizes of individual barrels within the PMBSF were also significantly reduced in EtOH (16%) and XF (18%) pups, (iii) the septal region between barrels was also significantly reduced in EtOH (18%) and XF (12%) pups, (iv) anteriorly located barrels underwent greater reduction in size relative to the posteriorly located barrels, (v) body weights were also significantly reduced in EtOH (21%) and XF (27%) pups, (vi) total brain weight [with and without (forebrain) cerebellum/olfactory bulbs] and cortical weights were also significantly reduced in EtOH (total brain weight 15%, forebrain weight 16%, cortical weight 15%) and XF (18%, 19%, 20%) pups, and in contrast (vi) neither the overall barrel field pattern nor the pattern of individual barrels in the PMBSF was altered. These findings suggest that PAE reduces body and brain weight as well as the central cortical representation of the whisker pad, while leaving the overall barrel field pattern unperturbed. While these results might appear to support a miniaturization hypothesis (smaller PMBSF, smaller brain, smaller body weight), PAE also shows regional vulnerability within the PMBSF whereby anteriorly located barrels are most affected. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Objective: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with cognitive, behavioral and social deficits, including delinquency. Although delinquent populations and those with intellectual and behavioral deficits exhibit impaired moral judgment and reasoning, this area remains unexplored in alcohol-exposed individuals. Method: Moral maturity and delinquency were evaluated in 27 participants with prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC group) and 29 nonexposed controls (CON group) matched on age (range: 10-18), gender, handedness, socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Moral maturity was evaluated using the Sociomoral Reflection Measure-Short Form, and delinquency was evaluated with the Conduct Disorder (CD) Questionnaire. Additional measures included social desirability and inhibition. Results: The ALC group performed at a lower level of moral maturity than the CON group. Whereas Verbal IQ primarily predicted this difference, a deficit on the moral value judgment having to do with relationships with others was specific to prenatal alcohol exposure. Furthermore, delinquency was higher in the ALC group, and specific sociomoral values were predictive of delinquent behavior. Finally, half of the children and adolescents with a history of prenatal alcohol exposure but without fetal alcohol syndrome had probable CD. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that interventions aimed at reducing delinquency in those with prenatal alcohol exposure are necessary, and targeting moral judgment for this purpose may be beneficial.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and associated disorders resulting from maternal alcohol use during gestation are among the most common developmental disorders. However, they are rarely diagnosed and not fully understood in terms of their behavioral and neurocognitive phenorype. Prenatal exposure leads to alterations in facial morphology, growth, and neurocognition. The nature and extent of teratogenic effects on the brain and the relationship between such effects and observed behaviors remain in debate because there are no established markers for the neurological effects of exposure. In this study, we examined the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on white-matter integrity in the corpus callosum by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and herein describe the relationship between such effects and observed physical and behavioral outcomes. Methods: DTI was used to evaluate diffusion anisotropy in the genu and splenium of corpus callosum in 16 low-income, primarily African-American volunteers. Volunteers were recruited from a cohort of young adults who had received neuropsychological evaluations during adolescence. Nine had been prenatally exposed to alcohol and had characteristics of FAS, and seven were nonexposed controls. Results: Significant difference in the means for diffusion fractional anisotropy (t = 2.26, df = 9, p < 0.002) and apparent diffusion coefficient (t = 2.14, df = 14, p < 0.008) were observed in the corpus callosum of alcohol-exposed youth compared with nonexposed youth. No significant differences were found in intracranial volume between these groups. Conclusions: Our results illustrate that DTI can be used in evaluating the integrity of corpus callosum in alcohol-exposed individuals. If future studies support these findings, diffusion anisotropy, represented by fractional anisotropy, has the potential to be used as a clinical marker in the diagnosis of FAS.

N2  - Background: Since chronic alcohol use suppresses the adult immune system, we tested the hypothesis that maternal alcohol ingestion increases the risk of infection in term newborns. Methods: Analysis of a large case-control study of birth weight for gestational age was performed focusing on maternal alcohol ingestion and the development of infection in term newborns > 36 weeks gestation. After delivery, mothers were asked about alcohol and tobacco use in the 3 months prior to conception, the 1st, 2nd, and 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. Results: Eight hundred and seventy-two singleton newborns (872) > 36 weeks gestation were identified for analysis. A total of 51 (5.8%) had newborn infections. Gestational age, sex, and small for gestational age (SGA) were similar in the newborns with and without infection (p = NS). Infants whose mothers reported alcohol use, excessive drinking or smoking in pregnancy were more likely to have a newborn diagnosed with an infection than were mothers who reported abstaining from alcohol or cigarettes (p < 0.05). When controlling for race and smoking, SGA infants whose mothers used any alcohol had a 2.5-fold increase risk of infection, while excessive alcohol use increased the risk 3-4-fold. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for low maternal income, smoking, and SGA, excessive alcohol use during the 2nd trimester increased the risk of newborn infection (OR 3.7 [1.1,12.8], p < 0.05). Conclusions: Excessive maternal alcohol use is associated with an increased risk of newborn infection in this patient sample. Increased awareness and further clinical investigations are warranted to address the detrimental effects of fetal alcohol exposure on the developing immune system.

N2  - Objectives. We defined risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a region with the highest documented prevalence of FAS in the world. Methods. We compared mothers of 53 first-grade students with FAS (cases) with 116 randomly selected mothers of first-grade students without FAS (controls). Results. Differences between case and control mothers in our study population existed regarding socioeconomic status, religiosity, education, gravidity, parity, and marital status. Mothers of children with FAS came from alcohol-abusing families in which heavy drinking was almost universal; control mothers drank little to no alcohol. Current and past alcohol use by case mothers was characterized by heavy binge drinking on weekends, with no reduction of use during pregnancy in 87% of the mothers. Twenty percent of control mothers drank during pregnancy, a rate that declined to 12.7% by the third trimester. The percentage who smoked during pregnancy was higher for case mothers than for control mothers (75.5% vs 30.3%), but the number of cigarettes smoked was low among case mothers. The incidence of FAS in offspring of relatively young women (28 years) was not explained by early drinking onset or years of drinking (mean, 7.6 years among case mothers). In addition to traditional FAS risk factors, case mothers were smaller in height, weight, head circumference, and body mass index, all anthropomorphic measures that indicate poor nutrition and second-generation fetal alcohol exposure. Conclusions. Preventive interventions are needed to address maternal risk factors for FAS.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Clinical reports indicate a poor quality of life (QOL) among individuals with FASD; however, QOL has not been formally assessed and reported in this population. We describe psychosocial and QOL assessment scores among 11 women with FASD. These women had poor QOL scores and high levels of mental health disorders and behavioral problems relative to standardization samples and other at-risk populations. We suggest that psychiatric distress may play a substantial role in the reduced quality of life reported among adults with FASD.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: An overview with emphasis on changes in brain and behavior
A1  - Riley E.P.
A1  - McGee C.L.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders constitute a major public health problem. This article presents an overview of important issues that surround these disorders and emphasizes the structural and neurobehavioral consequences associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol. Diagnostic criteria are discussed, and possible moderating factors for the range of outcomes are mentioned. In addition, the prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is described, and estimates of the financial impact of these disorders are given. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure can severely affect the physical and neurobehavioral development of a child. Autopsy and brain imaging studies indicate reductions and abnormalities in overall brain size and shape, specifically in structures such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. A wide range of neuropsychological deficits have been found in children prenatally exposed to alcohol, including deficits in visuospatial functioning, verbal and nonverbal learning, attention, and executive functioning. These children also exhibit a variety of behavioral problems that can further affect their daily functioning. Children exposed to alcohol prenatally, with and without the physical features of fetal alcohol syndrome, display qualitatively similar deficits. Determining the behavioral phenotypes that result from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is critical, because the identification of these children is crucial for early interventions. In addition, knowing which brain areas are involved might enable the development of better intervention strategies. However, intervention needs to go beyond the affected individual to prevent future cases. As evidenced by the staggering financial impact these disorders have on society, prevention efforts need to be aimed at high-risk groups, and this issue needs to be made a high priority in terms of public health.

N2  - Background: Alcohol exposure during the fetal stage generates variable severity in different organs, as seen in fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect. Whether genetic factors or conditions of alcohol exposure influence the susceptibility to alcohol-related developmental impairment remains a question. Methods: To investigate the contribution of genotype to the susceptibility to alcohol-induced toxicity during development beyond confounding maternal factors and variables of alcohol exposures, the authors tested the effect of alcohol exposure under definitive concentration using a whole embryonic culture of two inbred strains previously known to be vulnerable (C57BL/6 [C6]) or resistant (DBA/2 [D2]) to alcohol. On gestational day 8, embryos from each group bearing three to six somites were collected and then cultured for 44 hr in a medium added with 400 mg/dl of ethanol. The viability and morphological malformations, as well as developmental staging of the embryos, were all scored at the end of the culture. Results: The authors found, in contrast to previous reports, that alcohol treatment retarded embryonic growth and induced abnormalities, including the neural tube opening and the hypoplasia of the optic vesicle in both strains. However, alcohol specifically compromised the heart and caudal neural tube in C6, whereas it specifically decreased the number of somites and the development of branchial bars among others in D2. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that both strains of embryos are vulnerable to the same amount and pattern of alcohol exposures at the same developmental stage, but each with unique vulnerability in specific organs, with alcohol having greater teratogenic effects in D2 than in C6. These differential vulnerabilities are results of greater genetic influence, rather than the maternal influence or conditions of alcohol. Copyright © 2005 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: A broad range of attentional and neuropsychological impairments have been demonstrated in children with fetal alcohol exposure. This study was designed to investigate which specific aspects of attentional function are most directly affected by moderate to heavy doses of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: A total of 337 black children who were aged 7.5 years and recruited prospectively to overrepresent prenatal alcohol exposure at moderate to heavy levels were assessed on a diverse battery of neuropsychological tests. Principal components analyses were used to replicate and extend Mirsky et al.'s (1991) four-component model of attention. The relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to empirically derived attentional constructs was examined. Results: Both the replicated and the extended attentional models produced solutions similar to the original Mirsky et al. model, reflecting elements of encode (working memory), shift, and focused and sustained attention, as well as a distinct component reflecting impulsivity. Adverse effects of maternal drinking across pregnancy were found primarily for working memory, and these effects were exacerbated when mothers were aged 30 or older at the time of the child's birth. Conclusions: These data confirm previous studies using diverse methods that suggest that working memory may be the most important aspect of attention that is adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can induce a wide spectrum of adverse effects in offspring. Microcephaly and mental retardation are two major defects of central nervous system (CNS). Most mechanism studies of alcohol-related CNS defects have been focused on the morphologically abnormal tissues, and more attention has been paid to nuclear alteration as opposed to organelle development. METHODS: A mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was used to investigate the effect of alcohol on fetal cerebral mitochondria development. Pregnant mice were given different doses of ethanol intragastrically from GD6 to GD15. Fetal cerebral mitochondria were isolated and analyzed on GD18. RESULTS: Excessive cell apoptosis was found in the cerebra of prenatal alcohol exposure fetuses. Proliferation and differentiation of fetal cerebral mitochondria were inhibited by alcohol. Affected mitochondrial volume constriction and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) accumulation, reduced activities of respiratory chain complex I and IV and ATP synthase were detected in the cerebral tissue without obvious malformed appearance. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired mitochondria development plays a role in the CNS defects induced by prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can frequently lead to a congenital disorder known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS); however, not all children born to alcoholic women develop FAS. Alcohol consumption may affect diverse organs and systems during embryonic development, including craniofacial structures. Small teeth, enamel alterations, and delayed eruption have been observed after ethanol exposure. Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGF-Rs) participate in dental proliferation and differentiation, and changes in these receptors were considered here to be a likely mechanism associated to the dental anomalies observed in this syndrome. Epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (EGF-R) and epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (erbB-2) immunoexpression during the lower first molar morphogenesis was investigated in mouse fetuses exposed to ethanol during gestation. METHODS: Pregnant female mice were divided into groups, consuming either 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25% ethanol solutions, or water (control group). Heads were obtained from 16.5- and 18.5-day fetuses. Immunohistochemistry was applied to EGF-R and erbB-2. RESULTS: At days 16.5 and 18.5, fetuses from 15%, 20%, and 25% ethanol groups showed delayed differentiation, degenerative changes in dental epithelial tissues and reduced dental size; additionally, they displayed an enhanced immunoreactivity to EGF-R and erbB-2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ethanol consumption during pregnancy affects the expression of EGF receptors and induces a delay in murine fetal dental morphogenesis. Dental development is a process that involves a number of growth factors; hence we consider that further research is required to show whether the changes in glycosylation and growth-factor signaling pathways observed in other cells are also involved in the alterations observed in this study. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) are often diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These children show increases in reaction time (RT) variability and false alarms on choice reaction time (CRT) tasks. In this study, adult rats prenatally exposed to ethanol were trained to perform a CRT task. An analysis of the distribution of RTs obtained from the CRT task found that rats with a history of prenatal ethanol exposure had more variable RT distributions, possibly because of lapses of attention. In addition, it was found that, similar to children with FASD, the ethanol-exposed rats had more false alarms. Thus, rats with prenatal ethanol exposure show attention deficits that are similar to those of children with FASD and ADHD.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), the strongest manifestation of FASD, results in short stature, microcephally and facial dysmorphogenesis including microphthalmia. Using Xenopus embryos as a model developmental system, we show that ethanol exposure recapitulates many aspects of FAS, including a shortened rostro-caudal axis, microcephally and microphthalmia. Temporal analysis revealed that Xenopus embryos are most sensitive to ethanol exposure between late blastula and early/mid gastrula stages. This window of sensitivity overlaps with the formation and early function of the embryonic organizer, Spemann's organizer. Molecular analysis revealed that ethanol exposure of embryos induces changes in the domains and levels of organizer-specific gene expression, identifying Spemann's organizer as an early target of ethanol. Ethanol also induces a defect in convergent extension movements that delays gastrulation movements and may affect the overall length. We show that mechanistically, ethanol is antagonistic to retinol (Vitamin A) and retinal conversion to retinoic acid, and that the organizer is active in retinoic acid signaling during early gastrulation. The model suggests that FASD is induced in part by an ethanol-dependent reduction in retinoic acid levels that are necessary for the normal function of Spemann's organizer. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Inner-city, black women are among those groups that are at higher risk for having infants with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders that can include life-long neurobehavioral and cognitive impairments. Chronic alcohol consumption can decrease amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a fatty acid that is essential for optimal infant neural and retinal development in a variety of tissues. Methods: Black women who presented at an inner-city antenatal clinic for their first prenatal visit were recruited into a longitudinal, observational study. Alcohol intake was determined by a structured interview. Participants provided blood specimens and completed food frequency surveys at 24 weeks of gestation, infant delivery, and 3 months postpartum. Fatty acid composition analyses were completed on 307, 260, and 243 for plasma and 278, 261, and 242 erythrocyte specimens at 24 weeks of gestation, delivery, and 3 months postpartum, respectively. Results: Proportion of drinking days at the first prenatal visit was associated with decreased DHA in plasma and erythrocytes throughout the study. This association was the strongest at 24 weeks of gestation. In addition, an interaction between proportion of drinking days at the time of conception and ounces of absolute alcohol per drinking day at the time of conception was detected and demonstrated that, in daily drinkers, high intakes of alcohol are associated with decreased DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations in plasma. Conclusions: Frequent and high intakes of alcohol that have been previously associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are also associated with decreased maternal DHA and AA plasma concentrations. The present findings indicate that maternal DHA deficiency is associated with high-risk drinking and may contribute to the mechanism(s) of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

T1  - Alcohol consumption among women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant--United States, 2002
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with health problems that adversely affect the mother and fetus; no level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been determined safe. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is recognized as the foremost preventable condition involving neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities. Women who drink during pregnancy place themselves at risk for having a child with FAS or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To determine the alcohol consumption patterns among all women of childbearing age, including those who are pregnant or might become pregnant, CDC analyzed data for women aged 18-44 years from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. The results of that analysis indicated that approximately 10% of pregnant women used alcohol, and approximately 2% engaged in binge drinking or frequent use of alcohol. The results further indicated that more than half of women who did not use birth control (and therefore might become pregnant) reported alcohol use and 12.4% reported binge drinking. Women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant should abstain from alcohol use.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) consists of multi-system abnormalities and is caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of alcohol on humans has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and FAS is one of the most important human teratogenic conditions known today. Many investigators have catalogued, quantified and refined these hallmarks of FAS over the years and have established that the most consistent consequences of heavy maternal drinking during pregnancy are prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and brain and craniofacial abnormalities. Many practitioners are unable to recognise the often subtle features associated with FAS and fail to diagnose it. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and discuss the relevance of FAS to clinical dental practice.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes a major risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). This article defines the three syndromes linked to alcohol consumption during pregnancy: (1) FAS, with or without confirmed maternal alcohol exposure; (2) alcohol-related birth defect (ARBD) (3) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). The article also reviews data on alcohol use in pregnant women and in women of child-bearing age. The literature indicates that between 6% and 45% pregnant women have an at-risk alcohol use, and suggests that brief counseling interventions designed to prevent at-risk alcohol use are effective. Studies assessing alcohol use and brief intervention efficacy in pregnant women in Switzerland are needed.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Many of these affected children show retarded physical growth in the postnatal period despite adequate nutrition. On the basis of findings from studies with animals, it has been proposed that this is due to allometric retardation of growth of skeletal muscle, although the exact reasons for this are not known. The aim of the current study was to examine the structural changes in skeletal muscle in fetal alcohol syndrome in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of growth retardation in fetal alcohol syndrome. Chick embryos were exposed to single doses of 5%, 10%, and 15% ethanol, and the effects on the general growth and development, as well as on the skeletal muscle, of these chicks were studied. There was a significant retardation in crown rump length, head circumference, and body weight in ethanol-exposed chicks when these parameters were compared with findings for appropriate control groups. This retardation was associated with significant and proportionate reductions in the weights of skeletal muscles. Microscopic examination of skeletal muscle showed areas of neutrophil infiltration and necrosis, suggestive of muscle damage, in chicks exposed to 10% and 15% ethanol. Thus, findings of the current study demonstrate the direct toxic effects of a single dose of ethanol on developing embryos in general and skeletal muscle in particular. The pathologic changes seen in skeletal muscle could account for the failure in postnatal growth in fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: National initiatives on fetal alcohol syndrome in Canada and the United States aimed at prevention, identification, and treatment of individuals who are affected by alcohol exposure in utero recommend that women abstain from consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Health care providers are key educators regarding appropriate alcohol use. The objective of this study was to describe characteristics of physicians who recommend alcohol abstinence during pregnancy with regard to knowledge of fetal alcohol syndrome and preconception counseling strategies. Methods: A survey was mailed to Canadian physicians and midwives between 2001 and 2002. Participants consisted of a national random sample of 1090 Canadian obstetricians and gynecologists, midwives, and family physicians who were current members of provincial and national professional organizations. The main outcome measure was questionnaire responses to knowledge, prevention, and diagnosis of issues related to alcohol use during pregnancy. Results: Response rates ranged from 31.1% among family physicians to 63.5% among midwives. Overall, 91.2% of providers recommended abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. These providers were significantly more likely to believe that there is sufficient information about alcohol use and that clients were interested in discussing alcohol (p < 0.05). They were also significantly more likely to discuss depression, personal alcohol use, partner's use of alcohol, and family history of alcohol misuse with women of childbearing age (p < 0.05). Once a patient became pregnant, fewer practice differences were noted, although those who recommended alcohol abstinence were significantly more likely to take clinical action when pregnant patients were consuming moderate amounts of alcohol (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It is encouraging that almost 90% of Canadian health care providers recommend abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. However, differences in clinical practice exist between providers who recommend alcohol abstinence during pregnancy as compared with those who recommend a "glass in moderation".

N2  - Background: In contrast to the extensive literature documenting IQ deficits in patients with fetal alcohol syndrome, effects on IQ have not generally been reported for children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). This study examined the role of maternal age, MAST, and quality of parenting in moderating the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the WISC-III IQ test in moderate-to-heavily exposed children. Methods: A total of 337 inner-city African American children whose mothers were recruited prenatally were administered the WISC-III at 7.5 years. Alcohol exposure was assesed with a timeline follow-back interview administered at every prenatal clinic visit. Moderating effects of the three risk factors were examined by adding interaction terms to regression analyses and dichotomizing the moderators and performing separate regressions on the two groups. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was related to WISC-III Freedom from Distractibility but not to Full Scale IQ for the sample as a whole. However, among children born to older mothers, an alcohol effect emerged on Full Scale IQ and five of seven composite IQ scores. Similarly, adverse effects were seen among children of MAST-positive mothers and children whose parents provided less optimal cognitive stimulation. Each additional ounce of absolute alcohol consumed per day during pregnancy was associated with a 2.9-point decrease in Full Scale IQ and a 5.6-point decrement on Freedom from Distractibility. Conclusions: This study is the first to demonstrate IQ effects among children with ARND born to older and MAST-positive mothers, particularly in relation to first-trimester drinking. These findings suggest that there are subgroups of more vulnerable and severely affected children whose intellectual performance is compromised. A moderate- to heavy-drinking mother who has given birth to an unaffected child when she was younger needs to be warned that her risk of having an adversely affected child increases as she grows older.

N2  - Aims: To determine the alcohol exposure and pharmacokinetics of alcohol in a group of women who had given birth to children wit FAS, compared with women who had not given birth to FAS children. Methods: 10 women who had given birth to FAS children (FAS mothers) and 20 Controls were studied to determine how they metabolize alcohol in a single limited-access quasi-experimental session of voluntary consumption of alcohol. They had free choice in the consumption of any amount of their favourite beverage for ~2.5 h, but their drinking was terminated if the breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) exceeded 150 mg%. BrACs was measured during ethanol consumption and for several hours after, for estimation of alcohol exposure and pharmacokinetics. Results: FAS mothers consumed significantly larger amounts of alcohol, and achieved significantly higher peak BrAC levels than Controls. The rate of decline of alcohol from the circulation (beta-60) showed a 2-fold variation across subjects but there was no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions: This study did not show any difference in alcohol pharmacokinetics in free-choice drinking by non-pregnant women, who either have given or have never given birth to FAS children. However, mothers of FAS children tend to consume more alcohol per session. Future studies in larger samples will be needed to confirm these findings and to examine drinking patterns and other factors that may increase the risk of FAS in children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © Medical Council on Alcohol 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in morphological abnormalities in the fetuses of humans and experimental animals, and is referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, the molecular mechanism underlying FAS has not been completely elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced FAS in the developing embryo and fetus. cDNA microarray analysis was used to screen for altered gene profiles. Ethanol at a teratogenic dosage (3.8 g/kg, twice a day) was administered intraperitoneally to pregnant C57BI/6J mice from gestation day (GD) 6 to 8. Morphologic observations showed excessive malformations of the craniofacial regions (reduction of the face, the absence of eyes, nose, jaw, and mandible, underdevelopment of vibrissae areas, cleft lip, and palate) in ethanol-exposed embryos (GD 10) and fetusus (GD 75). cDNA microarray analysis showed alterations in several gene profiles, including the "palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone (plunc)," "neurofilament," and "pale ear." Of these genes, the expressions of plunc were confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and whole-mount in situ hybridization. The plunc was highly expressed in the craniofacial region, specifically in upper airways and nasopharyngeal epithelium. RT-PCR analysis revealed that normal plunc mRNA expression levels were present in GD 75 fetuses, but not in GD 10 embryos. Interestingly, ethanol significantly downregulated the plunc expression in GD 75 fetuses. Our results suggest that ethanol-induced FAS is due in part to the downregulation of plunc expression in the fetus, and this gene may be a candidate biological marker for FAS.

N2  - Alcohol-related pathologies lead to most serious expressions, both at clinical and social level. The diffused social acceptance of consumption and abuse behavior and the lack of alcohol education for professionals (physicians, psychologists, social workers etc.) make difficult to put in the right frame this issue. Just a multidimensional approach can make the problem understandable. The history of alcohol consumption during the time gives us an exhaustive picture of the negative consequences of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a problem still underestimated and represents a serious risk for the health of the newborns: children alcohol-exposed in uterus are at risk to develop many pathologies and even the fetal-alcohol syndrome (FAS) that leads to facial anomalies, growth deficiencies and neurological damages. Therefore interventions coping with this kind of issues are needed in order to enhance people's health.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome prevention in Washington State: Evidence of success
A1  - Astley S.J.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a permanent birth defect syndrome caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. It is characterised by growth deficiency, central nervous system damage/dysfunction, and a unique cluster of minor facial anomalies. To assess the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts, one must be able to estimate accurately the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome over time in population-based samples. With the establishment of the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network of clinics, the development of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Facial Photographic Analysis Software, the creation of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the establishment of the Foster Care Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Screening Program, and the collection of Pregnancy Risk Assessment Management System data on maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy, the tools, methods and infrastructure for assessing the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome primary prevention efforts in Washington State are in place. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine whether the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among children in a foster care population, born between 1993 and 1998, decreased with the documented decrease in prevalence of maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy from 1993 and 1998 in Washington State. The prevalence of maternal drinking during pregnancy in Washington State declined significantly (P < 0.001) from 1993 to 1998 as did the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among foster children born 1993-98 (P < 0.03). These observations support the likelihood that fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts in Washington State are working successfully.

T1  - Implicit strategy affects learning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Roebuck-Spencer T.M.
A1  - Mattson S.N.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Learning and memory deficits are commonly reported in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Our recent work suggested that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure retained information as well as controls on a verbal learning test but not on a test of nonverbal learning and memory. To better understand the cause of this differential pattern of performance, the current study re-analyzed data from our previous study to determine if the presence of an implicit learning strategy may account, at least in part, for the finding of spared retention. Methods: The current study examined verbal learning and memory abilities in 35 children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and 34 nonexposed controls (CON) matched for age (9-16 years), sex, ethnicity, handedness, and socioeconomic status. Groups were compared on two measures of verbal learning, one with an implicit strategy (California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version; CVLT-C) and one without (Verbal Learning subtest of the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning; VL-WRAML). Results: Children with FASD learned less information overall than children in the CON group. Both groups learned a greater percentage of information and reached a learning plateau earlier on the CVLT-C compared with the VL-WRAML. Groups also showed comparable rates of retention after a delay on the CVLT-C. In contrast, on the VL-WRAML, children with FASD showed poorer retention rates than children in the CON group. Interestingly, children with FASD did not differ from children in the CON group on CVLT-C semantic clustering scores for learning trials 1 through 3, and greater utilization of semantic clustering was correlated with better learning and memory performance in both groups. This overall pattern of results was not related to overall intellectual level. Conclusions: The finding of spared retention of verbal information on the CVLT-C in our earlier studies may be related to test characteristics of the CVLT-C rather than a finding of spared verbal retention per se, given that spared retention was not found on a separate test of verbal learning and memory without an implicit learning strategy. These results suggest that the use of an implicit strategy positively affected the ability of alcohol-exposed children to learn and retain new verbal information.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a group of clinical features which appears in the fetus after prenatal alcohol exposure. It is a well known fact that alcohol is the most frequent teratogenic agent, and that its effects can be prevented, should alcoholic intake be avoided during pregnancy. Physical, neurologic and behavioral anomalies can show even after low doses. We try to update in this paper the diagnostic criteria of FAS, to point out the main aspects of alcohol metabolism, its relationship with the placenta and the possible mechanisms of its teratogenic action. We report the clinical features of 13 patients diagnosed at our institution during the last 15 years.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - We compared the rate of all-cause mortality in siblings of children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) with the siblings of matched controls. The siblings of children with FAS had increased mortality (11.4%) compared with matched controls (2.0%), a 530% increase in mortality. The age of death in case siblings deaths occurred later (between 1 day and 7 years) compared with the controls (1 day to 4 years) [odds ratio (OR) = 2.4 (0.4-15.6)]. Siblings of children with FAS had increased risk of death due to infectious illness [OR = 13.7 (1.2-361)] and sudden infant death syndrome compared with controls [OR = 10.2 (1.2-75.1)]. A diagnosis of FAS is an important risk marker for mortality in the siblings of the proband even if they do not have FAS. Maternal alcoholism appears to be a useful risk marker for increased mortality risk in diagnosed cases and their siblings. This has important implications in the management of family members of children with FAS.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which may increase the risk of confinement in the corrections system. In the United States each state and four major cities' corrections systems were asked to complete a questionnaire on the prevalence of FAS and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) in the offender population, the availability of screening and diagnostic services to identify offenders with FAS and staff training needs related to FAS. The total population in the 54 entities was 3 080904 inmates. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 42 entities (78%). The mean rate of reported substance abuse in offenders was 60.1%. Specialized programs for persons with mental retardation were reported for 44.4% of corrections facilities and 25.9% of community corrections facilities. Programs for pregnant women were reported for 46.3% of corrections facilities and 29.6% of community facilities. One program (1.9%) reported having a screening program for FAS in the corrections system. Only four programs (7.4%) reported having access to diagnostic services for FAS in the corrections facilities. Of the 3 080 904 offenders, only one offender was reported to have a diagnosis of FAS. Reported staff training needs were very large. In conclusion, corrections systems have high unmet needs to screen, identify, and treat offenders with FAS and ARND. Staff training needs are substantial.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes long-term serotonin neuron deficit in mice
A1  - Sari Y.
A1  - Zhou F.C.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Previous work from this laboratory showed that prenatal alcohol exposure at approximately 100 mg/dl from embryonic day (E)7 to early midgestation reduced the number and retarded the migration of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the raphe nuclei in C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we report that the deficit of 5-HT neurons found in midgestation persisted on E18 and into young adulthood. Methods: Pregnant dams were treated from E7 to E18 in three groups-(1) the alcohol group, fed with liquid diet with 25% ethanol-derived calories; (2) the isocaloric pair-fed group; and (3) the chow group for analysis of concentrations of active caspase-3-to study apoptosis at E18 in the brainstem and the number of 5-HT neurons at E18 and postnatal day 45. The concentrations of active caspase-3 were determined by using a colorimetric assay, and the 5-HT neurons were determined by immunocytochemistry. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure increased the concentration of active caspase-3 in the brainstem and caused reductions in brain weight by 20% and in the total number of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei by 20% at E18 as compared with those of the pair-fed and chow controls. Continuous observation from prenatal to postnatal stages showed that the reduction of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei persisted in the young adult stage. Conclusions: Upon prenatal alcohol exposure, an increased concentration of active caspase-3 and a decreased number of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the brainstem were observed at E18. The decreased number of 5-HT neurons persisted to the young adult stage of postnatal day 45. This suggests that ethanol has a long-lasting effect on 5-HT deficit. A fetal alcohol exposure-rendered lasting deficit of 5-HT and other transmitter systems may underlie the neuropsychiatric deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

A1  - Mahmood A.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption by pregnant animals and humans leads to general growth impairment in their offspring, delayed growth and multiple birth defects collectively called "Fetal Alcohol Syndrome". In utero exposure of ethanol to rat pups causes damage to their developing intestinal epithelium which leads to impairment of nutrient assimilation and growth retardation during postnatal development. Aim To determine the effect of prenatal exposure of ethanol on the postnatal development of rat intestinal Na+-dependent and independent D-glucose transporter along with the amino acids (glycine and L-leucine) transporter activity at 4, 8, 14, 20 and 30 days of postnatal age. The changes in the expression levels of Na +-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1) mRNA was assessed at different days of postnatal age in rat pups. Methods: Wistar strain albino female rats were fed ethanol at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight/day orally by Ryle's tube for one month before mating and during the entire period of gestation while the control females received isocaloric glucose. Transport studies were performed using the everted intestine of 4, 8, 14, 20 and 30 day-old control and ethanol-exposed pups employing the tissue accumulation method. The expression of SGLT1 mRNA at different days of postnatal age in control and ethanol-exposed rat pups was determined using a Northern Blot analysis. Results: Prenatal exposure of ethanol to rat pups leads to a decrease in their body weight, intestinal length and weight and reduces the uptake capacities of SGLT1 as well as energy dependent glycine and L-leucine transporters with respect to their age-matched controls. However, the mRNA levels of SGLT1 remained unaltered in the ethanol-exposed pups at all ages of postnatal development compared to their controls. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in utero exposure to ethanol leads to a general delay in the postnatal development of the intestine of ethanol-exposed rat pups affecting mainly the development of intestinal energy dependent D-glucose and amino acid (glycine and L-leucine) transporters.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The classic clinical criteria for the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) include a "characteristic" facial appearance, pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, mental retardation, and occasional major malformations. However, diagnostic constraints, especially in the newborn period, lead to an underestimate of their prevalence. We report an epidemiological study of the potential risk of congenital defects in the offspring of mothers who ingested different sporadic and daily amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. METHODS: The study was based on the data from the ECEMC hospital-based case-control study and surveillance system, with a methodology aimed not only at the surveillance of congenital anomalies, but also at investigating their characteristics, clustering, and causes. For the purposes of this study, we considered as exposed those infants whose mothers reported the ingestion of any amount of alcohol during gestation (4705 mothers of cases and 4329 mothers of controls), and classified them into five groups according to their levels of alcohol consumption. Two groups consisted of mothers who consumed increasing sporadic levels and the other three consisted of mothers who consumed increasing daily levels of alcohol. RESULTS: Our study showed that even low sporadic doses of alcohol consumption during pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital anomalies in the offspring and that this risk increases with increasing levels of alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that it is necessary to generalize the preventive norm and recommend complete abstinence from alcohol during gestation. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Fetal, Infant, and Child Mortality in a Context of Alcohol Use
A1  - Burd L.
A1  - Wilson H.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Alcohol is an important element in the causal chain of risk for fetal, infant, and childhood mortality. Mortality risk is influenced by interactions of alcohol with other environmental and genetic factors and temporal periods of susceptibility. In this paper we discuss four time periods (preconceptual, gestational, infancy, and childhood) where alcohol use may create a context of risk. Alcohol use in one period increases the risk of alcohol use in subsequent periods. Gestational alcohol use can influence risk of mortality from abuse of mother/fetus, can cause other adverse outcomes, and can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In infancy alcohol use can increase risk from impairment of arousal in adults who use alcohol. Infants with gestational exposure can be behaviorally difficult with sleep disturbance, irritability, and colic. This can increase the risk of harm or death, especially during periods of caretakers' alcohol use. Caretakers' alcohol use and smoking are strongly correlated. The all-cause mortality rate in people diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is over 5%. All-cause mortality in siblings of diagnosed cases of FAS is increased 530% compared to siblings of matched controls. We recommend that a context of alcohol use be considered as a marker for multifactorial risk in all fetal, infant, and child deaths. A schema to collect data on alcohol use is provided to increase awareness of alcohol use as an environmental risk marker for mortality. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common identifiable teratogenic cause of mental retardation, neurological deficit, mental disorders, and developmental disabilities. Accurate estimates of the cost of care for persons with FAS are essential for appropriate funding of health care, developmental disabilities services, special education, and other service systems, as well as prioritizing funding of public health prevention efforts. The cost of care for individuals with FAS can be conceptualized as the annual cost of care for one person or a population, or as the lifetime cost of care for an individual. Annual cost estimates for the United States range from $75 million in 1984 to $4.0 billion in 1998. Estimates of lifetime cost vary from $596,000 in 1980 to $1.4 million in 1988. After adjustments for changes in inflation and population, 2002 estimates of total annual cost and lifetime cost are higher. FAS is increasingly being recognized as a large public health problem with high potential for the prevention of future cases and for the prevention of excess disability and premature mortality in persons who are affected. Each day, from 6-22 infants with FAS are born in the United States, and as many as 87-103 more are born with other impairments resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Updated and improved cost data on FAS should be a research priority. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Recognition of Facial Features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in the Newborn

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The diagnosis of an infant, especially a newborn, with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is difficult due to the fact that not all of the features are apparent at that time. Many cases are also missed due to inadequate knowledge of the mother's drinking pattern and because of the examining physician's lack of experience with the disorder. While conducting a study of the use of maternal blood markers to determine alcohol use in pregnancy, we have evaluated systematically the effects of alcohol on the newborn infant. We have developed a facial scoring system consisting of six of the features commonly seen in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and present preliminary data about its use. By using a cutoff of four or more of these six features, there is a significant correlation with the presence of these features and the mother's self-reported alcohol use. In addition, there has been no significant difference in the frequency of positive scores between newborns of Caucasian or Black ancestry. We propose that this system may be useful in the assessment of newborn infants at high risk because of alcohol exposure during pregnancy. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Data were obtained from three samples of women of childbearing age. One sample of women is from prenatal clinics serving Plains Indian women. The second sample is of women from the Plains whose children were referred to special diagnostic developmental clinics, as their children were believed to have developmental issues consistent with prenatal alcohol consumption. The third sample is of women from South Africa, each of whom has given birth to a child diagnosed with full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Data across samples conform to expected trends on many variables. For example, the maternal age at time of pregnancy, a major risk factor for FAS, ranged from a mean of 23.5 years for the prenatal clinic sample, to 23.8 years for the developmental clinic sample, to 27.6 for the sample of women who have delivered children with FAS. Other variables of maternal risk for FAS expected from the extant literature, such as high gravidity and parity, binge drinking, heavy intergenerational drinking in the mother's extended family and immediate social network, and length of drinking career, were compared across the three samples with variable results. However, normative measures of drinking problems are unreliable when reported across cultures. An unexpected finding from this three-sample comparison was the differential risk found when comparing U.S. women to South African women. Women in the U.S. Plains Indian samples report a high consumption of alcohol in a binge pattern of drinking, yet there is less detectable damage to the fetus than among the South African women. Body mass index (BMI) and lifelong and current nutrition may have a substantial impact, along with the above factors, in relative risk for an FAS birth. The level of risk for producing a child with FAS is influenced by environmental and behavioral conditions that vary between populations and among individual women. Also, because many syndromes are genetically based, there is a need for full behavioral and genetic histories of the mother, family, and child being studied. Collecting extensive behavioral information as well as genetic histories will provide the requisite information for making an accurate diagnosis of FAS. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy is a leading, preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States, with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) being one of the most severe outcomes. Current survey statistics find that approximately one in eight pregnant women (500,000 per year) report alcohol use, with approximately 80,000 reporting binge drinking. While annual rates have fluctuated, trends analysis finds that there has been no significant change in rates of prenatal alcohol exposure over the past 10-year period. Development of effective programs to prevent FAS and to monitor the success of prevention efforts requires epidemiological data systems to inform these activities. This article describes alcohol use patterns among childbearing-age women and data sources that can be used in monitoring this behavior.

N2  - The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a "Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health Disparities 2002: A Call to Arms," on December 5, 2002, in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. This workshop was part of the NIAAA/NIH comprehensive strategic plan to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities. Eleven topics were addressed: (1) biomedical risk factors that may contribute to disparities in the toxic effects of alcohol; (2) alcohol and gene-environment interactions that affect the health of diverse groups; (3) alcohol pharmacogenetics in Mexican-Americans; (4) determinants of risk for alcoholism in minority populations; (5) consideration of population groups in linkage-disequilibrium studies to identify genes associated with alcohol dependence; (6) interaction between alcohol dependence and African-American ethnicity in disordered sleep, nocturnal cytokines, and immunity; (7) disparities of brain functional reserve capacity affecting brain morbidity related to substance abuse; (8) alcohol and pregnancy disparities; (9) role of alcohol in cancer risk disparities; (10) ethnic diversity in alcoholic cardiomyopathy; and (11) postmenopausal health disparities. On the basis of these presentations, seven conclusions emerged: (1) Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes exist in various populations. (2) These enzymes play a role in the variation in health effect outcomes seen in different populations, owing to alcohol consumption. (3) Differences between and among population groups can be critically important for the design and interpretation of studies in genetics. These include differences in expression of phenotype, in locus heterogeneity, in risk alleles, and in population structure. (4) Incidence rates for fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are greater in African-Americans and Native-Americans than in Caucasians. Genetic polymorphisms, nutrition, and other factors may account for these differences. (5) The highest mortality rate for cirrhosis has been found in white Hispanic men. (6) Mexican-Americans have a low frequency of the protective alleles ADH1B*2 and ALDH2*2 and a relatively high frequency of CYP2E1 c2, which is associated with early onset alcoholism. (7) The incidence rate for cancer is greater for African-Americans than for Caucasians, and part of the higher risk may be attributed to heavier drinking. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Maternal prenatal alcohol use is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities. On the severe end of the spectrum of conditions related to drinking during pregnancy is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Physicians and other health practitioners play a critical role in diagnosing FAS and in screening women of childbearing age for alcohol use during pregnancy. The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Team at CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities awarded funds to four medical school partners (Meharry and Morehouse Medical Colleges, St. Louis University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and the University of California at Los Angeles) to develop FAS regional training centers (RTCs). The RTCs are developing, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating educational curricula for medical and allied health students and practitioners that incorporate evidence-based diagnostic guidelines for FAS and other prenatal alcohol-related disorders. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background: This study investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on learning and memory in 14-year-old adolescents. The Children's Memory Scale was used to assess learning and memory function in the verbal/auditory and visual/spatial domains. In addition, both short- and long-term memory function were assessed. Methods: Data were collected as part of the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project, a longitudinal study including 580 children and their mothers. Women were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy and with their children from birth to 16 years of age. At age 14, memory function was evaluated using the Children's Memory Scale, an assessment tool that measures learning and immediate and delayed memory function in the verbal and visual-spatial domains. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure during the first trimester predicted deficits in learning, short-term memory, and long-term memory, specifically in the verbal domain. Deficits in performance were specific to learning and memory of word-pairs. In addition, deficits in memory were mediated by learning performance. Conclusions: Results demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure lead to deficits in encoding processes as indicated by deficits in verbal learning. Initial deficits in acquisition were responsible for deficits in immediate and delayed recall of verbal information in children who were exposed to alcohol during pregnancy but did not have fetal alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - In Australia the issue of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has not been the subject of policy development or of extensive research. There is a lack of knowledge, both in the general community and by health professionals, of the nature of the risks associated with heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the factors that increase this risk. This paper reviews the literature surrounding FAS with the aim of providing the reader an understanding of the diagnostic features and epidemiology of FAS and of the developmental sequelae associated with this syndrome.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Health care providers can more effectively prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and prenatal alcohol exposure if they know more about mothers who have children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or some characteristics of FAS. METHODS: We conducted two retrospective case-control studies of Northern Plains Indian children with FAS and some characteristics of FAS diagnosed from 1981 to 1993 by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71. We compared mothers who had children with FAS or some characteristics of FAS with mothers who had children that did not have FAS. RESULTS: Compared with control mothers, 43 mothers who had children with FAS and 35 mothers who had children with some characteristics of FAS were older, had fewer prenatal visits, more pregnancies, more mental health problems, and more injuries (both total and alcohol-related). Although the prevalence of drinking was high in both case and control mothers, case mothers had more alcohol-related medical problems, drank heavily, in binges, and daily more often than control mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Women with injuries and mental health problems should be screened for substance use. Mothers of children with FAS or of some characteristics of FAS have numerous needs that must be addressed to prevent future prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Because alcohol is a known teratogenic substance that negatively affects the fetus, screening for alcohol use is included in maternal child texts for nurses. They present no standard screening approach, however. In the general literature, a multitude of screening instruments exist for the purpose of detecting maternal alcohol dependence but few allow the nurse to detect fetal alcohol exposure in the absence of maternal alcohol dependence. After a comparative analysis of existing screening instruments, we concluded that the Timeline Followback method has the most utility as a screening instrument to detect fetal exposure to alcohol. The purpose of this article is to present a critical review of current screening instruments related to alcohol consumption in pregnant women and to propose the use of the Timeline Followback method as the preferred approach.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome--South Africa, 2001
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities. The FAS phenotype is characterized by a combination of facial dysmorphic features, growth retardation, and central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. State-based estimates of the prevalence of FAS in the United States vary from 0.3 to 1.5 per 1,000 live-born infants. Recently, the highest prevalence of FAS worldwide was reported among first-grade children in a wine-growing region in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Investigators for the National Institutes of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) reported a FAS prevalence of 40.5 to 46.4 per 1,000 children aged 5-9 years in one community in Western Cape. To determine whether FAS was associated exclusively with the wine-growing region in Western Cape or was more endemic in other areas of the country, CDC, in collaboration with the University of Witwatersrand and the Foundation for Alcohol Related Research in Johannesburg, South Africa, conducted a prevalence study in Gauteng province and is developing ongoing surveillance and prevention activities. This report summarizes the findings of the study, which indicate a high prevalence of FAS among first-grade children in four nonwine-growing communities around Johannesburg. Because South Africa has limited resources and many competing health problems (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases), integrating prenatal alcohol-exposure prevention activities with existing prevention programs should be explored.

T1  - Motivational intervention to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies--Florida, Texas, and Virginia, 1997-2001
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol use is a threat to healthy pregnancy outcomes for many U.S. women. During 1999, approximately 500,000 pregnant women reported having one or more drinks during the preceding month, and approximately 130,000 reported having seven or more alcohol drinks per week or engaging in binge drinking (i.e., five or more drinks in a day). These heavier drinking patterns have been associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (ARND). Lower levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., fewer than seven drinks per week) also have been associated with measurable effects on children's development and behavior. Although the majority of women reduce their alcohol use substantially when they realize they are pregnant, a large proportion do not realize they are pregnant until well into the first trimester and, therefore, might continue to drink alcohol during this critical period of fetal development. To reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies, CDC initiated a multisite pilot study (phase I clinical trial) in 1997 to investigate the use of a dual intervention focused on both alcohol-use reduction and effective contraception among childbearing-aged women at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (Project CHOICES). This report describes the association between baseline drinking measures and the success women have achieved in reducing their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The analysis compares the impact of the motivational intervention at 6-month follow-up on women drinking at high-, medium-, and low-risk drinking levels. The findings indicate that although 69% of the women in the study reduced their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, women with the lowest baseline drinking measures achieved the highest rates of outcome success, primarily by choosing effective contraception and, secondarily, by reducing alcohol use. Women with higher baseline drinking measures chose both approaches equally but achieved lower success rates for reducing their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial of the motivational intervention is under way to further investigate outcomes of the phase I study.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an integrated review of the literature on fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), focusing on the definition of FAS/FAE, their incidence and related problems, gestational research findings, FAS symptoms, the effects of prenatal alcohol consumption on offspring over time, and FAS/FAE preventive measures. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches of MEDLINE and Web sites, as well as reference lists from published articles on FAS/FAE from 1973 to present. STUDY SELECTION: Literature was chosen from refereed journals and from current publications of the National Organization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using keywords relevant to FAS and FAS prevention. DATA SYNTHESIS: The consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can harm the fetus irreparably. Preventive measures can be helpful in decreasing or stopping the use of alcohol during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol is a definite teratogen. The amount of alcohol, if any, that can be safely consumed during pregnancy, the exact physiological mechanisms that make alcohol unsafe for the fetus, and the most effective prevention measures have yet to be identified. FAS/FAE is still increasing in the United States.

N2  - Background: Health care providers can more effectively prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and prenatal alcohol exposure if they know more about mothers who have children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or some characteristics of FAS. Methods: We conducted two retrospective case-control studies of Northern Plains Indian children with FAS and some characteristics of FAS diagnosed from 1981 to 1993 by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71. We compared mothers who had children with FAS or some characteristics of FAS with mothers who had children that did not have FAS. Results: Compared with control mothers, 43 mothers who had children with FAS and 35 mothers who had children with some characteristics of FAS were older, had fewer prenatal visits, more pregnancies, more mental health problems, and more injuries (both total and alcohol-related). Although the prevalence of drinking was high in both case and control mothers, case mothers had more alcohol-related medical problems, drank heavily, in binges, and daily more often than control mothers. Conclusions: Women with injuries and mental health problems should be screened for substance use. Mothers of children with FAS or of some characteristics of FAS have numerous needs that must be addressed to prevent future prenatal alcohol exposure.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Objective: The present study had two aims: (1) to examine the prevalence rates of prenatal alcohol consumption in a group of women participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in Southern California, with special emphasis on Hispanic women, and (2) to identify variables associated with postconception drinking in low-income minority women. Method: The study employed a cross-sectional survey that assessed alcohol use rates, demographic variables, and alcohol risk status. Participants were 826 pregnant women enrolled in the Public Health Foundation Enterprises (PHFE) WIC Program in Los Angeles and Orange counties, California. Pregnant women who enrolled self-administered a specially designed alcohol screener. Results: Findings were that 24% of sample women were consuming alcohol post conception. Of that percentage, approximately two thirds drank prior to pregnancy recognition, and one third continued to drink after pregnancy was confirmed. Approximately 30% of white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic and English-speaking Hispanic women were found to drink post conception compared with 15.8% of Spanish-speaking Hispanic women. This finding supported recent research that suggests more acculturated Hispanic women tend to incorporate the drinking patterns of the larger U.S. population to a greater extent than less acculturated Hispanic women. Although a number of demographic variables differentiated women who were abstinent from those who were postconception drinkers, the best predictor of postconception alcohol consumption was the woman's high-risk drinking score as measured by the TWEAK (sensitivity = 70.1%, specificity = 88.5%). Conclusions: Results suggest the importance of screening low-income minority pregnant women in a community setting so that interventions can be initiated to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and related conditions.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and ADHD: Diagnostic implications and therapeutic consequences
A1  - O'Malley K.D.
A1  - Storoz L.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The first association between prenatal alcohol exposure and a teratogenic effect in the developing fetus was made in 1968 by pediatrician Paul Lemoine in France. A few years later, Jones and Smith defined the fetal alcohol syndrome which combined dysmorphic facial, growth and CNS features. The classic fetal alcohol syndrome has been recently reviewed. Current research is beginning to acknowledge that exposure to differing levels of prenatal alcohol cause a spectrum of clinical conditions which can be grouped under the umbrella term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. There are three subtypes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: full fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome (where there is only partial facial dysmorphology) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (where there is no facial dysmorphology and often absence of growth features). The term alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder is gradually replacing the older term fetal alcohol effects. These subtypes were initially described by Stratton and colleagues in 1996. It is also becoming clearer that the full fetal alcohol syndrome as originally described by Jones and Smith, and diagnosed in dysmorphic clinics, is the least common clinical subtype resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. In addition, current and ongoing research on brain structure, shape and function indicates that the brain abnormality is not correlated with the facial dysmorphology or intelligence quotient. Therefore, the presence of full fetal alcohol syndrome does not necessarily mean that the patient has the most severe CNS impairments. Genetic research has suggested that genetic factors may have a role in a modulating a woman's susceptibility to having a baby with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (specifically the full fetal alcohol syndrome subtype). Thus, genetic factors may increase the variability of the teratogenic effect of prenatal exposure to alcohol on the developing fetus.

T1  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on infant mental development: A meta-analytical review

A1  - Das Eiden R.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Aims: Although research on fetal alcohol exposure has had a significant effect on social norms and public policy, there has been little quantitative review of this literature. Methods: Meta-analysis was used to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on infant mental development, assessed using the Mental Development Index (MDI) from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, a widely used, standardized measure. The current study examined the effects of three levels of average daily exposure during pregnancy: less than 1 drink per day, 1-1.99 drinks per day and 2 or more drinks per day. Analyses were conducted separately for effects derived from observations of 6-8-, 12-13- and 18-26-month-old children. Results: Fetal alcohol exposure at all three dosage levels was associated with significantly lower MDI scores among 12-13-month-olds. The effect was attenuated, but not eliminated, when effect sizes adjusted for relevant covariates were used. For younger and older children, the effect of fetal alcohol exposure did not attain statistical significance at any dosage level. Conclusions: This pattern of results may reflect differences in MDI item content at different ages and the differential sensitivity of these abilities to prenatal alcohol exposure. Because the body of relevant literature is neither large nor conclusive, and because of heterogeneity in measurement, analysis and samples, caution is urged in interpreting results. Future research would benefit from use of more specific measures of infant outcomes and consideration of the impact of relevant covariates, different dosage patterns and timing of drinking on infant mental development.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The aims of the study were, first, to perform a comprehensive assessment of neurocognitive status in early adolescence of children exposed to alcohol prenatally; and, second, to examine whether duration of exposure continues to be predictive of outcome at this age. Twenty-seven exposed 12-14-year-olds and 39 non-exposed 13-14-year-olds underwent neuropsychological assessments (WISC-III, NEPSY subtests) of attention and executive functions, language, visuomotor functions, and memory. The group of non-exposed children was used to develop preliminary test norms for the 13-14-year-old exposed children whereas published test norms could be used for the 12-year-olds. The results demonstrated neurocognitive impairment across all types of tasks. Impairment varied in degree according to the duration of alcohol exposure. Children exposed throughout pregnancy, most of who had diagnoses of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) or Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE), performed well below the average range. It was concluded that the neurocognitive effects of alcohol exposure tend to be widespread and generalized. Attention and executive functions do not seem to be selectively affected. Further, the relationship between duration of prenatal alcohol exposure and neurocognitive development continues to be significant in early adolescence.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - We employed a computerized (virtual) Morris water task (VMWT) to measure place learning and cued-navigation in eight adolescent males (9.5-16.5 years old) diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Eight adolescent males matched for age and ethnicity with no history of prenatal alcohol exposure served as controls. Participants were trained to navigate to a hidden platform in a fixed location relative to a set of four conspicuous extramaze cues. After 20 hidden platform trials, a single no-platform probe trial was conducted, followed by 8 trials during which the platform was visible (cued-navigation). The FAS group traveled further than controls to navigate to the hidden platform during training. During the probe trial, controls navigated more directly to the platform region and persisted in searching where the platform had been more than the FAS group. Cued-navigation was comparable in both groups, suggesting that group differences in place learning were not attributable to visual-motor or motivational deficits in the FAS subjects. This pattern of impaired place learning and spared cued-navigation is similar to that reported in rats exposed to ethanol during periods of prenatal or early postnatal brain growth, as well as in animals with hippocampal damage. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) display altered performance in tasks of learning and memory, behaviours thought to be associated with the hippocampus. Altered hippocampal structure has been reported in some FAS children; therefore, a rat model system was used to determine whether the size and numbers of pyramidal cells in regions CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampal formation and granule cells in the dentate gyrus were altered by alcohol exposure during different periods of development. Rat pups were exposed to alcohol in utero during the second trimester-equivalent (E10-20), the first two trimesters-equivalent (E1-20), during the time of hippocampal pyramidal cell neurogenesis (E16-20), part of the third trimester-equivalent (P4-9), and all three trimesters-equivalent (E1-20+P4-9). Control animals (nutritional and untreated) were reared for all treatment conditions. All pups were perfused on P10. CA1 volume, pyramidal cell density, and number were reduced in pups treated with alcohol during the third trimester-equivalent, whether unique or as exposure during all three trimesters-equivalent. CA3 volume was reduced in alcohol-treated animals across all gestational ages; however, pyramidal cell density and number in this region were only reduced in animals treated with alcohol during the third trimester-equivalent. Volume of the dentate gyrus did not appear to be affected by alcohol treatment. Granule cell density and number in this region were reduced in animals treated with alcohol during the third trimester-equivalent. The third trimester-equivalent in the rat appears to be a developmental period during which the hippocampus is particularly susceptible to the effects of alcohol consumption. The resulting damage to the hippocampus may contribute to the behavioural deficits related to learning and memory noted in children with FAS. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background and Objective: The fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is considered as the main preventable cause of congenital defects and mental deficiency. We analyzed whether the consumption of alcohol during gestation has changed in Spain. Subjects and Method: We analyzed the evolution over the last 24 years, as well as the geographical distribution according to Spanish regions, of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. We used data from the ECEMC, a registry which includes 1,820,862 liveborns, of whom 30,836 were malformed. A similar number of healthy controls was collected. We established 5 increasing levels of alcohol consumption, for sporadic and diary intakes, and 3 levels of maternal scholarship. Results: Except for the lowest and highest intakes, alcohol consumption levels showed a decreasing trend over the time. These tendencies were similar in almost all Spanish regions. When comparing the intake between regions, the differences were statistically significant. There was a correlation between the maternal scholarship and the alcohol intake, showing that the higher the education the lower the amount of alcohol consumption. Conclusions: The awareness of the alcohol effects is related to the maternal cultural level. Maternal consumption of alcohol varies across Spanish regions, though its trends are similar.

N2  - Background: Although the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) varies within the population, few data are available concerning variation in the prevalence of prenatal drinking. Methods: Postpartum women delivering singleton infants at two Atlanta hospitals in 1993 or 1994 were interviewed. Those delivering infants who were small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 638) were over-sampled relative to those delivering infants with birth weights that were appropriate for gestational age (AGA) (n = 247). The prevalence of prenatal drinking was estimated as a weighted average of reports from mothers of SGA and AGA infants. Estimates of the prevalence of FAS come from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: The prevalence of first-trimester drinking was half that reported for the three previous months (private hospital: 72% vs. 35%; public hospital: 52% vs. 28%). Most women (85%) reported abstaining throughout the second trimester. Fewer than 10% of women delivering at the public hospital (7.5%), but one-quarter of those delivering at the private hospital, reported third-trimester drinking. Binge, moderate and heavy drinking in pregnancy were more common among women delivering at the public hospital. Eight infants born at the public hospital during this period, but none of those born at the private hospital, were identified as possibly having FAS; four of the eight were identified as probably having FAS. Conclusions: These results have implications for health education programs. For example, obstetricians in private practice may wish to reaffirm their advice to abstain from drinking in the third trimester. They also suggest that prenatal abstinence programs be targeted at populations identified as most likely to engage in risky drinking.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a major public health issue that is evident on an international scale. The current article summarizes a meeting that was held in Valencia, Spain, in September 2001, that reviewed ongoing international collaborations and the prospects for new collaborative research. The attendees represented nine different countries and many different specialties. Following overviews of existing international collaborations in South Africa, Russia, and Chile, a number of topics for future work were discussed. Issues related to the diagnosis of FAS, its prevalence and how measures might be enhanced and standardized were presented, as obtaining consistency across populations is of prime importance. Another session discussed the current state of basic research and how collaborations in this area might be initiated. The neurobehavioral profile of FAS and how work in this area could be advanced and interpreted in light of findings with different populations generated considerable discussion. There was a review of brain imaging data in FAS and how this might be utilized in assisting the diagnosis of FAS and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). A presentation on the utilization of international collaborations in defining the role of genetics in the etiology of FAS was included. Finally, issues related to the prevention of FAS and how these issues might be modified based upon different populations were presented. International collaborations provide a wealth of resources for the study of FAS, and it was hoped that this meeting might better enhance the work ongoing in this area, and provide opportunities for future work.

T1  - Biochemical markers of alcohol use in pregnant women
A1  - Cook J.D.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Objectives. To describe the serious health consequences of alcohol (ethanol) use, especially as they relate to pregnancy and the development of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE). The classic markers of alcohol exposure, including blood/breath alcohol, -glutamyl transferase (GT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hemoglobin-associated acetaldehyde (HAA) and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), are valuable and their methods of analysis are reviewed. Conclusions. Since both FAS and FAE represent two of the leading preventable causes of mental retardation and birth defects, identification of alcohol use early in pregnancy is important to avoid adverse fetal outcomes. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of FAS and FAE is usually made after birth, when alcohol damage has become irreversible and permanent. The clinical laboratory can help prevent this damage and make a valuable contribution in assessing prenatal alcohol use. The clinical utility of blood/breath alcohol, GT, MCV, HAA and CDT in alcohol use identification, especially in pregnancy, is substantial. Although none of the markers singularly has adequate sensitivity and specificity for screening, their diagnostic utility increases when measured as a panel. This is especially true in detecting alcohol use in pregnancy where the presence of several positive markers was correlated with the presence of alcohol-related fetal effects. © 2002 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Verbal Learning deficits have been reported following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). This study examined verbal and visual multitrial learning in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) and controls matched on age and gender from the same community. In this study, the FAS/FAE group's immediate memory on the Verbal Learning and Visual Learning tasks from the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML) was significantly weaker than that of the control group. Although the FAS/FAE group also recalled significantly less information after a delay, they did retain an equivalent proportion of the visual and verbal information as compared to the control group. Thus, the overall pattern of performance on both verbal and visual measures was consistent with that observed in previous studies of Verbal Learning: despite weaker learning, the FAS/FAE group's relative retention of information was no different than that of controls. © 2002 National Academy of Neuropsychology.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), and alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorders (ARNDs) in neonates are often the result of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Facial characteristics are associated with FAS, but ARBDs and ARNDs are more difficult to diagnose. Fetal exposure to alcohol can cause central nervous system dysfunction, pre- and postnatal growth problems, cardiac defects in neonates, and attention deficit disorders and mental retardation in older children. To date, diagnosis of fetal alcohol effect has depended largely on maternal interview, although clinical tests are becoming more widely used. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are formed in the body by esterification of ethanol with free fatty acids and trans-esterification of glycerides and have been detected in the meconium of newborns. This report estimates the prevalence of fetal alcohol exposure in two populations by detecting FAEEs in meconium. Methods: We analyzed the prevalence of FAEEs in the meconium of two separate groups of neonates by use of solid-phase extraction and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the chemical ionization mode. In the first study, meconium samples were taken anonymously from babies born in a large, regional perinatal center in Hawaii. In the second study, specimens were obtained from infants admitted to six different newborn intensive care units within the state of Utah. Results: In the first study, 73 of 436 (16.7%) meconium specimens tested were considered positive for FAEEs. When broken down into quartiles, the mean total FAEEs measured were 1059, 3133, 6628, and 62115 ng/g. In the second study, 35 of 289 (12.1%) specimens were considered positive. When broken into quartiles, the mean total FAEEs were 1139, 3067, 7674, and 50 143 ng/g. The overall FAEE profiles of the two study sets were remarkably similar. Conclusion: In an adequate meconium specimen, a total FAEE concentration >10 000 ng/g may indicate that the newborn has been exposed to significant amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. © 2003 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure is an important cause of growth impairment. In this study we examined the stability of the growth measurements, including height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) percentiles, from birth to age at the time of diagnosis for subjects who were referred for evaluation to determine if they had fetal alcohol syndrome. Methods: We utilized subjects from the North Dakota Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Registry. Each person referred for assessment was provided a standardized assessment completed by a medical geneticist. We also examined differences in the diagnostic schema from the Institute of Medicine. The population consisted of 315 subjects with paired weight measurements, 234 subjects with paired height measurements, and 322 subjects with current BMI measurements. Results: Increases in weight percentiles and decreases in height percentiles were found. Children with FAS had consistently lower growth measurements. There was significant movement in and out of lower 5th and 10th percentiles by partial and no FAS children from birth to diagnosis. Discussion: The requirement for growth impairment needs to be broad rather than narrow, if most subjects with a diagnosis of FAS and partial FAS/ARND are to be captured. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common cause of developmental disability, neuropsychiatric impairment and birth defects. The disorder is identified by the presence of growth impairment, central nervous system dysfunction, and a characteristic pattern of craniofacial features. The reported prevalence of the disorder varies widely and recent estimates approach 1% of live births. Expression of these features varies by age. People with FAS have high rates of comorbid conditions: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (40%), mental retardation (15-20%), learning disorders (25%), speech and language disorders (30%), sensory impairment (30%), cerebral palsy (4%), epilepsy (8-10%). Birth defects are common. In the United States, the annual birth cohort of persons with FAS could be as high as 39,000 cases annually. Cause-specific mortality is 6% for patients with FAS. The disorder is expensive to treat and most patients have lifelong impairment. The annual cost of care in the United States would approach US$5.0 billion. Early recognition and entry into appropriate treatment programs appear to improve outcome. Prevention efforts should involve screening for alcohol use prior to pregnancy and at the first prenatal care visit. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Four-State FAS Consortium: Model for program implementation and data collection
A1  - Struck J.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The Four-State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Consortium on the Studies of the Prevention of FAS is an effort to bring together resources, both human and material, across the states of Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota to decrease the prevalence of births affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Beginning in September 2000, the Consortium received 3 years of funding and operates through a cooperative agreement with funding from the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Three primary objectives are addressed through the Consortium structure. These include: to develop and evaluate the formation of the Consortium itself; to develop an information base that systematizes data collection that helps determine populations and areas considered high risk; and to implement and test a scientific-based prevention/intervention model for women considered high risk of abusing alcohol during their childbearing years. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction. The microdeletion 22q11.2 affects 1/4000 live births and constitutes the most frequent interstitial chromosomal alteration in humans. It is involved in a heterogeneous series of phenotypic expressions. Aims. To determine the most important clinical characteristics in a series of patients with this genetic-molecular disorder. Patients and methods. We conducted a retrospective study of 16 patients who had been diagnosed, by means ofFISHorPCR, as having microdeletion 22q11.2, and the following data were evaluated in a protocolised manner: sex, age, family background, characteristics of the pregnancy, birth, neonatal and post-neonatal periods, clinical and semiological data, as well as the results from the complementary explorations carried out according to the predominant pathology. Results. The age at which the diagnosis was made oscillated between newly born and 8 years, with a predominance of males overfemales in a ratio of 3.2/1. In all, 81% of patients presented neurological disorders. Brain malformations were seen in six, hypoplasia of the anguli oris muscle in five, congenital facial palsy in three-which was associated with brain malformations in one patient-, retarded neurodevelopment in six cases and neurogenic arthrogryposis in one. Other findings such as congenital heart disease (75%), skeletal disorders (37%), peculiar phenotypes (31%), nephrourological disorders (19%) and hypoacusis (19%) constitute significant manifestations of the process. Some of the most noteworthy occasional events include retarded height and weight development, hypocalcemia and cleft palate. In one case involving a child whose mother suffered from chronic alcoholism, there were both phenotypic traits of this entity and offoetal alcohol syndrome at the same time. In four of the patients the FISH teehnique did not detect the deletion, which was confirmed by a technique involving DNA amplification with PCR. Conclusions. The presence of central and peripheral neurological alterations, together with cardiac, skeletal, renal and auditory disorders was confirmed, as was the existence of neurodevelopmental retardation and a peculiar phenotype. Both the frequency and the kind of disorder coincided with what has been described earlier. A number of facts stand out owing to their novelty. These include the high incidence of asymmetric crying facies, the existence ofdata compatible with foetal alcohol syndrome in one of the patients with this clinical entity, and the association with neurogenic arthrogryposis in another, which are circumstances that suggest the possibility of a causal relation with the deletion 22q11.2. Using DNA amplification with PCR is seen to be of greater diagnostic efficacy than the FISH technique.

N2  - Background. Significant interindividual variability exists following maternal alcohol consumption; not all children born to alcoholic women manifest the symptoms associated with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objective. To investigate the potential role of the placenta as a source of variability by determining if interindividual variability exists in the binding of acetaldehyde to human placenta. Methods. Acetaldehyde was added to ten different human placental homogenates and subjected to equilibrium dialysis. Homogenates of placentae obtained from guinea pigs chronically exposed to ethanol throughout gestation were also dialysed in the presence of acetaldehyde to look for alterations in binding after chronic alcohol exposure. Nonlinear least-squares regression analysis was used to characterize the binding system involved. Results. It was found that the amount of acetaldehyde bound to human placentae varied by as much as 3-fold among placentae. The binding profile of acetaldehyde was characterized as a two site binding system (Ka1 = 9.8 x 105 +/- 0.7 x 105 l/mol, N1 = 1.1 x 10-8 +/- 0.7 x 10-8 mol/g tissue; Ka2 = 1.6 x 104 +/- 0.9 x 104 l/mol, N2 = 1.7 x 10-7 +/- 0.4 x 10-7 mol/g tissue). Chronic alcohol exposure had no effect on the degree of acetaldehyde binding. Conclusion. This previously unidentified source of variability may partially explain why some foetuses are adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure while others are not. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and type 2 diabetes occur with high incidence in the same populations and both are associated with autonomic neuropathies. The authors have recently shown that hepatic parasympathetic neuropathy results in insulin resistance of skeletal muscle. The authors tested the hypothesis that fetal ethanol exposure (FEE) results in hepatic insulin sensitizing substance (HISS)-dependent insulin resistance (HDIR) in the adult offspring of rats. The parasympathetic nerves normally provide a permissive signal to the liver, allowing insulin to cause the release of HISS, which stimulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Blockade of the neural signal prevents HISS release, and a state of HDIR ensues, whereby the response to insulin is reduced by 50 to 60% in the fed state. The rapid insulin sensitivity test (RIST), a transient euglycemic clamp, was used. The RIST index is the amount (mg) of glucose per kg of body weight required to maintain euglycemia following a bolus of insulin (50 mU/kg). Adult male offspring of dams who received ethanol through the maternal drinking water, throughout gestation and nursing, showed ethanol dose-related HDIR. The control RIST index of 195.3+/-5.5 mg glucose/kg body weight decreased progressively with maternal consumption of 5 to 20% vol/vol ethanol to 122.5+/-13.9 mg glucose/kg body weight in the 20% ethanol group. HISS-independent insulin action and the glucose disposal effect of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 were unaltered. FEE lead to insulin resistance completely attributable to ethanol dose-related suppression of HISS action (HDIR) in the adult male offspring. The possibility of the same relationship in humans requires evaluation.

N2  - Frequent alcohol drinking during pregnancy may result in facial dysmorphism, growth retardation and central nervous system deficits in infants ranging from Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). However, few studies has been done to empirical research the psychosomatic approach among women with FAE. In this study, twelve women with FAE infants were selected and interviewed at two or three days after delivery with CMI, MAS, and ANS-S, in order to elucidate the number of problems with mental health of them. All of women with FAE infants drank alcohol during the pregnancy consumed 2 or 3 drinks per week (ethanol consumption less than 92.0 gms per week). The mean mother's age of FAE infants is 30.2 years (range 27-35) and that of healthy mother is 30.3 years (range 24-35). Eleven of 12 (91.7%) infants were identified having the smooth philtrum, 9 (75.0%) with thin upper lip, 3 (25%) with hypersensitivity, 3 (25%) with sleeping disturbance, 2 (16.7%) with growth retardation. Eighty-three percent of infant with FAE had an adequate body weight and height. In comparison with the women without FAE, women with FAE infants were noted to have a significant difference of the score of CMI (p < 0.0001), MAS (p < 0.0001), ANS-S (p < 0.02). Psychosomatic interview revealed that women with FAE infants have increased anxiety neurosis and stress state. Seventy-five percent of women with FAE infants had an anxiety compared with control group (18.8%). Our findings in this study are important because 12 women with FAE infants were not alcoholics and did not consider themselves to have alcohol problems. Therefore, obstetrician has to cut down women alcohol intake considerably during pregnancy for preventing adverse fetal effects. Alcohol consumption and psychometric works also need to be done for detecting at risk use of alcohol during the pregnancy.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to serious birth defects and developmental disabilities. A need exists to develop effective strategies for both children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or other prenatal alcohol-related effects and for women at high risk for having an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Since the syndrome was identified approximately 30 years ago, advancements have been made in FAS diagnostics, surveillance, prevention, and intervention, but a substantial amount of work remains. Collaborations among partners in federal state, and local agencies, academia, clinical professions, school systems, and families are critical to developing and implementing successful efforts related to FAS and fetal alcohol effect (FAE). In 1999, Congress directed the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to convene the National Task Force on FAS and FAE (the Task Force). CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Team, coordinates the Task Force and manages its operation. Since the Task Force was chartered in 2000, Task Force members, with input from multiple partners, have convened to deliberate and determine the Task Force mission, goals, and priority concerns to be addressed. This report describes the structure, function, mission, and goals of the Task Force and provides their first recommendations. An explanation of how the Task Force recommendations were generated and the Task Forces next steps are also reported.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol often induces birth defects that combine morphological stigmata with neurological or neuropsychological deficits. But it has proved problematic to diagnose these syndromes in adolescents and adults, in whom the morphological signs are absent or attenuated, the behavioral deficits nonspecific, and the exposure history often difficult to reconstruct. Localizing the associated brain abnormalities might circumvent most of these difficulties. To this end, three-dimensional (3D) locations were recorded for 67 homologous points on or near the corpus callosum in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images from 60 adolescents and adults who were normal, 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, and 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol effects. We combined the standard statistical approach to this type of geometric data, Procrustes analysis, with a multivariate strategy focusing on differences in variability. In this data set, the shape of the corpus callosum and its vicinity proves systematically much more variable in the alcohol-affected brains than in those of the normal subjects. From this excess variability follows a promising classification rule, having both high sensitivity (100 out of 117) and high specificity (49 out of 60) in this sample. The discrimination uses four landmark points and two summary scores of callosal outline shape. The information from the corpus callosum and vicinity, as viewed in MR brain images of full-grown subjects, may serve as a permanent record of the prenatal effects of alcohol, even in patients who are first suspected of these syndromes relatively late in life or who lack the facial signs of prenatal alcohol damage. The statistical pattern underlying the callosal diagnosis also leads to speculations on mechanisms of the prenatal damage. Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have numerous adverse health consequences for the developing fetus, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related effects, and therefore is a significant public health problem. A variety of programs have been developed to prevent drinking during pregnancy and the resulting health problems. Some of these efforts, such as public service announcements and beverage warning labels, are universal and strive to increase the public's knowledge about FAS. Selective prevention approaches target women of reproductive age who drink alcohol. Such approaches may involve screening all pregnant women for alcohol consumption and counseling those women who do drink. Indicated prevention approaches target high-risk women (e.g., women who have previously abused alcohol or have had a child with FAS or other alcohol-related effects) and typically offer repeated counseling over several years. Both selective and indicated prevention efforts can reduce maternal alcohol consumption and improve the outcome of the offspring.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome--Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, and New York, 1995-1997
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. FAS is diagnosed on the basis of a combination of growth deficiency (pre- or postnatal), central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, facial dysmorphology, and maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Estimates of the prevalence of FAS vary from 0.2 to 1.0 per 1,000 live-born infants. This variation is due, in part, to the small size of the populations studied, varying case definitions, and different surveillance methods. In addition, differences have been noted among racial/ethnic populations. To monitor the occurrence of FAS, CDC collaborated with five states (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, New York, and Wisconsin*) to develop the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network (FASSNet). This report summarizes the results of an analysis of FASSNet data on children born during 1995-1997, which indicate that FAS rates in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, and New York ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 per 1,000 live-born infants and were highest for black and American Indian/Alaska Native populations. This study demonstrates that FASSNet is a useful tool that enables health care professionals to monitor the occurrence of FAS and to evaluate the impact of prevention, education, and intervention efforts.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a collection of signs and symptoms seen in children of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. With the increasing incidence of FAS, there is a great variation of its clinical features different from that described in the standard textbooks. This article aims to report on the unusual clinical features of FAS. It also aims to explain the mechanism of action of alcohol as a teratogenic agent.

T1  - The Toronto experience in diagnosing alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder: A unique profile of deficits and assets

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which involves the triad of features reflecting facial dysmorphology, growth retardation and intellectual impairments, encompasses a relatively small proportion of the children affected prenatally by alcohol. Unfortunately, in the absence of facial dysmorphology, the diagnosis is difficult in the majority of children, who are considered to have alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Because accepted clinical methods are not pathognomonic, a novel profile approach was used to examine neuropsychological abilities and disabilities to identify children with ARND who do not meet the diagnostic criteria of FAS. OBJECTIVE: To establish a set of criteria, to be validated in future studies, for characterizing the neuropsychological profile of children with ARND. By describing the procedures at this preliminary stage of our work, the goal is to draw attention to this neglected topic and to suggest a model that can be replicated and validated by others, and to provide the first systematic clinical report on diagnosing ARND in Canada. PROCEDURES: On the basis of the literature, parents' descriptions and the authors' own experience with ARND, a profile of neuropsychological characteristics, including both deficits and assets, that are associated with prenatal alcohol exposure was hypothesized. A group of children was then evaluated, mostly adoptees or children in foster care, who were referred for learning and behavioural problems potentially associated with gestational exposure. Their results were submitted to a profile analysis by comparing their deficits and assets according to a list describing a hypothetical ARND profile to determine whether each child fit or did not fit the ARND profile. Groups were compared for background characteristics, FAS symptomatology, and results on specific neuropsychological and behavioural tests. Finally, the characteristics most strongly differentiating the two groups were identified. SETTING: Hospital-based outpatient program. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two children aged four to 18 years who were referred for a diagnostic assessment related to suspected or known prenatal alcohol exposure. OUTCOME MEASURES: Each child's assessment results were compared against a list of 21 deficits and six assets by two independent raters. Children with an average of more than 60% deficits and 50% assets were considered to have ARND, while the remainder were not. RESULTS: Twenty-eight children (54%) were assigned to the ARND group and 24 to the non-ARND group. The groups did not differ in physical features or home background characteristics, with the exception of higher parental intelligence quotient in the non-ARND group. The ARND group was more likely to have repeated a grade or received special education and scored lower on standardized measures of intelligence, language and memory abilities. Frequency of behaviour or social problems were equivalent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A profile approach used to identify children with ARND discriminates problems in neuropsychological but not behavioural domains. Because elevated scores on behavioural tasks in both ARND and non-ARND groups were clinically significant, more research is needed to identify what behavioural problems are unique to children with ARND compared with other clinic-referred children.

T1  - Interhemispheric transfer in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Roebuck T.M.
A1  - Mattson S.N.
A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has long been associated with alterations in brain structure and behavioral changes. The corpus callosum can be affected by heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, and agenesis (absence) of this structure occurs more often in children with fetal alcohol syndrome than in the general population or in other developmentally delayed populations. Although the majority of children with fetal alcohol syndrome do not have agenesis of the corpus callosum, callosal area is reduced in this population, particularly in the anterior and posterior regions. However, the functional implication of these size reductions has not been examined. Methods: The current study used a finger localization task to measure the transfer of information across the corpus callosum in children and adolescents with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and age- and sex-matched controls. In a subset of children, correlational analysis was also conducted between behavioral data and cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum. Results: When compared with nonexposed controls, alcohol-exposed children made more errors on trials for which information had to cross the corpus callosum ("crossed" trials) than on trials for which it did not ("uncrossed" trials), and they also made more errors as the task increased in complexity. Additionally, correlations with magnetic resonance imaging data in a subset of children revealed that impairment in interhemispheric transfer was related to reductions in the size of the corpus callosum. These correlations were independent of effects expected from the relationship between corpus callosum size and general intellectual functioning alone. Conclusions: These findings suggest that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure display subtle deficits in the interhemispheric transfer of information in the somatosensory domain. Such deficits in interhemispheric transfer are likely to be related to the myriad of other behavioral and cognitive impairments observed in these children.

N2  - Alcohol is a known teratogenic substance that operates under a dose-response mechanism. Before we conducted a larger study that examines the use of alcohol both before pregnancy and during pregnancy, it was important to pilot our method for measuring a pregnant mother's alcohol use that would allow us to capture the number of drinks consumed per day while addressing recall bias. The purpose of this study was 1) to pilot the Time Line Followback (TLFB) method developed by Sobell and Sobell (1992, Measuring Alcohol Use. Totowa, NJ: Humana Press) as a method for examining alcohol use during pregnancy and 2) to determine if the use of a study protocol that included biological markers of alcohol use would affect our ability to recruit subjects. Using a descriptive design, we tested our protocol for collecting alcohol use data with 10 mothers receiving prenatal care. We measured alcohol use using the TLFB method (Sobell and Sobell, 1992, Measuring Alcohol Use. Totowa, NJ: Humana Press, 1996). We also collected collected biological blood markers for heavy alcohol use. Of the 10 maternal subjects we recruited, 5 mothers (50%) reported alcohol use during pregnancy. We successfully recruited 10 out of 11 mothers approached and had a 100% retention rate for the second interview. The TLFB method is viable for measuring fetal alcohol exposure over the pregnancy, and the collection of blood samples did not impact our ability to recruit or retain mothers.

N2  - We determined the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a foster care population and evaluated the performance of the FAS Facial Photographic Screening Tool. All children enrolled in a Washington State Foster Care Passport Program were screened for three conditions: (1) the FAS facial phenotype from a photograph, (2) evidence of brain damage with prenatal alcohol exposure from their Health and Education passport, and/or (3) other syndromes identifiable from a facial photograph. Screen-positives received diagnostic evaluations at a FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network clinic. The prevalence of FAS in this foster care population was 10 to 15/1000, or 10 to 15 times greater than in the general population. The screening tool performed with 100% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity, 85.7% predictive value positive, and 100% predictive value negative. We conclude that the foster care population is a high-risk population for FAS. The screening tool performed with very high accuracy and could be used to track FAS prevalence over time in foster care to accurately assess the effectiveness of primary prevention efforts.

N2  - Background: Growth deficits are among the cardinal features for the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. Growth deficits have also been noted among those who were exposed to alcohol prenatally but who do not have fetal alcohol syndrome. Few studies have observed subjects past early and middle childhood, however, to evaluate the longer-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth in adolescence. This is a report of the effects of alcohol exposure during gestation on the size of the offspring at 14 years of age. Methods: Women were recruited in their fourth prenatal month. These women were interviewed in the fourth and seventh months of pregnancy and at delivery. The women and their children were seen when the offspring were 14 years of age. Results: Growth deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were identified among the offspring at 14 years of age. Weight, height, head circumference, and skinfold thickness continued to be significantly affected by prenatal alcohol exposure after controlling for other significant predictors of size. These effects exhibited a dose-response pattern, and significant effects were found at levels below one drink per day. For example, first trimester alcohol exposure predicted weights of 152 lbs for the offspring of abstainers, 149 lbs for the offspring of light drinkers (>0 and <0.2 drinks per day), 143 lbs for the offspring of moderate drinkers (>0.2 and <0.89 drinks per day), and 136 lbs for the offspring of heavy drinkers (>0.89 drinks per day). Conclusions: Prenatal alcohol exposure continues to affect size at age 14 years in this cohort of children followed since their fourth month of gestation.

N2  - Serotonin (5-HT) has specific roles not only as a transmitter but also as a signal for differentiation. We recently found that alcohol drinking during pregnancy resulted in incomplete neural tube fusion which hindered the development of midline cells such as 5-HT neurons in mice. We now report that, at the birth of 5-HT neurons (E11), the 5-HT immunoreactive (5-HT-im) neurons are often found missing medial projecting fibers towards ventricle in the Alcohol treated group (ALC) as compared with pair-fed (PF) and Chow-fed groups (Chow) in mice. At E13, there are fewer 5-HT-im neurons in either dorsal or median raphe of ALC as compared with PF or Chow; furthermore, neurite outgrowth and migration of the 5-HT neurons are also compromised with alcohol exposure. We, thus, demonstrated that fetal alcohol exposure compromised 5-HT development as early as at the 5-HT neuron birth. Since 5-HT is a signal for development of many forebrain neurons, the deviation of 5-HT in early life may have consequences on brain development that extend beyond those seen in the 5-HT system.

T1  - Ethanol induces morphological and dynamic changes on in vivo and in vitro neural crest cells
A1  - Rovasio R.A.
A1  - Battiato N.L.
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is an embryopathology related to maternal alcohol drinking. The information concerning the factors involved in the prenatal mechanisms of ethanol action at the cellular and molecular levels is scarce. Because several abnormal changes in FAS involve regions colonized by cell lineages derived from neural crest cells (NCCs), it is reasonable to propose that epigenetic alteration of this cell population can represent an important component of the etiopathogeny. The aim of this work was to evaluate the direct effect of ethanol on a chick embryo model, as well as on in vitro NCC morphology and dynamic behavior. Methods: After ethanol treatment, in ovo or cultured chick embryos were used to determine the anatomical development of and to quantify the migratory parameters and apoptosis of NCCs. Scanning electron microscopy was performed on ethanol-perfused (and control) cultures of cephalic and trunk NCCs; the actin cytoskeleton was evaluated, and morphometric and dynamic parameters were determined after time-lapse videorecording. Recovery capacity after ethanol treatment was also determined. Results: Chick embryos submitted to conditions sufficient to induce FAS in mammals displayed developmental disruptions frequently accompanied by cephalic/facial anomalies. In vitro studies also indicated that cephalic and trunk NCCs exposed to ethanol exhibited significant and permanent changes regarding cell shape, surface morphology, apoptotic cell death, cytoskeleton, and distance and velocity traveled, as well as an abnormal pattern of migration. Conclusions: Taking into account that even a limited period of abnormal behavior may imply serious consequences in the final cues of an embryonic cell population, our results indicate that the biological effects of ethanol on early development - even during a short time - could induce permanent ontogenetic perturbations of NCCs, with potentially dramatic effects on embryonic morphogenesis. These results support an important participation of NCCs in the etiopathogeny of FAS.

There is great variability of behavioral deficits within these groups. We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with neurocognitive and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over the variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline curves of the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions from T1-weighted MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15 with FAE, and 15 who were unexposed and clinically normal. From 5 h of neuropsychological testing we extracted 260 scores and ratings pertaining to attention, memory, executive function, fine and gross motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline shape was analyzed by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to behavior by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly more variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With the excess shape variation are associated two different profiles of behavioral deficit unrelated to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE distinction within the exposed subgroup. A relatively thick callosum is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive function; one that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed from the unexposed in this sample. Thus there is considerable information in callosal form for prognosis of neuropsychological deficits in this frequently encountered birth defect. © 2002 Elsevier Science.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol often induces birth defects that combine morphological stigmata with neurological or neuropsychological deficits. But it has proved problematic to diagnose these syndromes in adolescents and adults, in whom the morphological signs are absent or attenuated, the behavioral deficits nonspecific, and the exposure history often difficult to reconstruct. Localizing the associated brain abnormalities might circumvent most of these difficulties. To this end, three-dimensional (3D) locations were recorded for 67 homologous points on or near the corpus callosum in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images from 60 adolescents and adults who were normal, 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, and 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol effects. We combined the standard statistical approach to this type of geometric data, Procrustes analysis, with a multivariate strategy focusing on differences in variability. In this data set, the shape of the corpus callosum and its vicinity proves systematically much more variable in the alcohol-affected brains than in those of the normal subjects. From this excess variability follows a promising classification rule, having both high sensitivity (100 out of 117) and high specificity (49 out of 60) in this sample. The discrimination uses four landmark points and two summary scores of callosal outline shape. The information from the corpus callosum and vicinity, as viewed in MR brain images of full-grown subjects, may serve as a permanent record of the prenatal effects of alcohol, even in patients who are first suspected of these syndromes relatively late in life or who lack the facial signs of prenatal alcohol damage. The statistical pattern underlying the callosal diagnosis also leads to speculations on mechanisms of the prenatal damage. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Memory deficits are reported commonly in children with fetal alcohol syndrome. However, little, is known about nonverbal memory performance in this population. Methods: The current study examined learning and memory abilities in alcohol-exposed children and nonexposed controls. Multiple verbal and nonverbal measures were used that incorporated repeated learning trials and delayed recall trials. The alcohol-exposed group included children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with and without fetal alcohol syndrome. Children ranged in age from 8 to 16 years, and groups were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure displayed deficits in learning and recall of verbal and nonverbal information across all measures. On learning trials, they recalled fewer words and displayed a lower rate of acquisition. However, when we analyzed delayed verbal recall data after controlling for initial verbal learning, group differences were not apparent. The same pattern did not occur for nonverbal information; children with prenatal alcohol exposure recalled less on delayed recall even when we accounted for initial learning. Conclusions: These data are consistent with previous studies that indicate immediate memory deficits but suggest that, at least for verbal information, delayed recall deficits in this population are better accounted for by deficits in initial learning. Importantly, a different pattern of results was demonstrated for verbal versus nonverbal information, which suggests the need for additional research in this area.

N2  - Alcohol is a physical and behavioural teratogen. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common yet under-recognized condition resulting from maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. While preventable, FAS is also disabling. Although FAS is found in all socioeconomic groups in Canada, it has been observed at high prevalence in select First Nations and Inuit communities in Canada. This statement addresses FAS prevention, diagnosis, early identification and management for health care professionals. Prevention of FAS must occur at two levels. Primary prevention involves eliminating FAS through classroom or community education, and encouraging women to avoid consuming alcohol before conception and throughout pregnancy. Secondary prevention involves identifying women who are drinking while pregnant and reducing their consumption. This statement describes a variety of screening strategies including Tolerance-Annoyance, Cut Down, Eye Opener (T-ACE). Medical practitioners should recommend abstinence starting with the first prenatal visit. Prompt referral for alcohol treatment is recommended for pregnant individuals who are unable to stop drinking alcohol. This statement describes the diagnosis of FAS, partial or atypical FAS, alcohol-related birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. With a history of in-utero alcohol exposure, a diagnosis of FAS should be considered with current or previous growth deficiency, select facial abnormalities involving the upper lip and eyes, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. These features are best quantified with the use of a four-digit diagnostic method. Strategies for early identification of possible alcohol-related abnormalities are outlined. Intervention focuses on optimizing development, managing behavioural difficulties and providing appropriate school programming. Of prime importance is earliest possible childhood intervention to prevent secondary disabilities that may result from delay while awaiting a definitive diagnosis of FAS.

N2  - Objective: Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) births were examined as part of a larger epidemiologic study of FAS in a community in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Method: Using retrospective case-control methodology, 31 mothers who had given birth to FAS children 6 to 9 years previously were compared with 31 matched controls on a variety of demographic, socioeconomic, drinking, family and maternity variables. Descriptive analyses were utilized to determine major differential characteristics between the two groups. Results: In this community with a very high rate of FAS and rather uniform low socioeconomic status, the two groups were found to be comparable with respect to age, annual income, ethnic background, age of initiation of regular drinking, age at birth of the index child, gravidity and parity. However, mothers of FAS children reported initiating drinking at an earlier age, as well as reporting higher rates of heavy alcohol consumption in their extended family, current use of alcohol, drinking before and during pregnancy, and smoking of tobacco (percentage who smoke) during each trimester of the pregnancy. Mothers of FAS children had lower educational attainment and reported lower religiosity than control mothers. Conclusions: This study in South Africa draws upon the experience of mothers of 31 children with FAS to confirm many of the same high-risk variables identified in maternal risk studies in the United States and Europe. Some factors associated with less maternal alcohol abuse in this high-risk population were also identified, which may be helpful for implementing prevention in this region as well as in other developing countries.

N2  - This study examined 17 children (nine males, eight females; mean age 13 years) with prenatal alcohol exposure of various durations. The aim of the study was to detect specific brain morphological alterations by means of MRI and to see if findings correlated with particular cognitive deficits. Of the 17 children, five had been exposed to heavy maternal consumption of alcohol (over 10 drinks/week) during the first trimester only; four had been exposed during the first and second trimester; and eight had been exposed throughout pregnancy. Five children had alcohol related neurobehavioural disorder, seven were diagnosed as having foetal alcohol effects and five were diagnosed as having foetal alcohol syndrome. Hypoplasia of the vermis was observed in 10 children and malformed posterior vermis in one additional child. Five children had hypoplastic cerebellar hemispheres. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum was observed in two children. Small hippocampi were observed in three children and wide cortical sulci in six. No specific structural anomaly correlated with a particular neuropsychological deficit. In this study, deviations in the development of the vermis was the most sensitive morphological indicator of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It was seen in every diagnostic group including children who had been exposed during only the first trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - The question of whether psychosocial stress during pregnancy (alone or in combination with fetal alcohol exposure) has negative consequences for offspring has not been clearly established in human studies. In this article, we present an overview of three prospective longitudinal studies. Using rhesus monkeys as subjects, a noise or hormone stressor, alone or in combination with moderate level alcohol solution, was presented daily during different stages of pregnancy. Prenatal stress resulted in lighter birth weights in two of three studies, and males from the alcohol plus noise stress condition had reduced birth weights. There were no significant effects of any of the prenatal treatments on gestation duration. Both prenatal stress and moderate fetal alcohol exposure reduced attention span and neuromotor capabilities of offspring during the first month of life, while early gestation prenatal stress, during the period of neuronal migration, emerged as a period of enhanced vulnerability for these effects. Under conditions of challenge, prenatally stressed monkeys showed more disturbance behaviors and reduced locomotion and exploration as well as altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to stress. Fetal alcohol exposed monkeys also showed increased HPA axis activity in response to stressful conditions. Finally, altered patterns of alcohol consumption during adolescence were associated with prenatal stress. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Exposure during pregnancy to alcohol (ethanol) produces a number of adverse effects. One of them is fetal alcohol syndrome. The hallmark of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is craniofacial dysmorphism and the changes in craniofacial measurement are dependent on the alcoholic dose and its time of exposure. Since prenatal ethanol exposure can alter craniofacial development in rodents and reliably produce long-term behavioral effect in them, the present study was designed to extend the same changes in the Sprague Dawley species. METHODS: The albino rat was studied to determine whether gestational exposure to alcohol (Ethanol) produces permanent craniofacial effect. On gestational day (GD7-10) 25% ethanol was injected intraperitoneally to pregnant rats. Various dimensions for skull and face of adult male rats were taken. RESULTS: Both vertical and coronal dimensions were altered in the exposed animals. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that exposure to ethanol on a critical gestational period produces permanent craniofacial defects.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Since the late 1970s, many studies have reported on the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (ARND). The three main types of research methods used in these studies are passive surveillance, clinic-based studies, and active case ascertainment. This article describes each of these methods, including their strengths and weaknesses, and summarizes the estimated prevalence of FAS produced by each of these approaches. The maternal risk factors associated with FAS and other alcohol-related anomalies include advanced maternal age, low socioeconomic status, frequent binge drinking, family and friends with drinking problems, and poor social and psychological indicators. Overall, the available literature points to a prevalence rate of FAS of 0.5 to 2 cases per 1,000 births in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s.

N2  - In 1994 Alcohol Health & Research World (now titled Alcohol Research & Health) last devoted a full issue to the topic of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). This introductory article provides readers with information on how the field has advanced since then. In addition to tracing the development of the terminology used in the field, it describes the difficulties involved in determining the true prevalence of FAS and ARBD; the mechanisms that may play a role in alcohol-derived fetal injuries; approaches to preventing drinking during pregnancy; and strategies for assisting people who have been born with FAS and ARBD.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is often associated with cardiac hypertrophy and impaired ventricular function in a manner similar to postnatal chronic alcohol ingestion. Chronic alcoholism has been shown to lead to hypomagnesemia, and dietary Mg2+ supplementation was shown to ameliorate ethanol-induced cardiovascular dysfunction such as hypertension. However, the role of gestational Mg2+ supplementation on FAS-related cardiac dysfunction is unknown. This study was conducted to examine the influence of gestational dietary Mg2+ supplementation on prenatal ethanol exposure-induced cardiac contractile response at the ventricular myocyte level. Timed-pregnancy female rats were fed from gestation day 2 with liquid diets containing 0.13 g/L Mg2+ supplemented with ethanol (36%) or additional Mg2+ (0.52 g/L), or both. The pups were maintained on standard rat chow through adulthood, and ventricular myocytes were isolated and stimulated to contract at 0.5 Hz. Mechanical properties were evaluated using an IonOptix soft-edge system, and intracellular Ca2+ transients were measured as changes in fura-2 fluorescence intensity (DELTAFFI). Offspring from all groups displayed similar growth curves. Myocytes from the ethanol group exhibited reduced cell length, enhanced peak shortening (PS), and shortened time to 90% relengthening (TR90) associated with a normal DELTAFFI and time to PS (TPS). Mg2+ reverted the prenatal ethanol-induced alteration in PS and maximal velocity of relengthening. However, it shortened TPS and TR90, and altered the DELTAFFI, as well as Ca2+ decay rate by itself. Additionally, myocytes from the ethanol group exhibited impaired responsiveness to increased extracellular Ca 2+ or stimulating frequency, which were restored by gestational Mg2+ supplementation. These data suggest that although gestational Mg2+ supplementation may be beneficial to certain cardiac contractile dysfunctions in offspring of alcoholic mothers, caution must be taken, as Mg2+ supplementation affects cell mechanics itself.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Although high-dose prenatal alcohol exposure is related to cognitive and behavioral impairments in children and adolescents with fetal alcohol syndrome, there is relatively little research on the effects of moderate drinking during pregnancy. We examined learning, memory, and behavior in adolescent rhesus monkeys prenatally exposed to moderate levels of alcohol, psychological stress, or both alcohol and stress. Methods: Forty adolescent rhesus monkey subjects were derived from four groups of female rhesus monkeys that (1) consumed alcohol throughout gestation; (2) experienced prenatal stress; (3) experienced prenatal stress and alcohol consumption; or (4) control group (no alcohol, no stress). The subjects were assessed for number of trials required to reach 90% criterion of correct responses on nonmatching-tosample task (NMS), followed by trials with delays of 30, 60, or 120 sec. Ratings of behavior during testing were made after each session. Results: Subjects exposed to moderate prenatal alcohol required significantly more trials to reach criterion on the acquisition phase of the NMS task but had no difficulty with delays. Prenatally stressed monkeys showed lower response inhibition or less behavioral restraint, whereas prenatal alcohol plus stress monkeys showed higher activity level and stereotypies compared with controls. High scores on neonatal measures of orientation (attending to novel stimuli) and motor maturity and low scores on irritability, activity, stereotypies, and impulsivity during acquisition were correlated with fewer trials to criterion on acquisition of NMS. Conclusions: NMS trials required to reach criterion and behavior during testing are sensitive to moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure in monkeys. The most adverse behavioral outcomes (hyperactivity and stereotypies) were associated with prenatal alcohol plus stress, raising concerns that environmental stress might provide the context within which fetal alcohol exposure could promote adverse behavioral outcomes. These effects occurred in the absence of either facial deformities or retarded physical growth.

N2  - PURPOSE: Heavy maternal drinking during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome, but whether more moderate alcohol consumption is associated with such adverse pregnancy outcomes as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) remains controversial. METHODS: Using data from a case-control study, we examined the association between maternal alcohol consumption and risk for IUGR among 701 case and 336 control infants born during 1993-1995 in Monroe County, New York. RESULTS: Our results provide no evidence of an independent association between moderate maternal alcohol consumption (<14 drinks per week) and risk for IUGR. The risk for IUGR among heavy drinkers (>14 drinks per week) around the time of conception was OR = 1.4 (95% CI 0.7-2.6) for IUGR < 5th percentile and OR = 1.4 (95% CI 0.7-2.8) for IUGR 5th-10th percentile. For heavy drinkers during the first trimester, the OR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.4-4.5) for IUGR < 5th percentile and OR = 1.3 (95% CI 0.4-4.8) for IUGR 5th-10th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: Since IUGR is a heterogeneous outcome with a possible multifactorial origin, further studies are needed to examine the combined effects of alcohol and other environmental and genetic factors on IUGR risk for subgroups of IUGR. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose was to demonstrate that an objective, multivariate case definition of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) can be derived by means of craniofacial anthropometry. Study design: Craniofacial measurements (n = 21) were taken of 100 individuals who had been exposed to alcohol before birth (41 FAS, 59 PFAS) and 31 members of a control group. Multivariate discriminant analysis was used to identify craniofacial measurements that best differentiated the 3 groups (FAS, PFAS, and control). Results: Both the FAS and PFAS groups had a unique craniofacial phenotype that could be accurately discriminated from that of the control group. Stepwise discriminant analysis identified 6 craniofacial measurements that could differentiate individuals with and without prenatal alcohol exposure with 96% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 90% specificity. Conclusions: individuals with FAS and PFAS have a distinctive facial phenotype that can be characterized anthropometrically. The phenotypic case definition could be used as a screening tool to identify individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol who do not exhibit a "classic" FAS phenotype but exhibit a more subtle craniofacial dysmorphia.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - It is not known why some heavy-drinking women give birth to children with alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) whereas others do not. The objective of this study was to determine whether the frequency of elevated maternal blood acetaldehyde levels among alcoholics is in the range of ARBD among alcoholic women. MEDLINE was searched from 1980 to 2000 using the key words acetaldehyde, pharmacokinetics, and alcoholism for controlled trials reporting blood or breath acetaldehyde levels in alcoholics and nonalcoholics. Separately, using the key words fetal alcohol syndrome, epidemiology, prevalence, incidence, and frequency, articles were identified reporting ARBD incidences among the offspring of heavy drinkers. Of 23 articles reporting acetaldehyde levels in alcoholics, four met the inclusion criteria. Forty-three studies reported on the rate of ARBD in heavy drinkers, and 14 were accepted. Thirty-four percent of heavy drinkers had a child with ARBD, and 43% of chronic alcoholics had high acetaldehyde levels. The similar frequencies of high acetaldehyde levels among alcoholics and the rates of ARBD among alcoholic women provide epidemiologic support to the hypothesis that acetaldehyde may play a major role in the cause of ARBD.

N2  - Background: Abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC) have been documented in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), ranging from subtle decrements in its size to partial and even complete agenesis. Prenatal exposure to alcohol is also known to result in neurocognitive deficits. Objective: To 1) investigate abnormalities in size, shape, and location of the CC within the brain in individuals with FAS and in those exposed to high amounts of alcohol prenatally but without FAS (PEA group); and 2) determine if there is a relationship between callosal dysmorphology and cognitive test performance. Methods: MRI and novel surface-based image analytic methods were used. Twenty alcohol-exposed subjects (8 to 22 years) along with 21 normal controls (8 to 25 years) were studied with high-resolution MRI and measures of verbal learning and visuospatial abilities. Results: In addition to callosal area reductions, most severe in the splenium, the CC is significantly displaced in patients exposed to alcohol prenatally. In the alcohol-exposed group, this structure lies more anterior and inferior in posterior regions with relatively normal localization of anterior regions. These findings are significant in the FAS group, and a similar but less severe pattern is observed in the PEA patients. The authors show that the amount of CC displacement is correlated with impairment in verbal learning ability and that CC displacement is a better predictor of verbal learning than regional CC area. The brain-behavior relationship is only significant within the alcohol-exposed group, and the effect is not solely mediated by overall impaired verbal intellectual functioning. Conclusions: These results further emphasize the vulnerability of midline brain structures to prenatal alcohol exposure.

A1  - West J.R.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts motor performance in affected offspring. The ventrolateral nucleus (VLN) of the thalamus functions to relay information between the cerebellum and motor cortex. Reductions in the size of the thalamus have been found in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, and therefore a rat model system was used to determine whether VLN size and neuronal number were altered by alcohol exposure during development. Methods: Rat pups were exposed to alcohol in utero during the first 10 days of gestation (first trimester equivalent), the second 10 days of gestation (second trimester equivalent), or the first two trimesters equivalent combined. Some pups were exposed to alcohol in utero during the time of VLN neurogenesis. In addition, offspring from some of the dams treated during the first two trimesters equivalent were reared artificially from postnatal day (P) 4 through P9 (part of the third trimester equivalent) and received binge-like alcohol during this time, resulting in offspring exposed to alcohol during all three trimesters equivalent. Other offspring from untreated dams were reared in the same manner but received alcohol only during the third trimester equivalent. Control animals (nutritional and untreated) were reared for all treatment conditions. All pups were perfused on P10. Results: A unique effect of alcohol treatment was not found for the VLN volume or the number of neural cells within the VLN. However, the period of VLN neurogenesis was found to be sensitive to both alcohol and nutritional control treatments, resulting in significant decreases in the VLN volume and neural cell number. Conclusions: Motor deficits seen in offspring exposed prenatally to alcohol do not seem to result from direct effects on the structure of the VLN of the thalamus.

N2  - Two peptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (ADNF-9)], that are associated with novel glial proteins regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, are shown now to provide protective intervention in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal demise and growth restrictions were produced after intraperitoneal injection of ethanol to pregnant mice during midgestation (E8). Death and growth abnormalities elicited by alcohol treatment during development are believed to be associated, in part, with severe oxidative damage. NAP and ADNF-9 have been shown to exhibit antioxidative and antiapoptotic actions in vitro. Pretreatment with an equimolar combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities. Pretreatment with NAP alone resulted in a significant decrease in alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas ADNF-9 alone had no detectable effect on fetal survival after alcohol exposure, indicating a pharmacological distinction between the peptides. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with 1-h post-alcohol administration. Bioavailability studies with [3H]NAPVSIPQ indicated that 39% of the total radioactivity comigrated with intact peptide in the fetus 60 min after administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.

N2  - Objective: Executive function deficits, including verbal fluency, have been documented in children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure. Whereas nonverbal fluency impairments have been reported in adults with such exposure, these abilities have not been tested in children. Deficits in both verbal and nonverbal fluency were predicted and assessed in children and adolescents with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Method: There was a total of 28 (54% female) sub children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with (n = 10) and without (n = 8) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were compared to nonexposed controls (n = 10) on the design and verbal fluency measures from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System. Both fluency measures consist of three conditions, including a new set-shifting task. All tests require the generation of multiple responses within both rule and time constraints. Results: Data were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance and hierarchical regression analyses. Compared to controls, children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with and without FAS displayed deficits in both fluency domains, but did not differ from each other. In addition, prenatal alcohol exposure was a significant predictor of performance on the set-shifting design fluency task above and beyond performance on more traditional fluency tasks. IQ was not a significant predictor for the traditional or set-shifting fluency measures, whereas diagnostic group remained a significant predictor when IQ was included in the model. Conclusions: This study adds to the literature on the integrity of executive functions in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, documenting fluency impairment in both verbal and nonverbal domains. It is important to note that these impairments were demonstrated in higher functioning alcohol-exposed children, both with and without FAS, and that diagnostic group explained such deficiencies above and beyond general intellectual ability.

N2  - The association between deficits in emotion-related learning, conceptual set shifting, and behavioral problems was investigated in individuals with substantial prenatal alcohol exposure. Twenty subjects with confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (10 of whom were diagnosed as having Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) and 20 normal controls matched for age, gender, and ethnic background participated. The two groups were administered a battery of tests including two tests of emotion-related learning (visual discrimination reversal and extinction of reward-response associations), tests of conceptual set shifting and intellectual ability, and behavioral measures. The alcohol-exposed group made fewer reversals than the control group in visual discrimination reversal and exhibited more variability in extinction. These group differences remained significant after controlling for intellectual ability and conceptual set shifting. Variability in extinction and two measures of set shifting, perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and omission errors on reversal learning, were found to be robust predictors of parent-rated behavioral problems.

T1  - Pregnancy and drinking: "If it burns going down...": How focus groups can shape fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) prevention
A1  - Branco E.I.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Despite public health campaigns and clinical interventions that encourage women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy, some women continue to drink while pregnant. To provide a more in-depth understanding of how at-risk women regard - and emotionally react to - warnings about drinking alcohol during pregnancy, we conducted focus groups in 1997 with 11 pregnant and recent postpartum Native American and African American women in Los Angeles, California. The main objective of these groups was to uncover relevant aspects of women's beliefs and opinions about drinking during pregnancy that may not have been elicited by other research instruments. Results would then be used to shape a large survey of pregnant at-risk women. Analysis of the transcripts revealed three emergent themes, which had the greatest impact on our subsequent survey. These were women's exposure to and perceived believability of messages, their perception of risk associated with drinking, and the barriers to cutting down on alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Questions added to our survey instrument because of these findings included whether women think that some alcohol beverages are safer to drink than others; how they value cutting back alcohol use; their views on the irreversibility of fetal alcohol syndrome; and what pressures they feel from peers and family to drink during pregnancy. Given the small sample size associated with focus groups, these results cannot be generalized to larger populations however, these women's words revealed important underlying issues and barriers that should be considered in studying and intervening with larger representative samples.

T1  - Measuring the facial phenotype of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure: Correlations with brain dysfunction
A1  - Astley S.J.
A1  - Clarren S.K.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - The purpose of this report is to demonstrate how to measure the magnitude of expression of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) facial phenotype using the new 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and the previously developed D-score and to demonstrate how these two measures of the FAS facial phenotype correlate with brain function and structure; correlations that fail to be identified by the older gestalt method of facial measurement. The D-score and the facial component of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code quantitatively measure the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype using three facial features (palpebral fissure length, philtrum smoothness, and upper lip thinness). These facial measurement systems were developed by the Washington State FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN) of clinics and are used to screen and diagnose the facial component of FAS for all patients evaluated in the network of clinics (1500 to date). The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code is a comprehensive diagnostic system developed by the FAS DPN in 1997 to diagnose the full spectrum of outcomes among patients with prenatal alcohol exposure. The four digits reflect the magnitude of expression of the four key diagnostic features of FAS in the following order: (1) growth deficiency; (2) the FAS facial phenotype; (3) brain dysfunction; (4) gestational alcohol exposure. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code was developed to overcome the subjective, highly variable gestalt method of diagnosis that has been used as the standard to date, worldwide. Prior to the development of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the first 445 patients evaluated in the FAS DPN were diagnosed using the gestalt method. For research purposes, their gestalt diagnoses were transformed into 4-Digit Diagnostic Codes, presenting a unique opportunity to directly compare the two diagnostic methods. When the facial phenotype was measured using the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code or D-score, the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype was significantly correlated with structural, neurologic, and functional measures of brain damage, and the phenotype of those receiving a 4-Digit Diagnosis of FAS showed little variability. When the gestalt method of diagnosis was used, the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype did not correlate with structural, neurologic and functional measures of brain damage, and the facial phenotype of those receiving a gestalt diagnosis of FAS was highly variable. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and D-score thus provide more precise and accurate measures of the FAS facial phenotype and reveal important correlations with brain structure and function, suggesting that intermediate expressions of the FAS facial phenotype may serve as important risk factors for brain damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Our previous studies revealed abnormalities on structural MRI (sMRI) in small groups of children exposed to alcohol prenatally. Microcephaly, disproportionately reduced basal ganglia volume, and abnormalities of the cerebellar vermis and corpus callosum were demonstrated. The present study used sMRI to examine in detail the regional pattern of brain hypoplasia resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol using a higher resolution imaging protocol and larger sample sizes than reported previously. Fourteen participants (mean 11.4 years; eight females, six males) with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 12 participants (mean 14.8 years; four females, eight males) with prenatal exposure to alcohol (PEA) but without the facial features of FAS were compared to a group of 41 control participants (mean 12.8 years, 20 females, 21 males). Findings of significant microcephaly and disproportionately reduced basal ganglia volumes in the FAS group were confirmed. Novel findings were that in FAS participants, white matter volumes were more affected than gray matter volumes in the cerebrum, and parietal lobes were more affected than temporal and occipital lobes. Among subcortical structures, in contrast to the disproportionate effects on caudate nucleus, the hippocampus was relatively preserved in FAS participants. Differences between the PEA group and controls were generally non-significant; however, among a few of the structures most affected in FAS participants, there was some evidence for volume reduction in PEA participants as well, specifically in basal ganglia and the parietal lobe. There were no group differences in cerebral volume asymmetries. Severe prenatal alcohol exposure appears to produce a specific pattern of brain hypoplasia.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Women who abuse alcohol during pregnancy may deliver offspring who could be diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or a less severe deficit involving cognitive and behavioral disorders. The severity of the deficits may involve the interaction of several known risk factors, such as alcohol consumption pattern or duration, the timing of alcohol consumption relative to critical windows of vulnerability, or the inherent differential vulnerability among the various brain regions to alcohol-induced brain injury. In this study, we explore the vulnerability of the different brain regions by making cell counts from multiple brain regions. Specifically, we used stereological cell-counting techniques to estimate the total cell numbers in the cerebellum (Purkinje and granule cells), olfactory bulb (mitral and granule cells), hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 cells), and dentate gyrus (granule cells). Groups of timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of five treatments: alcohol by intragastric intubation (2.25, 4.5, or 6.5 g/kg/day), nutritional control [pairfed and intubated=Pairfed) and intubated], and normal control (Chow). Treatments began on embryonic day 1 (E1) and continued through E20. On E33 (usually postnatal day 10), all offspring were perfused intracardially with saline followed by fixatives. Representative forebrains, cerebella, and olfactory bulb from each group were processed for cell counting. The optical dissector was used to obtain cell densities, while Cavalieri's principle was used to calculate the reference volume. The product of density and volume gave unbiased estimates of the total neuronal number within each brain region. Overall peak BACs (regardless of sampling day) for the three alcohol groups averaged 136, 290, and 422 mg/dl for the 2.25-, 4.5-, and 6.5-g/kg groups, respectively. The total number of cerebellar Purkinje cells was reduced in the 6.5-g/kg group relative to controls, while the total number of olfactory bulb mitral cells and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells from all alcohol-treated groups was not different from controls. Total numbers of granule neurons were reduced in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb of offspring exposed to 4.5 or 6.5 g/kg/day, but granule cell numbers in the dentate gyrus were not affected by the prenatal alcohol treatment. Taken together with previous findings, these data demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure results in regional vulnerability of various brain structures and underscores the variability of deleterious effects of alcohol on brain development.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Alcohol abuse by pregnant women can result in fetal alcohol effects (FAE) and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Both ethanol itself and its main metabolite, acetaldehyde (Ach), are able to produce specific FAS-related malformations. In previous in vitro studies, we documented that 10-day-old rat embryos exposed to Ach show a characteristic embryonic Ach syndrome, histologically characterized by marked cellular death. As both necrosis and pathological apoptosis are teratological mechanisms, the aim of this work was to evaluate if cellular death, observed in Ach-exposed embryos, can be related to necrotic or apoptotic events. Ten-day-old rat embryos were cultured in the presence of Ach 30-60 mug/ml and stained with the vital dye acridine orange to visualize apoptotic areas. After fixation, the TUNEL [3' terminal deoxynucleotide tranferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling] method was used to histologically identify apoptosis. Both acridine orange and TUNEL staining showed signs of physiological apoptosis in controls and abnormal apoptotic regions in Ach-exposed embryos. Our results show a clear correlation between malformed organs and apoptotic embryonic districts, suggesting the role of apoptosis in Ach-induced abnormalities. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Affective prosody is a nonlinguistic aspect of language that conveys emotion and attitude during discourse. It is a dominant function of the right hemisphere. Because skills associated with the right hemisphere have been found to be impaired in alcoholics, this study explored the possibility that affective prosodic functioning may be sensitive to the effects of alcohol due to heavy persistent drinking or prenatal exposure. Methods: Subjects were aged 25 to 58 years. Twenty-nine men and three women who met DSM-IV criteria for an alcohol use disorder with a median of 39 days of sobriety, 11 men with a probable history of fetal alcohol exposure (FAexp), and 41 age-matched control subjects of both sexes were tested by using the Aprosodia Battery. This instrument assesses affective prosodic comprehension (APC) across a range of verbal articulatory demands. Results: The alcoholic group scored 2 SD below the control mean, and the FAexp group scored -5 SD regardless of whether they had ever been diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Despite their poor performance on APC, alcoholic and FAexp groups performed similarly to the control group on vocabulary, abstract reasoning, and an index of cognitive impairment that used the Shipley Institute of Living Scale. Multiple regression analyses that used nine alcohol use variables to model APC resulted in four significant contributors to the effect. These regressors were related to early exposure to ethanol and chronicity of alcohol abuse. Conclusions: Alcoholics and FAexp subjects were significantly less accurate at APC compared with controls. These alcohol-exposed subjects appear to be deficient in the ability to understand emotional valence in the speech of others, which results in errors of judgment that may impair social interactions.

N2  - Incomplete neural tube fusion (iNTF), induced by alcohol, in midline floor and roof plates was found in our recent study. In this study, serotonin (5-HT) neurons, known to be born entirely in the midline raphe at brainstem, were examined during their development with fetal alcohol exposure. Weight-matched C57BL mice pregnant dams were divided into three groups on E8: one received ethanol via a chocolate Sustacal liquid diet providing 20% ethanol-derived calories as the sole source of nutrients (ALC); the second received an isocaloric Sustacal liquid diet and was pair-fed to individual dams in the ethanol-fed group (PF); the third was fed ad lib rat chow (Chow). Fetal brains were obtained on E15 and were processed for immunostaining of 5-HT and its trophic factor, S100beta. The ascending 5-HT neurons, in normal development, appear bilaterally near midline on E12, and by E15, as seen in chow and PF groups, migrate from the midline germinal zone laterally and dorsally to their final position with rich fibers. In contrast, in the E15 ALC group, many 5-HT-im neurons were found remaining in the midline germinal region or had migrated, but with under-differentiated, sparse fibers. There were 20-30% fewer 5-HT-im neurons in ALC as compared to PF and Chow. In addition, the number of S100beta cells was less in ALC as compared with PF and Chow groups. No difference was found between PF and Chow in number of 5-HT-im or S100beta-im cells. The 5-HT neurons found compromised in migration and differentiation may, in part, stem from failure of access to floor plate or midline tissue induction and the insufficient support by S100beta. As 5-HT neurons have been implicated for signaling brain maturation, fewer 5-HT neurons may have lasting effects on the development of brain or, if persistent in the adult, profoundly affect adult brain function. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

T1  - Identifying maternal self-reported alcohol use associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: The incidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) has been estimated at 1 to 3 per 1000 live births. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) (which include FAS) are estimated to occur in about 1 in 100 births. Cessation of drinking during pregnancy can improve the outcome even if the unborn child is already affected. For individuals born with FASD, an early diagnosis appears to be a protective factor against secondary disabilities. A quick screening tool to identify newborn children at risk has been elusive. Methods: A simple descriptive presentation is offered that shows where 36 individuals with FASD were found from among the many patterns and amounts of prenatal alcohol use that were reported by a sample of 1439 pregnant women whose offspring were later examined within the first 7 years of life. Results: Individuals with FASD (i.e., those with FAS, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder) were found within two aggregates of alcohol scores that together recommend a set of three to four alcohol questions. Within this derivation sample, one scoring of the questions yields almost 78% sensitivity and 97% specificity for FASD. Another scoring of the same instrument yields 100% sensitivity with 90% specificity. Conclusions: These new data may facilitate early identification of offspring who may be most in need of early intervention, namely those born with FASD.

N2  - Background: Epilepsy is a prominent sign of neurologic dysfunction in some children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, it is unknown whether the epileptic disorders in these children are directly due to the neuroteratogenic effects of alcohol or to some other factor accompanying maternal alcoholism. The hippocampus is vulnerable to alcohol-induced pathologic changes, and dysfunction of the hippocampus often manifests as epilepsy. We examined the effect of alcohol exposure during development on the seizure threshold and examined the relationship between alteration of seizure threshold and alcohol-induced neuronal loss from the hippocampus. Methods: Rat pups received 0.85, 2.5, or 3.75 g/kg of alcohol via intragastric intubation daily over postnatal days (PD) 4-9. An intubated control and a suckle control group were also included. To assess the effect of a single day of alcohol exposure, an additional group received 3.75 g/kg of alcohol on PD 4 alone. Behavioral seizure thresholds were determined by intravenous infusion of the proconvulsant, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), on PD 31 or on PD 90. In addition, electrographic seizure thresholds were determined by recording extracellular field potentials from the dentate gyrus. The number of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, CA3 pyramidal cells, and granule cells of the dentate gyrus were determined by stereology. Results: Daily exposure to alcohol resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the seizure threshold and in the selective loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. Reduction in the seizure threshold was significantly correlated with loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. Recordings of extracellular field potentials confirmed the alcohol-induced reduction in seizure threshold, demonstrated that PTZ-induced seizures involve hippocampal-parahippocampal circuitry, and provided evidence that the hippocampal formation is the generator of the PTZ-induced seizures in alcohol-exposed animals. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that exposure of the developing brain to alcohol can permanently reduce the threshold for both behavioral and electrographic seizures and can selectively kill hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Both the pathologic findings and the physiologic recordings support the concept that the reduced seizure threshold in alcohol-exposed animals is due to hippocampal pathology.

N2  - Background: Understanding the basis for ethanol's teratogenic effects may inform the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome. Here we investigate how genetic background and susceptibility to ethanol-induced neural crest apoptosis contribute to the distinctive craniofacial phenotype observed after prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Nine different chick strains were exposed to ethanol at gastrulation. The sensitivity of these embryos to ethanol-induced neural crest apoptosis was reported elsewhere (Debelak and Smith, 2000). Here, these embryos were permitted to develop until embryonic day 10, when facial morphogenesis was largely complete, and cephalometric measurements were made on cleared skulls. Shifts in facial growth were correlated against the severity of ethanol-induced apoptosis in facial precursors. Results: The facial shape produced by ethanol exposure was a function of the embryos' genetic strain. Three general responses were observed: apparent midfacial flattening (Babcock B300 x Hampshire Red, ISA-Babcock, HyLine W98, and HyLine W36 strains), overall facial expansion (Spafas and Babcock B300 strains), or overall facial hypoplasia (DeKalb strains). When dose and timing of exposure were held constant, the embryo's genetic background predicted the facial outcome. For ethanol-sensitive strains, apoptosis of facial precursor populations was required to produce the facial defects. That some strains had essentially normal faces despite extensive cell death indicated a capacity to recover from the earlier neural crest losses. Conclusions: We propose that ethanol's effects on craniofacial development are multifactoral, and these influences may include susceptibility to apoptosis, regenerative capacity, and compensatory outgrowth of the facial primordia. The embryo's genetic background may modulate these events. The high and low responder chick strains are useful tools to dissect these contributions.

T1  - Effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on midsagittal commissure size in rats
A1  - Bower C.
A1  - Ryan A.
A1  - Rudy E.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol exposure in humans can cause a variety of brain and behavioral abnormalities. The brain abnormalities include defects in the corpus callosum that range from total absence (agenesis) to reduction in size or thickness. Determination of the critical alcohol level or time period of exposure to produce these effects is difficult because of the lack of control of possible mitigating factors. Methods: The present study was undertaken to examine possible relationships between midsagittal corpus callosum dimensions and prenatal alcohol level as measured by blood alcohol concentration, as well as prenatal period of exposure as measured by first- or second- or first- plus second-trimester equivalents in a rat model. In addition to the corpus callosum, the hippocampal and anterior commissures were also examined. Pregnant mothers were given a single daily dose of alcohol by intragastric gavage; four different doses were tested in different mothers. Peak blood alcohol concentration was determined at one of four hourly intervals thereafter. Control pregnant mothers were pairfed to individual alcohol treated mothers and handled accordingly, but no alcohol was given. Other controls consisted of normal, untreated pregnant mothers. Results: The results show all measures of corpus callosum and anterior commissure were not affected by any dose of alcohol during any time period. However, higher BAC levels during prolonged periods of alcohol exposure were associated with reduced size of the hippocampal commissure. Conclusions: The results suggest that additional experimental factors not included in the present study are responsible for the effects observed in humans. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a whole spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) sequelae that persist throughout the life span and manifest in a spectrum of effects from clinically indistinguishable to severely impairing. The greatest impact of alcohol as a teratogen is to the brain-the greatest need is for holistic treatment and management of the associated mental disorders. The interaction of this subtle brain damage with the complex psychosocial circumstances surrounding the birth of a child to a mother with alcohol problems can further compound development and result in costly and devastating social consequences. Research is urgently needed on the chronic neuropsychiatric sequelae of these subtle birth defects of the brain. Identification of these fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in the psychiatric nomenclature is a necessary step to focus the attention and resources of the mental health field on this personally and socially significant problem.

T1  - An alternative to standard drinks as a measure of alcohol consumption
A1  - Kaskutas L.A.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Despite the field's longstanding concern with underreporting of alcohol consumption, traditional survey questions encourage error because respondents often must calculate their number of drinks based on standard drink sizes that often do not match their own drinking style. This study considered how often respondents' self-defined drink sizes matched a 'standard' drink size based on approximately 12 g of ethanol for six different beverages. We also studied whether respondents could accurately judge the size of their drinks. Subjects were recruited and interviewed at urban prenatal clinics, health clinics, and via snowball referrals and community outreach in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Because of the urgency of accurate measurement of consumption during pregnancy, urban pregnant women from the groups most at risk for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Native Americans (n = 102) and African Americans (185), were targeted. A small comparison group of urban pregnant white women (n = 34) was included. One-hour in-person interviews were conducted. Self-defined drink sizes were determined for each beverage consumed, using models and photographs of vessels. Frequent drinkers and the majority of women who reported drinking higher alcohol content beverages reported drinking larger-than-standard drink sizes. The median size of a malt liquor drink among the daily drinkers was almost three times as large as the standard, their fortified wine drinks were four times the standard, and their spirits drinks were six times the standard size. The majority of drinkers of each beverage were unable to accurately judge the size of their drinks, underestimating the number of fluid ounces by about 30%. Although the vessels methodology used here must be refined and tested further on other populations (e.g., men, nonpregnant women, and all ethnic groups), results suggest that determination of risk levels should be based on survey data that takes into consideration the beverage mix and the actual size of respondents' alcohol drinks.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most devastating. Recognizable by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities and growth deficiency, this condition includes severe alcohol-induced damage to the developing brain. FAS children experience deficits in intellectual functioning; difficulties in learning, memory, problem-solving, and attention; and difficulties with mental health and social interactions. An FAS diagnosis, however, fails to identify prenatal-alcohol-exposed children who lack the characteristic facial defects and growth deficiency of FAS. Nonetheless, these often undiagnosed children may still experience serious fetal alcohol effects (FAE), including alcohol-induced mental impairments (i.e., alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorder) or alcohol-related abnormalities of the skeleton and certain organ systems (i.e., alcohol-related birth defects). Neuroimaging techniques can assist researchers in identifying FAE through precise pictures of brain abnormalities in persons prenatally exposed to alcohol. By understanding the mechanisms underlying FAE and the behavioral manifestations of the resulting structural brain damage, researchers can ultimately develop effective FAS prevention strategies that identify and assist high-risk women at varying levels of pregnancy.

T1  - Reducing complications from alcohol use during pregnancy through screening
A1  - Morse B.A.
A1  - Hutchins E.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal providers are reluctant to discuss alcohol use in the clinical setting, even though heavy alcohol use is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), sometimes known as alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. Fourteen percent to 20% of pregnant women report drinking some alcohol during pregnancy. Approximately 0.2% to 1% meet the criteria for heavy drinking. Reducing drinking during pregnancy has the potential to reduce the risk for FAS and FAE. Routine screening for alcohol use during pregnancy followed by referrals for those considered to be at risk is recommended. Women are often more receptive to intervention during pregnancy, as they focus on positive health behaviors. A number of brief screening tools designed for use on a routine basis are reviewed. Physicians who learn to comfortably discuss alcohol use during pregnancy can help substantially reduce the impact of these disorders.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, mental retardation, and neurodevelopmental disorders. In 1973, a cluster of birth defects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure was recognized as a clinical entity called fetal alcohol syndrome. More recently, alcohol exposure in utero has been linked to a variety of other neurodevelopmental problems, and the terms alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects have been proposed to identify infants so affected. This statement is an update of a previous statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics and reflects the current thinking about alcohol exposure in utero and the revised nosology.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - PURPOSE: Fetal exposure to alcohol is a serious public health problem and is associated with anomalies of the eye ground, as well as neurodevelopmental delay, growth delay, and characteristic facial features. Our purpose is to report the incidence of abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) results in children with fetal alcohol syndrome and raise awareness of the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome in ophthalmology. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on the records of 11 children with the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. The results of the ophthalmologic examination, magnetic resonance imaging, visual acuity test, and ERG are reported. RESULTS: The magnetic resonance imaging results were abnormal in all subjects tested. The ophthalmology examination showed optic nerve hypoplasia in 91% of the subjects. Visual acuity was reduced in all but one subject. The ERG results were abnormal, showing reduced b-wave amplitude, increased a- and b-wave implicit time, reduced Rmax, and increased log (k). The scotopic ERG was more severely affected than the photopic ERG. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to changes in retinal function as evidenced by an abnormal ERG response. The ERG can therefore be a tool with which to identify suspected alcohol embryopathy.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a specific polydystrophic pattern of malformations with the following diagnostic criteria: 1. Maternal alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse during pregnancy. 2. Pre- and postnatal deficiency of growth in weight, height and head circumference. 3. Multiple minor and major anomalies recognizable mainly at a typical face. 4. Structural injuries and changes at the central nervous system with complex brain dysfunction combining elements of cognitive impairments, behavioral disturbance and neurological damage. Fetal alcohol effects (FAE) or so-called "alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders" (ARND) with predominant neurotoxic effects and a large spectrum of cerebral dysfunctions are manifold more frequent than the full-blown FAS. These remain mostly unrecognized, overlooked and they are difficult to be diagnosed, the symptoms being unspecific. Alcohol in pregnancy is nowadays the most important and the most frequent toxic substance for the embryo and the fetus and one of the most frequent causes of mental retardation. The longlasting and irreversible consequences refer to school development, social maturation, social behaviour and later life-style. The diagnosis is based on the careful maternal history and on the clinical findings; there are no biochemical parameters of assessment. The risk of addiction development in these children is assumed to be more than 20 percent.

T1  - An alternative to standard drinks as a measure of alcohol consumption

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Despite the field's longstanding concern with underreporting of alcohol consumption, traditional survey questions encourage error because respondents often must calculate their number of drinks based on standard drink sizes that often do not match their own drinking style. This study considered how often respondents' self-defined drink sizes matched a 'standard' drink size based on approximately 12 g of ethanol for six different beverages. We also studied whether respondents could accurately judge the size of their drinks. Subjects were recruited and interviewed at urban prenatal clinics, health clinics, and via snowball referrals and community outreach in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Because of the urgency of accurate measurement of consumption during pregnancy, urban pregnant women from the groups most at risk for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Native Americans (n=102) and African Americans (185), were targeted. A small comparison group of urban pregnant white women (n=34) was included. One-hour in-person interviews were conducted. Self-defined drink sizes were determined for each beverage consumed, using models and photographs of vessels. Frequent drinkers and the majority of women who reported drinking higher alcohol content beverages reported drinking larger-than-standard drink sizes. The median size of a malt liquor drink among the daily drinkers was almost three times as large as the standard, their fortified wine drinks were four times the standard, and their spirits drinks were six times the standard size. The majority of drinkers of each beverage were unable to accurately judge the size of their drinks, underestimating the number of fluid ounces by about 30%. Although the vessels methodology used here must be refined and tested further on other populations (e.g., men, nonpregnant women, and all ethnic groups), results suggest that determination of risk levels should be based on survey data that takes into consideration the beverage mix and the actual size of respondents' alcohol drinks. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Patients with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) often have difficulty functioning appropriately in everyday life and seem to employ poor problem-solving strategies. Tests of executive function are relevant for quantifying the functional deficits and underlying real-life problems associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This study considers two pathways for the effects of prenatal alcohol on executive function: a direct effect and an indirect effect through prenatal alcohol's effect on IQ. We compared 30 men who had been diagnosed with FAS or FAE with young adults participating in a longitudinal prospective study (n = 419) and 15 control participants that comprised a comparison group. This study is unique in its analysis of the same battery of assessments of executive function in both a large low dose longitudinal study sample and a clinically diagnosed group. Participants were evaluated on 9 tests (including 58 scores) of executive function. For some but not all of the tests in this executive function battery, the decrement in the alcohol exposure group is greater than would be predicted from their IQ scores. We found that 3 of 6 Stroop scores, 2 of 4 Trails scores, 9 of 16 Wisconsin Card Sorting scores, 1 of 2 Ruff's Figural Fluency scores, and 2 of 4 Consonant Trigrams scores appear to be particularly sensitive to the direct effects of prenatal alcohol damage for patients with FAS and FAE. The findings suggest that these executive function tests would be particularly useful in clinical evaluations of persons suspected of fetal alcohol damage because they would not simply reflect deficits in IQ or facial stigmata.

N2  - The association between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and an increased incidence of teratogenic effects has been well established. The most severe manifestation of this effect is the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by craniofacial malformation, grown retardation and developmental disability in affected children. Estimates of prevalence at birth of FAS range from 0,4 to 3,1 per 1000 births, depending on population, race, socioeconomic status, etc. Incidence is considerably higher among alcoholic women: approximately 30-40% in infants of alcoholic mothers. The minimum daily alcohol intake that affects the fetus and the mechanism of alcohol's toxic effect on the fetus are not well understood, but many studies have contributed to the understanding of these important questions. The following review focuses on major recent findings in this field.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, mental retardation, and neurodevelopmental disorders. In 1973, a cluster of birth defects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure was recognized as a clinical entity called fetal alcohol syndrome. More recently, alcohol exposure in utero has been linked to a variety of other neurodevelopmental problems, and the terms alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects have been proposed to identify infants so affected. This statement is an update of a previous statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics and reflects the current thinking about alcohol exposure in utero and the revised nosology.

N2  - Objective: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and less severe outcomes are typically diagnosed later in childhood, although earlier diagnosis of the effects of exposure would allow intervention in infancy and prevention of associated secondary disabilities. Identification is particularly difficult in such high-risk groups as low-birthweight infants. The goal of this study was to develop methods for early identification of at-risk infants. Method: Three methods (microcephaly, heavy episodic drinking [>5 drinks/occasion] in pregnancy and a cumulative risk index) identified neonates at risk for those developmental consequences of prenatal exposure that can be measured at 6 and 12 months (i.e., standard scores on Bayley Scales of Infant Development and growth measures). The usefulness of these methods was assessed by comparing those infants selected to an unexposed contrast group, while controlling for potentially confounding factors (e.g., race, socioeconomic status and birthweight). Results: At 6 months, when 70 infants were tested, trends were found for lower language facet scores and lower scores on the Behavioral Regulation Scale; at 12 months, when 134 were tested, alcohol-exposed infants had significantly lower cognitive facet scores (p < .02) and were more likely to be classified as either mildly or significantly developmentally delayed (p < .02). Conclusions: It is possible to identify infants at risk for alcohol- related developmental delays using information available in the neonatal period, although it is not usually done. Of the three methods tested, a cumulative risk index based on maternal characteristics was found to be most predictive.

T1  - Twelve-year follow-up of children exposed to alcohol in utero
A1  - Autti-Ramo I.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Eighty-two women who were consuming alcohol while pregnant attended a special clinic at the University Central Hospital, Helsinki with the aim of reducing heavy drinking during pregnancy. The children born to these women were followed up regularly. During their preschool years the children were assessed to have fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, pre- and/or postnatal growth retardation, or they were assessed to have normal cognitive and somatic growth. Of the original children, 70 of 82 could be traced st the age of la years. Through semistructured interview and contact with the health and social care authorities, information was gathered about schooling, family structure, whether help had been sought for behavioural difficulties and major adverse events in the family. The longer the intrauterine alcohol exposure and the more severe the diagnosis related to prenatal alcohol exposure, the more often the children required special education, were temporarily or permanently taken into care, and had behavioural problems. There is a considerable need for prolonged multidisciplinary follow-up and support of all children whose mothers have not been able to reduce drinking in early pregnancy, whether or not cognitive disturbances are evident in early childhood.

N2  - About 20% of pregnant women will drink alcohol, even though no universally safe level of prenatal alcohol consumption has been established. This study of 123 alcohol screen-positive pregnant women receiving a brief intervention in the 16th week of gestation examines the relationship of drinking goals, reasons for the goals, recognition of situations increasing risk of drinking, and subsequent antepartum consumption. While women who named abstinence as their antepartum drinking goal were more likely not to be consuming alcohol at the time of study enrollment (chi2 = 16.80, df = 1, p = .001), current drinkers who named abstinence as their goal did reduce subsequent prenatal alcohol use (chi2 = 10.04, df = 1, p = .002). All current drinkers who indicated fetal alcohol syndrome as a reason not to drink reduced their subsequent alcohol consumption (chi2 = 11.04, df = 1, p = .001). Future efforts may include the partners and support systems of pregnant women in education or intervention programs to reduce prenatal alcohol consumption to enhance their effectiveness.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To established the prevalence of fetal alcohol exposures; to compare physical, behavioural and learning patterns of children with significant alcohol exposure in utero with those of a group of children exposed to minimal alcohol; to assess the usefulness of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/fetal alcohol effect (FAE) score; and to provide feedback to parents, schools and communities. DESIGN: Parent questionnaire, complete physical examinations of children, psychometric tests of the children using elements of the Pediatric Early Elementary Examination (PEEX) and the Pediatric Examination of Educational Readiness (PEER), ADD-H comprehensive teachers rating scale (ACTeRS) score, the newly developed FAS/FAE Score, and the Brigance Comprehensive Inventory of Basic Skills to assess language and mathematical achievement. Testers were blinded to the results of the assessments and questionnaires. SETTING: Grades 1 to 3 at Sir Alexander MacKenzie School in Inuvik, Northwest Territories. RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of mothers reported frequent or binge drinking and 76% of mothers reported abstinence or moderate alcohol intake. There were significant ethnic differences; none of the Caucasian mothers reported frequently or binge drinking during pregnancy compared with 40% of Inuvialuit and 33% of Indian mothers. Children with exposure to frequent or binge drinking in utero had smaller palpebral fissures (2.3+/-0.1 cm versus 2.5+/-0.3 cm, P<0.01), smaller palpebral fissure to intercanthal distance ratio (0.77+/-0.05 versus 0.86+/-0.10, P<0.01) and smaller head circumferences (52.1+/-1.6 cm versus 53.62=1.6 cm, P<0.01) than those exposed to moderate drinking or abstinence. Children exposed to frequent or binge drinking in utero also demonstrated poorer coordination (P<0.005) and cortical function (P<0.01), attention problems, hyperactivity (ACTeRS), and poorer scholastic achievement in language (P<0.001) and mathematics (P<0.01) than their minimally exposed counterparts. In children in grades 2 and 3, a significant negative correlation was found between FAS/FAE scores and language (r=-0.55, P<0.001) and mathematical achievement (r=-0.28, P=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of drinking during pregnancy in the northern population studied was high, and exposure in utero was associated with physical abnormalities, difficulties with coordination and cortical function, and significant delays in language and mathematical achievement. The FAS/FAE score may be useful in predicting success or failure in language development.

Responses were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Results: Of the 60% of the obstetrician-gynecologists who responded to the survey, 97% reported asking their pregnant patients about alcohol use. When a patient reports alcohol use, most respondents reported that they always discuss adverse effects and always advise abstinence. One fifth of the respondents (20%) reported abstinence to be the safest way to avoid all four of the adverse pregnancy outcomes cited (ie, spontaneous abortion, central nervous system impairment, birth defects, and fetal alcohol syndrome); 13% were unsure about levels associated with all of the adverse outcomes; and 4% reported that consumption of eight or more drinks per week did not pose a risk for any of the four adverse outcomes. The two resources that respondents said they needed most to improve alcohol-use assessment were information on thresholds for adverse reproductive outcomes (83%) and referral resources for patients with alcohol problems (63%). Conclusion: Efforts should be made to provide practicing obstetrician-gynecologists with updates on the adverse effects of alcohol use by pregnant women and with effective methods for screening and counseling women who report alcohol use during pregnancy.

T1  - Parent ratings of behavior in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and IQ-matched controls
A1  - Mattson S.N.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Background: Behavioral disturbances are well documented in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. However, the degree to which these disturbances are related to factors other than alcohol, such as general intellectual functioning or socioeconomic status, is not known. Methods: Using the Child Behavior Checklist, parent-rated behaviors of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were compared with those of a control group matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and verbal IQ score. Using this same questionnaire, children with fetal alcohol syndrome were compared with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure that did not meet the criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome classification. Results: Data were analyzed by multivariate analyses of covariance. In the comparison of children with and without a history of prenatal alcohol exposure, significant differences were found on the competence, problem, and summary scales (all p < 0.05). For the secondary comparison between the fetal alcohol syndrome and the heavy prenatal alcohol exposure groups, there were no significant differences on any of the scales (all p > 0.10). Conclusions: These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure results in the significant and profound impairment of parent-rated behaviors and that these deficits are not explained entirely by the presence or absence of facial dysmorphology, general intellectual functioning, or demographic factors.

T1  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the hippocampus: Spatial behavior, electrophysiology, and neuroanatomy
A1  - Berman R.F.
A1  - Hannigan J.H.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), characterized by growth retardation, facial dysmorphologies, and a host of neurobehavioral impairments. Neurobehavioral effects in FAS, and in alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, include poor learning and memory, attentional deficits, and motor dysfunction. Many of these behavioral deficits can be modeled in rodents. This paper reviews the literature suggesting that many fetal alcohol effects result, at least in part, from teratogenic effects of alcohol on the hippocampus. Neurobehavioral studies show that animals exposed prenatally to alcohol are impaired in many of the same spatial learning and memory tasks sensitive to hippocampal damage, including T-mazes, the Morris water maze, and the radial arm maze. Direct evidence for hippocampal involvement is provided by neuroanatomical studies of the hippocampus documenting reduced numbers of neurons, lower dendritic spine density on pyramidal neurons, and decreased morphological plasticity after environmental enrichment in rats exposed prenatally to alcohol. Electrophysiological studies also demonstrate changes in synaptic activity in in vitro hippocampal brain slices isolated from prenatal alcohol-exposed animals. Considered together, these observations demonstrate that prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in abnormal hippocampal development and function. Such studies provide a better understanding of neurological deficits associated with FAS in humans, and may also contribute to the development of strategies to ameliorate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behavior.

N2  - This study examined the effects of maternal periconceptional alcohol intake on polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations in human neonates. The area percentage of each fatty acid in cord blood serum from 12 infants born to control women (who consumed <2 mL absolute ethanol/d) was compared with that of 9 infants born to women whose periconceptional alcohol intake averaged >30 mL absolute ethanol/d. Periconceptional alcohol use was associated with a 30% increase in the proportion of docosahexaenoic acid (22.6n-3) in cord blood (3.0% of total lipid in control infants compared with 3.9% in alcohol-exposed infants; P < 0.01). The rise in the proportion of 22:6n-3 was responsible for increases in the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids and the ratio of long-chain n-3 to n-6 fatty acids (P < 0.055). Examination of the lipid-class fatty acid profile indicated that serum lipid alterations were localized to the cholesterol esters; 22:6n-3 in the cholesterol esters of alcohol-exposed infants increased 54% (P < 0.011) and arachidonic acid increased 55% (p < 0.005). The relative fatty acyl composition of maternal serum showed a significant increase in 18:0 fatty acids in the alcohol- exposed group (25%, P < 0.005) but there were no changes in the other fatty acids. The increase in the proportion of 22:6n-3 was unexpected but is consistent with the hypothesis that this essential lipid may be conserved selectively. These results imply that the lifelong neurobehavioral and sensory dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders may be due in part to PUFA dysregulation.

A1  - Loser H.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - All programs in prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) have been without success until now. Since the first descriptions of FAS in the early seventies the question arose, how the drinking pattern of pregnant women have changed and which maternal conflicts mainly inhibited prevention. Between 1973 and 1999 312 children with fullblown FAS and 119 with fetal alcohol effects were diagnosed, and their alcohol related historical data were assessed at the University Childrens Hospital in Munster. Only 93 mothers, all being alcohol dependent or abuser, could be asked postnatally in a trustful, structured interview as to their alcohol conflicts in pregnancy. The feelings of guilt and scruple, and the consciousness of being indebted to the damaged child are predominent. Many women did not know the real embryotoxic risk when drinking thoughtlessly and negligently in the first weeks of pregnancy. The own physical well-being could not be considered as separated from that of the child, mainly with alcohol dependent women. Social compulsion, trouble in partnership and the risk to lose the right of care for the child are further problems. Alcohol in pregnancy remains a problem which privately and in public is pushed away, concealed and displaced as harmless. Most of the preventive efforts in public failed to find an approach to alcohol drinking women and mainly to dependent drinker. Since alcohol is the most important damaging substance for the fetus with longlasting consequences, maternal conflicts and unchanged social attitude have to be considered as an essential cause of failed prevention.

T1  - Was the fetal alcohol syndrome recognized by the Greeks and Romans?
A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers/scientists are frequently quoted as expressing an awareness of potential harm associated with drinking during pregnancy. However, the statements attributed to these authors were not made by them. Instead, they are interpretations, presented in the form of verbatim statements, of their views relating to procreation. Although they did have something to say about the role of alcohol in procreation, it was the effects of drinking on the male body at the time of conception, and especially alcohol's effects on male body temperature, that concerned them. A cold body at the time of conception was believed to enhance the likelihood of conceiving a female, which to the Greeks and Romans was a 'deformity'.

T1  - Optic nerve morphology may reveal adverse events during prenatal and perinatal life-digital image analysis
A1  - Hellstrom A.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Objective: To evaluate optic nerve morphology in children with various conditions caused by adverse events during prenatal and/or perinatal life and to investigate whether optic nerve morphology can reveal brain lesions associated with these conditions, as well as provide insight into the etiology and timing of the prenatal and perinatal damage. Methods and patients: A digital image analysis technique was used to analyze fundus photographs. One hundred healthy Swedish individuals of various ages from childhood to adolescence constituted a reference group. The following patient groups were chosen to represent various clinical conditions affecting the newborn or fetus at different stages of development: children born preterm (N = 39), children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS [N = 16]), children with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL [N = 17]), and children with septo-optic dysplasia (SOD [N = 6]). Results: Preterm children without known brain lesions demonstrated normal optic disk morphology but abnormal retinal vascular pattern; children born preterm with an acquired brain lesion late in gestation (PVL) demonstrated normal disk size with enlarged cups in addition to the abnormal vascular pattern. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (FAS) had a subnormal optic disk area with increased tortuosity of both arteries and veins, whereas children born at term with an early acquired brain lesion (SOD) had a markedly reduced optic disk area with isolated tortuosity of the retinal veins. Conclusions: Evaluation of optic nerve morphology, by digital image analysis, demonstrated that differences in ocular fundus morphology were correlated with differences in etiology and timing of the adverse event occurring in prenatal and perinatal life. In addition, digital image analysis may be a helpful tool for understanding variations in optic nerve and retinal vessel morphology and their relationship with central nervous pathology.

N2  - Background: Children with heavy, prenatal alcohol exposure have well documented deficits in overall cognitive ability. Recently, attention has turned to the executive function (EF) domain in this population. Until recently, comprehensive measures of EF have not been available within one test battery. This study used a battery of tests to assess four domains of EF in alcohol-exposed children. Methods: The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Scale was used to evaluate EF in 18 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with and without a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and 10 nonexposed controls. Children ranged in age from 8 to 15 years. Measures from four domains of executive functioning were analyzed: planning ability, cognitive flexibility, selective inhibition, and concept formation and reasoning. Tasks consisted of primary EF measures as well as measures of secondary component skills. Results: Alcohol-exposed children were deficient on EF measures compared with nonexposed controls. Furthermore, in most cases, children with and without the FAS diagnosis did not differ from one another. These deficits were not entirely explainable by concomitant deficits on component skills. Specific impairments were identified within the domains of planning and response inhibition, with additional deficits in abstract thinking and flexibility. Conclusions: Deficits in executive functioning were observed in alcohol-exposed children with or without the diagnosis of FAS and in the absence of mental retardation. Performance on these EF tasks provides insight into the cognitive processes driving overall performance and has implications for adaptive and daily functions. These results are consistent with anecdotal and empirical reports of deficits in behavioral control and with neuroanatomical evidence of volumetric reductions in structures within the frontal-subcortical system in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Chan D.Q.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) describes the systemic and ocular anomalies resulting from the teratogenic effect of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. It is a leading cause of preventable birth defects in the U.S. Case Reports: Two case reports illustrate the characteristic findings in FAS. These include growth retardation, cognitive impairment, and facial dysmorphism. Ocular signs are prevalent, including small palpebral fissure, microcornea, strabismus, myopia, astigmatism, and optic nerve hypoplasia. Discussion: Fetal alcohol exposure can lead to a wide spectrum of systemic defects and vision deficits. The increasing frequency of drinking among pregnant women in recent years should call more public attention to this detrimental yet preventable syndrome. Conclusion: The high frequency of ocular manifestations aids in making a diagnosis of FAS, which can be challenging. Eye-care professionals can play an important role in patient management and the educational process.

N2  - Background: Deficits in attention are commonly identified among patients who have been prenatally exposed to alcohol, and they often affect the ability of the patients to function appropriately in society. Methods: Eleven adult patients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) were compared with nine adult subjects with no history of prenatal alcohol exposure, using four tests of visually and auditorially mediated attention. Results: In relation to the comparison group, patients with FAS/FAE exhibited substantial deficits in both auditory and visual attention; the auditory deficits were greater. We observed two predominant patterns of deficits among patients with FAS/FAE, one involving both auditory and visual attention problems and the other involving less severe auditory problems and even fewer visual problems. Most subjects with FAS or FAE had some manifestations of attention problems in at least one of the tests of attention used in this study. We present a new graphical representation of individual auditory Continuous Performance Test data across a 6-min period, which, compared with conventional scores, more clearly reveals the markedly disrupted and variable attention patterns displayed by some individuals with FAS or FAE. Conclusions: These findings suggest that detailed analysis of the pattern of individual performance for each subject is an important aspect of Continuous Performance Test assessment. Our findings further suggest that intellectual performance (intelligence quotient score) alone is not sufficient to account for the patterns of disrupted attention for individuals with FAS/FAE. Assessment of individuals with FAS or FAE should include measurement of attentional functioning in both the visual and auditory modalities.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with widespread and devastating neurodevelopmental deficits. Numerous reports have suggested memory deficits in both humans and animals exposed prenatally to alcohol. However, the nature of these memory deficits remains to be characterized. Recently children with fetal alcohol syndrome were shown to have learning and memory deficits on a verbal learning and memory measure that involved free recall and recognition memory. The current study seeks to further characterize memory functioning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure by evaluating priming performance. The choice of task is also relevant given previous studies of memory performance in patient groups with and without involvement of the basal ganglia, a group of structures known to be affected in fetal alcohol syndrome. Three groups were evaluated for lexical priming, free recall, recognition memory, and verbal fluency: (1) children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure; (2) children with Down syndrome; and (3) nonexposed controls. The children with Down syndrome showed significantly less priming than alcohol-exposed children, who did not differ from controls. In addition, the alcohol-exposed children were impaired on the free recall task but not on the recognition memory task, whereas the children with Down syndrome performed significantly worse than the alcohol-exposed group on both tasks. Finally, on the verbal fluency task, children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were impaired on both category and letter fluency, but the degree of impairment was greater for letter fluency. These results further characterize the memory deficits in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure suggesting that in spite of learning and memory deficits, they are able to benefit from priming of verbal information.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Certain skin disorders are affected by alcohol abuse. Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy also gives rise to a typical malformation pattern in the child with a varying degree of severity (grade I-III). The diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is based on the detailed history of the maternal alcohol consumption in combination with the clinical, morphological, intellectual and psychosocial development of the child. The behavior of the child is also of diagnostic value. The grade of severity of the FAS can be determined during the first three years of life on the basis of a scoring system. In addition to medical care and surgical treatment of associated disorders, early support for the mental development of the child is of immense importance. Furthermore, the medical, social and psychological care of the mother must be considered. In the field of dermatology, knowledge about the pathomechanism of FAS is also important for its prevention in unborn children. Women of childbearing age presenting with dermatological signs of possible alcohol abuse, should alert the dermatologist to the possible risk to the child of FAS. Familiarity with FAS and the ability to recognise its clinical features are important for the adequate treatment and support of the affected child and for the mother suffering from alcohol disease, in cooperation with other treating doctors.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Background: Frequent alcohol use during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy can result in spontaneous abortion and dysmorphologic changes in the developing organ systems of the embryo, including the heart, kidneys, and brain. However, few population-based studies are available that describe the prevalence of frequent drinking (6 or more drinks per week) among women prior to and during early pregnancy (the periconceptional period), and the sociodemographic and behavioral factors that characterize these women. Such knowledge is fundamental to the design of targeted interventions for the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other prenatal alcohol-related disorders.Methods: This cross-sectional study used survey data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics as part of the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS). Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated using SUDAAN, and multivariate analyses were used to determine risk factors for frequent drinking.Results: Forty-five percent of all women surveyed reported consuming alcohol during the 3 months before finding out they were pregnant, and 5% reported consuming 6 or more drinks per week. Sixty percent of women who reported alcohol consumption also reported that they did not learn they were pregnant until after the fourth week of gestation. Risk factors for frequent drinking during the periconceptional period included 1 or more of the following: being unmarried, being a smoker, being white non-Hispanic, being 25 years of age or older, or being college educated.Conclusions: Half of all pregnant women in this study drank alcohol during the 3 months preceding pregnancy recognition , with 1 in 20 drinking at moderate to heavy levels. The majority did not know they were pregnant until after the fourth week of pregnancy, and many did not know until after the 6th week. Alcohol is a teratogen capable of producing a number of adverse reproductive and infant outcomes. Public health measures needed to reduce these potentially harmful exposures include alcohol assessment , education, and counseling for women of childbearing age, with referral sources for problem drinking, and family planning services for pregnancy postponement until problem drinking is resolved.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Children of women who abuse alcohol during pregnancy may be affected by varying degrees of neurological abnormality, even if they are not diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The extent of the behavioral deficits of the affected offspring may be a function of several factors, such as the differential vulnerability of the various regions of the brain-to-alcohol insult. In this study, groups of timed-pregnant rats were exposed to different doses of alcohol (EtOH 2.25, EtOH 4.5, EtOH 6.5 g/kg/day) or control conditions (maltose dextrin solution or no treatment) from embryonic day 1 (E1: sperm positive) to E20. On E33 (usually postnatal day 10), all pups were perfused. Their brains were removed, dissected into forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem, and weighed. Blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were measured on 4 different days of gestation, but the peak BACs across gestation for the three alcohol-treated groups averaged 142, 294, and 413 mg/dl for the EtOH 2.25, EtOH 4.5, and EtOH 6.5 g/kg groups, respectively. Analysis of the body weight data indicated that pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group had a greater somatic growth deficit than pups from all other groups. Although the whole brain, forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem weights of pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group were significantly smaller than those in the control groups, within-treatment group analyses indicated that the cerebella of pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group were more severely affected than were their forebrains or brainstems. The analyses of the brain region to body weight ratios revealed again that the cerebellum-to-body-weight ratio of pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group was more severely affected than the forebrain or brainstem to body weight ratios. Collectively, these data lend support to the view that gross regions of the brain are differentially vulnerable to alcohol insult during the first two trimesters equivalent, and suggest that the cerebellum is vulnerable to injury from exposure to high BACs during a developmental period other than the third trimester equivalent.

A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Background: It is widely known that prenatal alcohol exposure is related to cognitive and behavioral deficits throughout childhood and adolescence. Much research has focused on understanding and quantifying the cognitive profile of children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) with relatively less empirical research on behavioral or psychosocial adjustment. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral and psychosocial profile of children exposed to heavy amounts of alcohol prenatally. Method: Two groups of subjects were evaluated: an alcohol-exposed group (ALC) and a nonexposed control group (NC) each made up of 32 subjects matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. The alcohol-exposed group consisted of children heavily exposed to alcohol in utero, including 19 children diagnosed with FAS. The Personality Inventory for Children (PIC) was completed by the caretaker of each child. Four validity/screening scales and 12 clinical scales were scored for all subjects. Results: Analyses revealed significant group differences on four validity/screening scales and 12 substantive scales. Within the ALC group, the profile of children without FAS was similar to that of children with FAS, with the exception that their profiles were consistent with less cognitive impairment. Conclusions: These findings indicate that in addition to previously reported cognitive impairments, heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is related to significant impairments in psychosocial functioning. Even children without alcohol-related physical anomalies suffer from impaired psychosocial functioning. Because impairments of this nature can interfere with functioning across multiple domains, effective early intervention programs should be considered for families of alcohol-exposed children. Furthermore, given the similarities of alcohol- exposed children with and without FAS, it is imperative to obtain prenatal alcohol exposure histories on all children experiencing cognitive or psychosocial deficits.

N2  - Background and Objective: Liver transplantation for terminal liver failure enables patients to look forward to many years of good quality life. As a result, more and more of the often still relatively young transplant recipients enquire about the possible risks to a child procreated after transplantation. Patients and methods: During 9.5 years (between September 1988 and April 1998) 1000 liver transplantations were performed on 911 patients (374 females, 537 males) at our hospital. The potential for parenthood existed for 163 women (aged between 16 an 46 years) and 520 men. 14 children were born of 14 women, six pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion or miscarriage and three other women are now pregnant. Seven men reported paternity of eight children after transplantation. All data were collected prospectively. Results: Six of the 14 births (42.9%) proceeded normally, but up to three complications developed in the other eight (57.1%). Six women (35.7%) developed hypertension during the pregnancy. There was no case of transplant dysfunction or toxaemia of pregnancy. Half the births were by caesarian section. Premature births occurred in two women (14.3%); four children were underweight (< 2500 g) at birth (28.6%). The seven men, at a mean age of 44 (7-75) months after transplantation, fathered eight children, at present aged between 11 months and 6 years, all of whom have developed normally. The 13 children of the post-transplantation mothers are also without malformation or abnormal development. One child's development is retarded due to a fetal alcohol syndrome resulting from the mother's post- transplantation alcohol abuse during pregnancy. All the parents are well at present and live with their children. Conclusions: Both men and women can procreate at a relatively low risk to the offspring. But for this to happen, an informed decision for parenthood must be made by the prospective parent together with her/his partner and the doctor in charge, she/he must be in good physical condition with stable transplant function, and there must be frequent interdisciplinary monitoring during any post-transplantation pregnancy.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is currently the major cause of mental retardation in the Western world. Since FAS is not a natural phenomenon and is created by mixing alcohol and pregnancy, the solution to decreasing the incidence of all alcohol-related birth defects is therefore entirely preventable. To date, little is known about the effectiveness of prevention programs in reducing the incidence of FAS. Therefore, it is the intention of this article to review the effectiveness of prevention programs in lowering the incidence of FAS. The present review revealed that prevention programs, to date, have been successful in raising awareness of FAS levels across the groups examined. However, this awareness has not been translated into behavioral changes in 'high risk' drinkers as consumption levels in this group have decreased only marginally, indicating prevention programs have had minimal or no impact in lowering the incidence of FAS. Urgent steps must now be taken to fully test prevention programs, and find new strategies involving both sexes, to reduce and ultimately eliminate the incidence of FAS.

N2  - Background and objective: Maternal alcohol addiction in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE) in children. At present, little is known about the physical, mental, and social long-term consequences in adulthood. Patients and methods: Since 1974, 52 children with FAS and FAE, all born to alcohol dependent mothers, were prospectively followed up from birth to adulthood. Height, weight and head circumferences were based on percentile standards; mental and school development were assessed by school reports and by intelligence subtests. By structural interviews, occupational and social follow-up were assessed. Results: Growth retardation continued mainly in severely affected adults with underweight in 26%, underweight in 30%, and microcephaly in 46%. They mostly lived in foster families, only 6/52 were able to live independently. In 56% special schools for handicapped and mentally disabled were attended. In most cases (37/52), simple occupations without vocational training were practised. Conclusions: It is mainly the neurotoxic effects of alcohol in pregnancy that have longlasting developmental significance in adults. Because of the dysmorphic changes over time, it is difficult to diagnose FAS and FAE only in adulthood.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can result in central nervous system deficits in infants ranging from fetal alcohol effects to fetal alcohol syndrome. Changes in cerebral metabolism causing ischemic in utero conditions can also result from ethanol (EtOH). Growth factors have been shown to ameliorate ischemic damage and EtOH-induced neurotoxicity. However, using an in vitro model system of fetal alcohol effects/fetal alcohol syndrome, this study examines the neuroprotective effects of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor against EtOH treatment (0, 200, 400, 800, or 1600 mg/dl) combined with acute ischemia (2-hour hypoxia in EtOH-containing glucose-free media) followed by chronic hypoglycemia (16-hour glucose deprivation in EtOH-containing media). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assays assessed relative neurotoxicity. Glial cell derived neurotrophic factor was not neuroprotective. Nerve growth factor protected against ischemia/hypoglycemia combined with 0-1600 mg/dl EtOH. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor protected against ischemia/hypoglycemia combined with 0-800 mg/dl EtOH. These studies demonstrate marked growth factor neuroprotection against a myriad of conditions encountered by developing EtOH-exposed fetuses.

T1  - Identification of children with fetal alcohol syndrome and opportunity for referral of their mothers for primary prevention--Washington, 1993-1997
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Heavy maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy can cause permanent birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Although these alcohol-related defects are entirely preventable, the factors associated with maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy are complex and often resistant to change. In addition, not all women who drink heavily will produce children with FAS. Although targeting primary prevention efforts to all women at risk for drinking during pregnancy is ideal, limited resources require targeting women at the highest risk for producing children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. One such population is women who have already given birth to an alcohol-affected child. This high-risk population is not easily identified because not all children with FAS have their condition diagnosed, and these birth mothers are often separated from their children during the first few years of the child's life, often before a diagnosis of FAS has been considered. However, once identified, these women are receptive to intervention. To identify a population of women at highest risk for a future alcohol-exposed pregnancy through diagnosing a previously affected birth child, researchers at the University of Washington developed the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN). This report summarizes the results of this program and documents the feasibility of identifying persons who may have FAS so their condition can be diagnosed and their birth mothers can be identified and referred to prevention services.

N2  - Although Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) rates have been reported to be higher in American Indian populations, no screening tool has been validated for alcohol use in American Indian women. The objectives of this study were to compare the detection of prenatal alcohol use by a self-administered questionnaire to detection by clinical interview; and to ascertain whether the screening tool would increase detection of pregnant women who are abusing alcohol. The hospital records of the women were reviewed for any history of alcohol-related illnesses or injuries to compare with results obtained from the questionnaire. Seventy women attending their first prenatal clinic visit on a reservation were screened for alcohol use. There was a wide range in detection of prenatal alcohol use (20%-71% of the sample detected) depending on the method used. There was a large variation in sensitivities (7%-93%) of the individual questions in identifying patients detected as "high risk" by the clinicians. The T-ACE screening questions significantly increased detection of alcohol use compared to detection by the clinicians (p = 0.04 Fisher's exact test). Due to the large variation between different methods of detection, it is recommended that screening tools that increase detection of alcohol use should be combined with methods of higher specificity such as using questions about quantity and frequency of alcohol intake, medical chart review and clinical interview. We also found that various interpretations of the screening questions by the patients highlighted the need to tailor the wording of individual questions to the particular patient population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE) encompass a pattern of birth defects in persons whose mothers ingested alcohol during pregnancy. People with FAE display fewer of the FAS traits. AIM: To assess the prevalence and features of these affections in a secondary nutritional recovery centre. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All charts of children admitted between 1985 and 1995 were reviewed, and those children diagnosed as having a FAS or FAE by a geneticist were considered for this study. Birth, maternal, social and economic characteristics, psychomotor abilities (using Denver test) and response to nutritional treatment were assessed. RESULTS: During the study period, 1572 infants were admitted to the centre, and 1.97% (70% female) were diagnosed as having a FAS or FAE. These infants were admitted at 11.1 +/- 4.5 months of age and discharged after 96.7 +/- 58.1 months of hospitalisation. Mean mother's age was 33 +/- 7 years, and all belonged to low socioeconomic levels. Mean birth weight was 2048 +/- 431 g and 2469 +/- 619 g in children with FAS and FAE respectively (p < 0.03). Children with FAE performed better for gross and fine motor abilities than those with FAS. No differences were observed for language performance. Sixty five percent of children with FAS and 71% of children with FAE had an adequate weight and height increment during nutritional therapy. A multiple regression analysis showed that age at admission and gestational age were significant predictors of weight gain during therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol has teratogenic effects on the foetus that affect craneal size and psychomotor development. Alcohol also affects pre and post natal growth.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is commonly believed to be the leading known cause of mental retardation in the United States, although surveillance at state and national levels is problematic. The most serious consequence of fetal alcohol exposure is central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. While the facial features of FAS become more subtle with age, growth deficits and, particularly, the CNS impairment appear to be permanent. Among factors that affect the risk and severity of fetal alcohol damage are the timing of the alcohol exposure, binge drinking that produces high blood alcohol concentrations, polydrug use, and genetic variations. From various studies, the incidence of FAS ranges from 0.2 to 3.0 affected birth per 1000 live births. The methods of measuring FAS occurrence are fraught with difficulties and inaccuracies, as are surveys of alcohol use by women during pregnancy. Still, indirect studies both in Texas and the United States suggest that the occurrence of FAS is increasing. A first, important step to reducing the incidence of FAS and related problems is to increase the awareness of physicians and other health care providers about the issues of FAS diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Referral and information resources about FAS are provided.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - During pregnancy, the hormonal systems of the mother and fetus are intricately interconnected to ensure normal fetal development. Accordingly, maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can interfere with fetal development, not only directly, through adverse effects exerted by alcohol that crosses the placenta and enters the fetal bloodstream, but also indirectly, by disturbing the functions and interactions of maternal and fetal hormones. In both the mother and the fetus, alcohol exposure can impair the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which regulates the body's response to stress; the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which controls reproductive functions; and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, which regulates the metabolism of almost all tissues. In addition, alcohol can interfere with the activities of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors, which promote body growth and activity. Some of the effects of maternal alcohol consumption on fetal hormone systems may contribute to the adverse effects observed in children with fetal alcohol syndrome and related disorders.

N2  - Understanding the nature of cognitive deficits among adolescent patients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) can direct future research on assessment and intervention. In an exploratory study, nine nonretarded teenagers with FAS were administered tests of IQ and adaptive behavior, and neuropsychological tests presumed sensitive to alcohol effects. Their performance was compared with psychometric norms and to data from a sample of 174 adolescents with minimal or no prenatal alcohol exposure. These nonretarded FAS patients commonly showed behavior problems, decreased social competence, and poor school performance. Neuropsychological testing revealed significant deficits, although no one neuropsychological profile characterized all patients and not all tests revealed problems. Relatively intact performance was observed in procedural memory, some measures of reaction time, and some reading measures. Deficits were seen on attentional and memory tasks tapping visual-spatial skills, short-term auditory attention and memory, declarative learning, and cognitive flexibility and planning. Difficulties in processing speed and accuracy were also seen. Comparison with a subgroup of 52 nonalcohol-exposed or minimally alcohol-exposed adolescents with a similar range of IQ scores demonstrated that deficits among these FAS patients were not fully explained by a general lowering of IQ.

T1  - What do physicians know and say about fetal alcohol syndrome: A survey of obstetricians, pediatricians, and family medicine physicians
A1  - Abel E.L.
A1  - Kruger M.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Pediatricians, obstetricians, and family practice physicians in Michigan were surveyed by mail for their knowledge and opinions about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE). Physicians said that about 67% of their patients raised questions about drinking during pregnancy but only 2% specifically referred to FAS or FAE. Most physicians were uncertain about whether their colleagues were sufficiently aware of FAS, whether FAS could be diagnosed at birth, or if physicians were acquainted with the syndrome's major criteria. However, most believed FAS was not being overdiagnosed and believed that making a diagnosis of FAS at birth could lead to improved treatment of an affected child. Physicians also believed that physician counseling was a more effective way of reducing the incidence of FAS/FAE than warning labels. Forty-one percent of the physicians placed the threshold for FAS at one to three drinks per day and 38% placed the threshold at one or fewer drinks a day. Thirty-five percent placed the estimated incidence of FAS at 1 to 2 per 1000 in the United States. We conclude that physicians are in relative agreement about the effects of drinking during pregnancy and the value of physician counseling but are misguided as to what constitutes a true risk level of drinking as far as the etiology of FAS is concerned.

T1  - Diagnosing moral disorder: The discovery and evolution of fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Armstrong E.M.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was invented in 1973. This paper investigates the process by which a cluster of birth defects associated with exposure to alcohol in utero came to be a distinct medical diagnosis, focusing on the first ten years of the medical literature on FAS. Fetal alcohol syndrome was 'discovered' by a group of American dysmorphologists who published the first case reports and coined the term FAS. However, the nature of the diagnosis and its Salient symptoms were determined collectively over time by the medical profession as a whole. The paper traces the natural history of the diagnosis in the U.S. through five stages: introduction, confirmation and corroboration, dissent, expansion, and diffusion. FAS serves as an example of the social construction of clinical diagnosis; moral entrepreneurship plays a key role and the medical literature on FAS is infused with moral rhetoric, including passages from classical mythology, philosophy, and the Bible. FAS is a moral as well as a medical diagnosis, reflecting the broader cultural concerns of the era in which it was discovered, including a greater awareness of environmental threats to health, the development of fetal medicine, an emphasis on 'the perfect child,' and a growing paradigm of maternal-fetal conflict.

N2  - A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was performed with forty-six 5- to 9-year-old children exposed to alcohol in utero for varying durations. The children were subdivided according to duration of maternal alcohol abuse, as follows: during trimester I (n = 16), during trimesters I and II (n = 16), and throughout pregnancy (n = 14). A control group (n = 26) consisted of unexposed children. Fetal alcohol exposure throughout pregnancy had significant, diffuse effects on the development of the children, whereas exposure only during early pregnancy did not. Observed cognitive deficits included problems in naming, receptive language, attention, and visual-motor functions. Verbal and visual memory and manual motor precision did not significantly differ between the groups.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Alcohol is the most common identifiable teratogenic cause of mental retardation in North America. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a major public health problem, which is frequently under diagnosed by physicians. Objective: To identify and quantify the maternal risk factors and neonatal characteristics of children with FAS. Design: a retrospective case-control study using birth certificate data of North Dakota children diagnosed with FAS. Five controls were selected for each patient. Controls were selected from the computerized birth registry and matched by gender, gear and month of birth. Subjects and setting: A list of all the children diagnosed with FAS from the North Dakota FAS Registry was sent to the State Health Department. We were able to locate the birth certificates for 132 (56%) of the 228 cases on the registry. Results: Of the 132 FAS cases, 106 (80.3%) were Native Americans and 24 (18.2%) were Caucasians. In this sample 51 (38.6%) of the cases were male and 81 (61.4%) were female. Statistically significant maternal characteristics at p < 0.01 were: older mother's age, lower education level, fewer months of prenatal care, fewer prenatal visits, lower gestational age at time of delivery and less prenatal weight gain. Significant neonatal differences at p < 0.01 were lower birth weight and Apgar scores and higher incidence of congenital malformations. Conclusion: FAS is a completely preventable developmental disability. Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can result in lifelong physical and mental impairments on the fetus. All pregnant women should be screened for alcohol use during prenatal visits. Women with positive screens or at high risk should be identified early by the primary care physician and referred for treatment and counseling.

N2  - Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome in the end of the 1960s, substantial evidence has accumulated on a number of adverse effects that alcohol consumption during pregnancy may have on the fetus. Long-term effects on child development has also been observed. Although the various types of effects are well documented, less is known about threshold levels of consumption, under which there is no risk of damage. Few studies have assessed the risk associated with high episodic drinking. From a theoretical point of view, binge drinking in critical stages in organ formation may constitute a particularly high risk for adverse outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize for clinicians recent epidemiologic evidence regarding medical risks of alcohol use for women. METHODS: MEDLINE and PsychINFO, 1990 through 1996, were searched using key words 'women' or 'woman,' and 'alcohol.' MEDLINE was also searched for other specific topics and authors from 1980 through 1996. Data were extracted and reviewed regarding levels of alcohol consumption associated with mortality, cardiovascular disease, alcohol-related liver disease, injury, osteoporosis, neurologic symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, fetal alcohol syndrome, spontaneous abortion, infertility, menstrual symptoms, breast cancer, and gynecologic malignancies. Gender-specific data from cohort studies of general population or large clinical samples are primarily reviewed. MAIN RESULTS: Women develop many alcohol-related medical problems at lower levels of consumption than men, probably reflecting women's lower total body water, gender differences in alcohol metabolism, and effects of alcohol on postmenopausal estrogen levels. Mortality and breast cancer are increased in women who report drinking more than two drinks daily. Higher levels of alcohol consumption by women are associated with increased menstrual symptoms, hypertension, and stroke. Women who drink heavily also appear to have increased infertility and spontaneous abortion. Adverse fetal effects occur after variable amounts of alcohol consumption, making any alcohol use during pregnancy potentially harmful. CONCLUSIONS: In general, advising nonpregnant women who drink alcohol to have fewer than two drinks dally is strongly supported by the epidemiologic literature, although specific recommendations for a particular woman should depend on her medical history and risk factors.

T1  - Prevention of alcohol abuse-related birth effects - I. Public education efforts
A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can result in a pattern of anomalies in children called 'fetal alcohol syndrome' (FAS) and more recently, 'fetal alcohol abuse syndrome (FAAS)'. FAAS as well as individual alcohol-related anomalies, called 'alcohol abuse-related birth effects' (AARBEs), are widely considered to be totally preventable, because they stem from a behaviour that is presumably modifiable. However, current strategies to reduce their occurrence are more palliative than preventive, because their underlying premise, viz. that raising public awareness of the potential dangers of commonly used substances such as alcohol is enough to reduce their use, lacks empirical support. Moreover, in some cases they are also counter-productive. After considering the relevant literature, this review contends that 'universal' public education efforts will only be effective in reducing FAAS and AARBEs if they focus on the cause of these disorders, which is alcohol abuse rather than the currently open-ended message that any amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy constitutes a danger to an unborn child. This argument lays the ground work for an alternative and more pragmatic strategy set forth in the following paper for preventing FAAS and AARBEs.

N2  - Objective: To examine the relative importance of prenatal alcohol exposure and family history of alcoholism for the prediction of adolescent alcohol problems. Method: In 1974-75, a population-based, longitudinal prospective study of alcohol and pregnancy began with self-report of alcohol use by pregnant women. In a 14-year follow-up, 439 parents provided information on the family history of alcohol problems for these adolescent offspring. The 14-year-old adolescents provided information on the frequency and quantity of their own alcohol consumption within the past month, on the consequences of their drinking over the past 3 years, and on their age at first intoxication. Additional covariates were assessed prenatally and at follow-up. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was more predictive of adolescent alcohol use and its negative consequences than was family history of alcohol problems. Prenatal exposure retained a significant predictive effect even after adjustment for family history and other prenatal and environmental covariates. By contrast, the nominally significant correlation of family history with adolescent drinking is weaker after adjustment for prenatal alcohol exposure and disappears entirely after adjustment for other relevant covariates. We observed no evidence for an interactive effect of fetal exposure and family history in predicting adolescent alcohol use. Conclusions: Fetal alcohol exposure is a risk factor for adolescent alcohol involvement and alcohol-related problems and may account for variance in prediction of problems otherwise attributed to family history of alcoholism. Studies of alcoholism etiology and family history need to include consideration of even modest levels of fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - This research aimed to develop a Fetal Alcohol Behavior Scale (FABS) that describes the behavioral essence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), regardless of age, race, sex, and IQ. Using a reference sample of 472 diagnosed patients with FAS or FAE, ages 2 to 51, five studies are described. The FABS demonstrates high item-to-scale reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91) and good test-retest reliability (r = 0.69) over an average interval of 5 years. It identifies many of the subjects with known or presumed prenatal alcohol exposure in detection studies using both prison and general samples. FABS scores also predict dependent living among adult patients with FAS/FAE. The FABS is uncorrelated with IQ, sex, age, race, and diagnosis (FAS versus FAE). We outline areas of further work to define the specificity and utility of this FABS.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and development at preschool age: Main results of a french study
A1  - Larroque B.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Very high levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are harmful for the central nervous system of the child and affect morphogenesis and growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on development at preschool age in a longitudinal study. Pregnant woman were interviewed on their alcohol consumption during pregnancy at their first visit to the maternity hospital of Roubeix, France. The development of their 160 children was assessed at the age of 4 1/2. Multiple regression analyses indicated that consumption of 1.5 oz of absolute alcohol (approximately 3 drinks) or more during pregnancy was significantly related to a decrease of 7 points on the general cognitive index of the McCarthy scales, after controlling for confounders. This level of consumption was also related to a higher score on minor neurological anomalies, a lower height of the child, and the higher score on facial features. This level of 1.5 oz of absolute alcohol/day should not be interpreted as a biological threshold, because the study does not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the effects of lower levels of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can affect the development of the child, at levels well below those associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a devastating developmental disorder caused by prenatal exposure to high amounts of alcohol. In addition to structural abnormalities and growth deficits, fetal alcohol syndrome is associated with a broad spectrum of neurobehavioral anomalies. This paper reviews the behavioral and cognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. More than 20 years of research are discussed, with a focus on IQ, activity, attention, learning, memory, language, motor, and visuospatial abilities in children prenatally exposed to varying amounts of alcohol, including those with fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) produces profound alterations in immunological and neuroendocrine functions. The present study examined the effects of FAE on the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and corticosterone following administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in normal (N) adult rats, in adult offspring of dams fed a liquid diet supplemented with ethanol (E), and in pair-fed control offspring (P). LPS-induced TNF-alpha secretion was not affected by either gender or prenatal treatment. In contrast, LPS-induced corticosterone secretion was significantly greater in female than in male rats, and at 60-min post-LPS was significantly higher in E and P, compared to N females. Ovariectomy significantly inhibited LPS- induced TNF-alpha secretion in E, but not in P and N, rats and chronic replacement with 17-beta-estradiol markedly inherited TNF-alpha secretion in ovariectomized E and N, but not in P, rats. In contrast, ovariectomy reduced the effects of LPS on corticosterone secretion in all groups, and chronic replacement with 17-beta-estradiol reversed this effect. These findings indicate that LPS-induced secretion of corticosterone, but not TNF-alpha, is affected by prenatal manipulations and by gender. In addition, alterations in the hormonal environment in females modulate LPS-induced corticosterone secretion in all prenatal treatment groups, but differentially influence TNF- alpha secretion in rats exposed to alcohol, restricted feeding, or normal diets in utero.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The most devastating teratogenic effect of alcohol on the unborn child is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is a permanent birth defect that results in lifelong disruptions in cognitive, linguistic and social development. One of the most debilitating effects of prenatal alcohol exposure involves the development and use of social communication. Deficits in social communication jeopardize academic success and appear to play a major role in the maladaptive and dysfunctional behaviours present in older school-age children and adolescents with FAS. The ability to manage longer units of social discourse is a defining feature of adolescent language. Narratives are extended texts that occur frequently in the language of the classroom and in a variety of meaningful social contexts. The demands of narratives provide clinicians with a window of opportunity from which to examine the social-communicative processes of youngsters with FAS. In this paper we introduce an experimental protocol that has been designed to sample narrative discourse using a wordless picture book as the eliciting stimulus. Spoken narratives are scored for their cohesion (i.e. linking related events into logical networks) and coherence (i.e. informativeness). The clinical utility of the protocol is demonstrated and discussed, with a case presentation of two adolescents with FAS and a sample of typically developing peers.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: A Japanese perspective
A1  - Tanaka H.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - To estimate and prevent the effects of prenatal alcohol on the central nervous system (CNS), brain dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE) was compared by both epidemiological and experimental studies. The FAS infants exhibited a more severe degree of CNS involvement than the FAE infants. The CNS involvement features were developmental delay and intellectual impairment in both FAS and FAE. The increased risk of low birth weight and CNS involvement were much more significant in women who were heavy drinkers or alcoholics and smoked. The beneficial effect of supplementary zinc on the fetal cerebrum of FAS or FAE rats was limited, never reaching the unexposed control level. One of the most vulnerable structures in the rat fetus exposed to ethanol in utero was the synaptic formation in the hippocampus. The consistent dysmorphogenesis of synapses during early brain development may be associated with the functional impairment of the CNS in FAS and FAE.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with behavioral and cognitive deficits. However, the majority of children born to alcohol-abusing women do not meet the formal criteria for FAS and it is not known if the cognitive abilities of these children differ from those of children with FAS. Using a set of neuropsychological tests, 3 groups were compared: (a) children with FAS, (b) children without FAS who were born to alcohol-abusing women (the PEA group), and (c) normal controls. The results indicated that, relative to controls, both the FAS and the PEA groups were impaired on tests of language, verbal learning and memory, academic skills, fine-motor speed, and visual- motor integration. These data suggest that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a consistent pattern of neuropsychological deficits and the degree of these deficits may be independent of the presence of physical features associated with FAS.

T1  - Birth weight and congenital anomalies following poisonous mushroom intoxication during pregnancy

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - A series of 22 women who suffered from mushroom poisoning while pregnant have been identified among adults receiving treatment between 1960 and 1993 in a specialist clinic in Budapest, Hungary. In most cases, the poisonings were attributed to Amanita phalloides, verna, and related species. Of these, 20 went to term, and data were collected on gestational age, birth weight, and both major and minor congenital anomalies. Mean birth weight (but not gestational age) was lower than in the control series, suggesting that maternal poisoning may have led to intrauterine growth retardation. Two children were identified with major abnormalities (one of whom had fetal alcohol syndrome related to alcohol abuse by the mother). The prevalences of both major and minor anomalies were similar to the prevalence in the matched control group and to the rate in a more recent control series examined according to the same protocols. However, the statistical power to detect teratogenic effects is limited, especially as only five of the mothers suffered the poisoning episode during the first trimester.

T1  - Surveillance for fetal alcohol syndrome using multiple sources -- Atlanta, Georgia, 1981-1989
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy and is characterized by specific anomalies of the face; prenatal and postnatal growth deficits; and a variety of central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, including mental retardation. Children with either full or partial FAS often incur severe and costly secondary disabilities. Despite the importance of surveillance for establishing the magnitude of FAS and in monitoring trends in the occurrence of this disease, population-based surveillance for FAS has been difficult because the syndrome can be diagnosed only by clinical observation and often is not recognized until after the child reaches school age. Although most FAS surveillance has been based on diagnoses among newborns, most (89%) cases (full FAS and partial FAS) are diagnosed after the age of 6 years. To develop a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of FAS in a defined population, in 1997 CDC linked data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) and the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP) for children born in Atlanta during 1981-1989 (the most recent birth year for which data were available for 3-10-year-olds). This report presents a multiple-source method for FAS surveillance that is more complete than previous methods and that enables comparison of rates between states.

T1  - Alcohol consumption among pregnant and childbearing-aged women--United States, 1991 and 1995
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Moderate to heavy alcohol use by women during pregnancy has been associated with many severe adverse effects in their children, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)--with facial dysmorphology, growth retardation, and central nervous system deficits--and other neurodevelopmental effects. Early prenatal alcohol exposure can occur unintentionally (i.e., before a woman knows she is pregnant); in addition, women who drink at high levels before pregnancy are at increased risk for drinking during pregnancy. Ongoing surveillance for alcohol consumption among pregnant and childbearing-aged women is important for monitoring the impact of efforts to prevent this risk behavior. This report analyzes and compares data from the 1995 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and previously reported 1991 BRFSS data for women aged 18-44 years, and presents the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women and overall and state-specific prevalence rates among women of childbearing age. The findings indicate a substantial increase in alcohol use among pregnant women from 1991 to 1995.

N2  - The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) utilizes a population-based survey of Oklahoma women with a recent live birth to examine the rates of alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. Nearly one-half of Oklahoma women report using alcohol during the three months before pregnancy and one in thirteen women consume alcohol during the three months prior to delivery. Moderate to heavy alcohol use before pregnancy was associated with additional perinatal risk factors including unintended pregnancy, inadequate prenatal care, smoking, and physical abuse. Health providers play an important role in the prevention of alcohol related birth impairments such as fetal alcohol syndrome through early detection of problem drinking, patient education and appropriate referrals. However, one in four Oklahoma mothers report their health care provider did not talk to them about the harmful effects alcohol can have on their baby.

T1  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Larkby C.
A1  - Day N.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol during gestation can cause persistent abnormalities in physical and cognitive development. Children who meet the clinical definition of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) are small for their age, exhibit characteristic facial anomalies, and demonstrate deficits in central nervous system development. Alcohol effects in children with prenatal exposure, but not FAS, are similar, although of smaller magnitude and not necessarily present in all three systems. The degree to which a person is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure depends on the amount, timing, and duration of the mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy as well as maternal characteristics (e.g., age and comorbid psychiatric disorders) and environmental factors (e.g., socioeconomic status and family problems). Some exposure-related effects, such as growth deficits, are directly related to the amount of alcohol consumed, however, so that even a small amount of alcohol may affect child development. Therefore, the best policy continues to be abstinence during pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To assess general intellectual functioning in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with or without the facial features and growth deficiencies characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Design: Forty-seven alcohol-exposed children were recruited on evaluation at a dysmorphology clinic and evaluated as part of a university research project using standard tests of IQ. Thirty-four of the alcohol- exposed patients met the traditional diagnostic criteria for FAS. The other 13 alcohol-exposed children lacked both the pattern of facial features and prenatal or postnatal growth deficiency characteristic of the diagnosis. Results: Compared with normal control subjects matched for age, sex, and ethnicity, both groups of alcohol-exposed children displayed significant deficits in overall IQ measures and deficits on most of the subtest scores. Although those in the nondysmorphic group usually obtained marginally higher IQ scores than those in the FAS group, few significant differences were found between the two alcohol-exposed groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that high levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are related to an increased risk for deficits in intellectual functioning and that these can occur in children without all of the physical features required for a diagnosis of FAS. They also emphasize the need for conducting a thorough history of prenatal alcohol exposure in children with intellectual deficits.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - PURPOSE: Heavy drinking during pregnancy is an established risk factor for fetal alcohol syndrome and other adverse perinatal outcomes. However, there is still debate as to the effects of low-to-moderate drinking during pregnancy. METHODS: This prospective investigation was based on 2714 singleton live births at Yale-New Haven Hospital during 1988-1992. Alcohol drinking during pregnancy was evaluated with respect to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preterm delivery, and low birthweight. RESULTS: Mild drinking, defined as > 0.10-0.25 oz of absolute alcohol per day, during the first month of pregnancy was associated with a protective effect on IUGR (OR, 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.76). Overall, drinking during month I of pregnancy suggested a curvilinear effect on growth retardation, with consumption of > 1.00 oz of absolute alcohol per day showing increased risk. Drinking during month 7 was associated with a uniform increase in the odds of preterm delivery; the ORs were 2.88 (95%'CI, 1.64-5.05) for light drinking and 2.96 (95% CI, 1.32-6.67) for mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the risk estimates for IUOR and preterm delivery may indicate etiological differences that Warrant further investigation of these outcomes and critical periods of exposure. Low birthweight is not a useful neonatal outcome for this exposure because it is a heterogeneous mix of preterm delivery and IUGR. Despite the observed protective effects of mild drinking on IUGR, the increased risk of preterm delivery with alcohol use supports a policy of abstinence during pregnancy.

T1  - DNA damage, DNA repair, and alcohol toxicity - A review
A1  - Brooks P.J.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Alcohol (ethanol) is clearly a toxic substance when consumed in excess. Chronic alcohol abuse results in a variety of pathological effects, including damage to the liver and brain, as well as other organs, and is associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancers. Alcohol consumption by pregnant women can result in fetal alcohol effects and fetal alcohol syndrome. All of these toxic effects are well documented. What is needed at present is a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which alcohol causes these toxic effects. Such an understanding may lead to better treatments of some of these toxic effects. This review, focuses on the possibility that toxic effects of ethanol are mediated at least in part, by damage to DNA. In particular, I emphasize data on the production of endogenous DNA-damaging molecules as a result of alcohol consumption and metabolism. Specific examples of DNA-damaging molecules to be considered are reactive oxygen species, including oxygen radicals, lipid peroxidation products, and acetaldehyde. The relevant DNA repair pathways that protect cells against DNA damage produced by these molecules will also be reviewed. The goal of this review is to integrate recent results from the fields of mutagenesis and DNA repair with the alcohol toxicity literature, with the aim of stimulating research into the role of DNA damage in different types of alcohol toxicity and the role of DNA repair in protecting cells from alcohol related damage.

N2  - Objective: To examine the association of moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure with learning and behavior in early adolescence. Method: A population-based cohort of 464 children were followed longitudinally from birth to age 14 years. Alcohol exposure was assessed via in-depth maternal self-report in the fifth month of pregnancy. At age 14, learning and behavior were assessed with multiple measures, tapping parent, teenager, and psychologist viewpoints, drawn from adolescent laboratory examination and parent phone interview. The underlying pattern of association between prenatal alcohol and adolescent outcome was detected using partial least- squares statistical techniques; confounding factors were dealt with by regression methods. Results: Analyses revealed a statistically significant, subtle relationship between greater prenatal alcohol use and increased behavior/learning difficulties during adolescence, even after accounting for other developmental influences. 'Binge' maternal drinking and exposure early in pregnancy were associated with a profile of adolescent antisocial behavior, school problems, and self-perceived learning difficulties. Conclusions: Fetal alcohol exposure (even at 'social drinking' levels) is associated with developmental difficulties in adolescence that are consistent with problems seen earlier in life. Clinicians should understand the potential role prenatal alcohol exposure plays in behavioral and cognitive problems.

T1  - Variation in induction of human placental CYP2E1: Possible role in susceptibility to fetal alcohol syndrome?
A1  - Rasheed A.
A1  - Hines R.N.
A1  - McCarver-May D.G.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in less than 10% of women who drink heavily during pregnancy. One potential mechanism for this intersubject variation is differences in placental alcohol metabolism, Alcohol dehydrogenase is present at low concentrations in the placenta and is not inducible. CYP2E1 has not been found in human placentas at early gestation time points or in random term placentas. Hepatic CYP2E1 is induced by alcohol and other environmental agents, but induction varies among heavy drinkers and may be genetically controlled. To test whether CYP2E1 is induced in placenta by heavy drinking during pregnancy, we performed a Western blot analysis on placental microsomes from women (n = 8) whose periconceptional average daily absolute alcohol intake was greater than 1 ounce. Using anti-human CYP2E1, bands consistent with CYP2E1 were identified in six samples, although considerable variation among individuals was observed. Among drinking mothers, offspring head size was smaller among those with placental CYP-2E1 (p = 0.04). The association between the presence of the protein and smaller birth weight and birth length was equivocal (p = 0.09). Our data are consistent with placental CYP2E1 being inducible by drinking, but with induction being variable among heavy drinking women. We speculate intersubject variation in induction may have a genetic basis and may play a role in susceptibility to alcohol related defects.

N2  - Background: Chronic alcoholism in pregnant animals and humans lead to general growth impairment in their offspring, which show multiple birth defects and delayed grown (fetal alcohol syndrome). Here we study the maturation of the intestine under the effect of chronic exposure to ethanol in utero together with associated malnutrition. Methods: Lactase, acid beta- galactosidase, maltase, and alkaline phosphatase activity profiles were monitored in 18-, 19-, 20-, and 21-day-old fetuses from rats kept under three nutritional treatments before and during gestation: alcohol-treated (25% ethanol in drinking water), fiber-treated (50% cellulose-diluted diet) as a control of the malnutrition associated with chronic alcoholism, and control or normal diet. Serum corticosterone determination and lactase immunolocalization were carried out. To detect possible direct effects of ethanol during the period of mucosa development, intestinal explants from 18- , 19-, and 20-day-old control fetuses were cultured either in the basal medium alone or in a medium containing 25 mM ethanol for 72, 48, and 24 h of incubation, respectively. Results: Following chronic ethanol exposure in utero, intestinal weight and brush-border protein content and the specific activities of lactase, acid beta-galactosidase, maltase, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly lower than those of nutritional controls. Organ culture results, under the assay conditions stated, did not show a direct effect of ethanol 25 mM on prenatal mucosal functionality. Conclusions: All these results suggest that maternal malnutrition is not primarily responsible for the impaired intestinal maturation in rat fetuses from alcohol-treated mothers; indirect effects of ethanol and/or its derivatives throughout embryo-fetal development could be necessary to promote this intestinal delay.

T1  - The teratogenic effects of alcohol following exposure during pregnancy, and its influence on the chromosome constitution of the pre-ovulatory egg
A1  - Kaufman M.H.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Much information has emerged over the years concerning the teratogenicity of acute and chronic alcohol exposure during pregnancy. Both alcohol and its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, are teratogenic. Exposure during pregnancy may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and this is said to occur in a substantial proportion of infants born to mothers who are chronic, heavy daily drinkers. Such infants usually survive to birth but are mentally retarded, often display growth retardation and additionally display a characteristic range of clinical features, principally craniofacial abnormalities and neurological damage. We have recently been interested in the effect of exposure of pregnant female mice to a single high level of alcohol during pregnancy, equivalent to an episode of 'binge' drinking, on the optic nerve, and believe that our findings, which are outlined in the first part of this review, may shed important light on the pathogenesis of some of the ocular features characteristically seen in infants with this syndrome. What is not generally appreciated, is that exposure to alcohol and other 'spindle-active' substances that have a similar action on the meiotic spindle apparatus during the menstrual cycle before conception can induce chromosome segregation errors in the ovulated oocyte. The successful fertilization of such eggs consequently results in the production of aneuploid embryos, which have a very high chance of being spontaneously aborted during the first trimester of pregnancy. Those relatively few aneuploid conceptuses that survive to term invariably show moderate to severe degrees of mental retardation, craniofacial and other abnormalities, as well as having a significantly reduced life expectancy. The findings from our experimental studies that have been carried out in mice draw attention to important principles which are of general applicability to the situation in the human. These findings, and our conclusions drawn from them, are discussed in detail in the second part of this review.

N2  - Behavioral deficits are often noted in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure, including mental retardation, learning problems, social problems, and deficits in attention. Because attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been diagnosed so frequently in children with FAS and other alcohol related birth defects, there has been speculation that alcohol is an etiological factor in ADHD. To examine the relationship between behavior characteristics of children with fetal alcohol exposure and those seen in children with a diagnosis of ADHD, 149 low socioeconomic status (SES), African-American children (mean age = 7.63 years) were given a battery of neuropsychological and behavioral tests. One hundred and twenty-two were a subsample from a longitudinal study of prenatal alcohol exposure, whereas twenty-seven were identified in an ADHD Clinic. Children were given two sets of teats: (1) 'traditional model' of conventional behavioral and psychiatric measures of ADHD and externalizing behavior; and (2) measures of neurocognitive functioning reflecting a four-factor model of the neurological basis of the components of attention (Mirsky AF, in Integrated Theory and Practice in Clinical Neuropsychology, Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1989). Results indicated that children with the physical characteristics associated with prenatal alcohol exposure and those with a diagnosis of ADHD had equivalent intellectual abilities with both clinical groups performing more poorly than contrast children from the same SES and ethnic groups. However, there were clear distinctions on behavioral and neurocognitive measures between the two clinical groups with those with ADHD performing more poorly on conventional tests sensitive to attentional problems and conduct disorder. When these two groups were compared on measures designed to measure the model of the four factors of attention by Mirsky, they were noted to have distinct patterns of deficits. These results suggested that the alcohol-affected children did not have the same neurocognitive and behavioral characteristics as children with a primary diagnosis of ADHD.

T1  - Was the fetal alcohol syndrome recognized in the ancient Near East?
A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - One of the most frequently cited examples of ancient prescience concerning the potential dangers of drinking during pregnancy is the story of Samson in the Biblical Book of Judges. The present article examines the relevant passages from this and other related Biblical texts for indications that the ancient Hebrews were indeed aware of alcohol's potential to harm the fetus. This examination was then broadened to include a survey of later Talmudic literature relating to drinking during pregnancy, and literature from Sumerian, Hittite, and Egyptian cultures contemporary with those found in the Bible. No evidence was found for concern in the ancient Near East about any possible harm.

T1  - Corticotropin-releasing hormone and proopiomelanocortin gene expression is altered selectively in the male rat fetal thymus by maternal alcohol consumption
A1  - Revskoy S.
A1  - Halasz I.
A1  - Redei E.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The present study was carried out to investigate how hormonal changes caused by chronic alcohol exposure of rats during the late period of gestation are coordinated with neuroendocrine functions of the fetal thymus, namely thymic expression of CRH and POMC genes. Alcohol consumption by pregnant dams led to a 5-fold elevation of plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels and significantly decreased fetal CORT levels. This generally inverse correlation between maternal and fetal CORT was absent in alcohol-consuming dams and their male fetuses on day 19 of gestation. These day 19 fetuses also had an attenuated plasma testosterone surge that occurred in the male control (pair-fed) fetus on day 19 of embryonic life. Furthermore, fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) resulted in a significant increase in thymic CRH and a decrease in thymic POMC expression in the male fetuses only, specifically on embryonic day 19. Thus, the strong positive correlation between CRH and POMC gene expression in the thymus of pair-fed male and female FAE fetuses was abolished in the FAE males. However, regardless of embryonic age or treatment, a strong positive correlation between thymic POMC gene expression and plasma testosterone levels in the male fetuses was detected. These data suggest that the sexually dimorphic effect of FAE on the fetal thymic POMC and CRH expression in males is driven by testosterone and may be related, therefore, to the presence of alcohol at the time of the prenatal testosterone surge in the male fetuses.

N2  - Several forms of cell perturbation have been associated with ethanol ingestion. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) as well as diminished maxillofacial development and inhibition of cell regeneration in vitro and in vivo have been described. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates maxillofacial growth, DNA synthesis, and it is a potent mitogen for a number of various cell types. EGF exerts its effects on cells through binding to a specific cell surface receptor which leads to activation of a thyrosine kinase in the intracellular part of the receptor. The inhibitory effect of alcohol on EGF in the mouse dental follicle was studied in the offspring of alcoholic mothers using immunocytochemistry. Adult female mice were given 22% alcohol in their drinking water and fed a pelleted diet before and during pregnancy. Maternal blood alcohol levels were 262 +/- 1.3 mg/100 ml on gestation day 12.5. The offspring of the alcoholic and control mice were sacrificed on postnatal day 1.5, their mandibles were dissected, weighed and processed by routine immunocytochemistry with the following results. 1) Significant differences were found in mandible weight p < 0.01 after parturition. 2) The tooth germs in the offspring of ethanol treated mice were morphometrically smaller than those of control littermates. 3) Immunoexpression of EGF in the mandibular first molar of the control group was strong and homogeneous while in the experimental group the expression was light and heterogeneous. It is concluded that maternal alcoholism reduces EGF in the offspring.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: the nurse practitioner perspective
A1  - Quick S.
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause of mental retardation in the United States. The tragedy is that while FAS is irreversible, it is 100% preventable. FAS is caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol is a teratogen and acts in different ways to produce physical and central nervous system malformations and defects in the developing embryo and fetus. FAS is characterized by a history of maternal alcohol ingestion, central nervous system dysfunction, growth deficiencies, and specific physical anomalies. Adolescents and adults with FAS have behavioral problems that differentiate them from other mentally disabled individuals. Nurse practitioners can have an impact on the prevalence of FAS by educating clients about FAS and its relationship to alcohol consumption. NPs need to carefully identify high-risk women and their partners before a pregnancy occurs and assist with interventions to stop active alcoholism or alcohol use during pregnancy. NPs have the capability to decrease the severity of alcohol's effects during pregnancy through education, counseling, and intervention. NPs have the skills to work with case-finding and early identification of infants and children who display signs and symptoms of FAS. With such case-finding, early identification, and prompt referral to the appropriate diagnostic and/or supportive community agencies, individuals with FAS can receive timely intervention to minimize the effects of FAS. Adults with behavioral problems can be assessed for FAS and referred for appropriate assistance as well. Finally, NPs can facilitate public awareness of FAS through educational efforts with individuals, families, and communities.

N2  - The consequences of fetal alcohol exposure are far-reaching and preventable. Health care providers are uniquely positioned to promote alcohol-free pregnancy, yet an array of factors inhibit routine screening, counseling, and referral. This descriptive, qualitative study explored experiences and perceived barriers related to prenatal screening for alcohol use. The study included eight focus groups (71 participants) and 41 key informant interviews with health care professionals representing a mix of disciplines. Nearly 40% of the providers were physicians who regularly encounter women in their practices. While most providers ask about alcohol use, few probe in depth or follow up. The findings should alert program planners and medical educators to strengthen their preventive medical and public health practices.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with a wide variety of cognitive deficits and behavioral problems. Little is known, however, about the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on visuospatial processing. Alcohol-exposed and normal control children were presented with visual hierarchical stimuli consisting of large (global) letters or shapes constructed from the arrangement of numerous smaller (local) letters or shapes. The children were asked first to recall the global-local stimuli and different single-level stimuli from memory and then to copy them. Alcohol-exposed children were impaired in recalling local features relative to global features. When the alcohol-exposed children attempted to copy the same stimuli, there was also a selective deficit in local but not global reproduction. A control condition indicated that the selective deficit in local processing was not due to a size effect per se. These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure does not result in a unitary visual-spatial impairment, but rather, is manifested as a selective deficit in the visual processing of local (detail) features.

N2  - Nulliparous pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to ethanol via a liquid diet technique (FAE, fetal alcohol exposure) or administered a fixed amount of control diet from gestational day 11 to day 21. The offspring, at 2-3 months of age, were studied in tests of mechanically monitored motor activity and learning acquisition in an automatized testing cage requiring an instrumental discriminative response, where the ability to learn and relearn correlations of a light signal to water presentation was monitored. A significantly reduced activity (i.e. ramp mounting behaviour) in a novel situation was obtained in the FAE group compared to controls. The initial disruption of ramp mounting behaviour could reflect alterations in either habituation to a novel test situation, altered neophobia, or some retardation in associating these responses with the outcome of water-availability. Adult FAE rats (six months of age) showed a tendency towards a lowered acquisition performance (p = 0.06) when tested in a circular Morris-type swim maze, but no detectable differences were shown in a motor activity test chamber situation.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure may cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is associated with pre- and postnatal growth retardation. Materials and methods: Spontaneous 24-h growth hormone (GH) secretion was measured in six prepubertal short children with FAS (two boys and four girls) aged 4-14 years. The response to a GH stimulation test, and levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were also measured. Comparisons were made between the children with FAS and healthy children of both normal and short stature, as well as children born small for gestational age (SGA). Results: There were no differences in the mean area under the curve above the baseline or the maximum level of GH during a 24-h period (GH(max)) between the children with FAS and the reference groups. However, the estimated rate of spontaneous 24-h GH secretion in children with FAS was similar to that of children born SGA, but lower than in children of normal stature (p = 0.02). The plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were in the lower parts of the normal range. Conclusion: We conclude that GH secretion in short children with FAS is similar to that in short children born SGA; that is, in the lower range of normal children.

N2  - Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is a known cause of birth defects associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome, but its role in more common, isolated, craniofacial birth defects is not well understood. A population-based, case-control study of orofacial clefts was conducted in Iowa using births during 1987-1991. Cases were identified by the Iowa Birth Defects Registry and classified as having a cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) or cleft palate only (CP) and whether the cleft was isolated or occurred with other birth defects. Controls were selected from normal Iowa births. Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy was classified according to self-reported drinks consumed per month. Results are based on 302 controls and the following numbers in each case group: 118 isolated CLP, 56 isolated CP, 51 CLP with multiple defects, and 62 CP with multiple defects. Compared to women who did not drink alcohol during pregnancy, the relative odds of isolated CLP rose with increasing level of maternal drinking as follows: 1-3 drinks per months, 1.5; 4-10 drinks per month, 3.1; more than 10 drinks per month, 4.7 (chi-square test for trend, P = 0.003). Adjustment for maternal smoking, vitamin use, education, and household income did not substantially alter these results. No significant association was found between alcohol use and isolated cleft palate or clefts in children with multiple birth defects. Alcohol use during pregnancy may be a cause of isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a variety of cognitive deficits, notably in mathematics and higher order processes such as abstraction. An exploratory battery was developed to examine specific types of number processing impairments in 29 adolescent and adult patients with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) relative to controls matched for age, gender, and educational level. The battery included 11 tests: number reading and writing, exact calculation (addition, multiplication, subtraction), approximate calculation (selecting a plausible result for an operation), number comparison, proximity judgment, and cognitive estimation. The results indicated particular difficulties in calculation and estimation tests, with intact number reading and writing ability. The greatest impairment was found in the cognitive estimation test, which is sensitive to frontal lobe lesions. The patterns of deficit described may reflect either the diffuseness of brain damage incurred from prenatal alcohol exposure, or a cumulative deficit in comprehension which may be important for the acquisition of higher-order mathematical abilities.

N2  - Controversy exists whether carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) is valuable as a screening tool for fetal alcohol syndrome. We evaluated serum CDT in 60 non-alcohol-abusing women at different stages of normal pregnancy. CDT was weakly related to week of pregnancy and to human placental lactogen. CDT did not correlate with iron, oestradiol or progesterone. By contrast, good correlations were found between transferrin and week of pregnancy or either sex hormone. Using multiple linear regression analysis, only transferrin and week of pregnancy were important predictors of CDT. The diagnostic accuracy of CDT for detecting alcohol abuse may be limited in pregnant women and should be carefully assessed in relation to alcohol consumption.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome - An ophthalmological and socioeducational prospective study
A1  - Stromland K.
A1  - Hellstrom A.
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Background. The eye is a sensitive indicator of adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Anomalies of the eyes and their adnexa are known to be associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), although long-term effects of these malformations are unknown. Design. A prospective ophthalmologic follow-up (median, 11 years; range, 4 to 19 years) was performed in 25 children with FAS. Their social situation and educational status were also investigated. Results. All but one of the children had ophthalmologic abnormalities. Fundus anomalies were observed in 23 children, of whom 19 had optic nerve hypoplasia. Thirteen children had concomitant strabismus. Microphthalmos, buphthalmos, phthisis, microcornea, coloboma of the iris and uvea, blepharoptosis, cataract, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, and nystagmus were observed in single cases. The dysmorphology of the eyes remained unchanged during the follow-up period. In 2 children with severe mental retardation and, initially, very poor vision, the severe visual handicap persisted. Seventeen children had an initial visual acuity >20/70, which remained unchanged in 10 children and improved in 7 children, despite the presence of optic nerve hypoplasia in 14 of the children. Ten mothers died, 8 of them because of alcohol-related diseases, and only 4 of the mothers were able to take care of their children. Sixteen children went to schools for the mentally retarded, and only 3 children had a normal school education without extra teaching assistance. Conclusions. In children with FAS, the major sequela, ie, brain damage, remains despite extensive medical, educational, and social support. The presence of ophthalmic signs, which persisted but did not deteriorate during the follow-up period, strengthens the diagnosis of FAS, and the high frequency of ocular involvement indicates the importance of a complete ophthalmologic evaluation in children with FAS.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - The risk of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is known to increase with increased maternal age and parity. This study investigated the hypothesis that the deficits in growth and intellectual function seen in non-FAS infants exposed to alcohol at moderate-to-heavy levels are also found disproportionately in the offspring of older mothers. Mothers of 480 African- American, inner-city infants were interviewed at each prenatal clinic visit regarding their use of alcohol during pregnancy. Infants were assessed for physical growth and cognitive development repeatedly through age 13 months. In analyses run separately for the infants of younger and older mothers, alcohol-related deficits were seen most strongly in the offspring of women over 30 years of age. This pattern was not caused by lower levels of drinking by the younger mothers. Age-related increases in maternal body fat-to-water ratio and a faster rate of alcohol metabolism in chronic drinking women may account for the greater vulnerability of the offspring of the older mothers. These data suggest that physiological changes associated with aging and/or chronic drinking may play an important role in the alcohol-related birth defects seen in infants exposed at moderate-to-heavy levels.

N2  - Objective: To determine the knowledge, clinical experience and perceived needs for resource materials of Saskatchewan physicians in regard to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related birth defects. Design: Mailed survey. Setting: Saskatchewan. Participants: All 48 pediatricians and half (394) of the family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) practising in Saskatchewan received a questionnaire. The numbers of physicians who completed it were 24 and 249 respectively. Results: The pediatricians were more likely than the other physicians to be aware of FAS and to have diagnosed at least one case of FAS. Among the FPs and GPs, the year of graduation from medical school was a significant factor in their knowledge of FAS and their diagnostic practices. Those who graduated before 1974, the year FAS was first described in the medical literature, were less likely than the more recent graduates to be aware of FAS and to ask their patients about alcohol use during pregnancy but were more likely to feel comfortable discussing alcohol-related issues in families. All of the groups reported a need for more information about FAS and for resources on alcohol-related issues in general. Conclusions: Saskatchewan physicians are aware of FAS but have expressed a need for more information about FAS, particularly for parents, as well as physician training materials and information about where to refer patients with FAS and parents with alcohol-related problems.

T1  - The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in New Zealand

A1  - Marks R.E.
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - AIMS. To obtain an estimate of the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in New Zealand and to report information on paediatrician surveillance for alcohol related birth defects. METHODS. New Zealand paediatricians were asked to complete a postal survey. Questions recorded the number of children with alcohol related birth defects under their care, and examined the respondents' surveillance for alcohol related birth defects. RESULTS. There were 63 children under 10 years of age with fetal alcohol syndrome under paediatric care in 1993. The majority of paediatricians considered the diagnosis only when risk features were identified: the most frequent being children of high risk mothers and children with dysmorphic features. CONCLUSIONS. Fetal alcohol syndrome exists in New Zealand. The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome as estimated in this study is lower than would be expected from international prevalence reports and is likely to be an underestimate. Current surveillance for alcohol related birth defects depends on an individual paediatrician considering the diagnosis only when faced with a perceived at risk infant or child, and there is likely under recognition. An increased awareness of the risks of alcohol consumption in pregnancy and the full spectrum of alcohol related birth defects is required.

T1  - Use of international classification of diseases coding to identify fetal alcohol syndrome--Indian Health Service facilities, 1981-1992
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States (1). Since 1979, surveillance systems for estimating and tracking FAS have categorized cases using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71 (2). This code comprises noxious influences affecting the fetus or newborn through placenta or breast milk, specifically alcohol, and includes FAS. Because the code is not specific for FAS and may reflect maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy or other adverse effects of alcohol on the fetus, CDC assessed the usefulness of this code in ascertaining FAS cases by reviewing medical records for 1981-1993 from the Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service (IHS) and IHS contract facilities in eight of the 19 tribal or American Indian communities in the area. This report summarizes the findings of the analysis.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) refers to a pattern of birth defects occurring in a subpopulation of children born to women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. The significant medical, social, and economic impact of FAS is increasing. Particularly hard-hit are African-American and native-American women and children. Over the past two decades, basic and clinical research produced voluminous data on ethanol effects on developing organisms. In 1991, Duester and Pullarkat proposed that competition of ethanol with retinol at the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) binding site formed the basis of the FAS mechanism. This competition adversely affects the developing fetus caused by deregulation of retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis essential for proper fetal tissue development. Stated concisely, the FAS hypothesis is: 1. Class I ADH catalyzes the rate-limiting step in oxidation of retinol (ROH) to RA, and ethanol (ETOH) to acetic acid, thus establishing competition for AOH between ROH and ETOH. 2. RA is required as a signal molecule for cell differentiation critical for normal fetal morphogenisis. 3. ADH hinds ingested ETOH, thus deregulating RA homeostasis leading to improper RA signal transduction. Preliminary results from molecular modeling studies of ROH-ADH and ETOH-ADH structures, and physiologic pharmacokinetic modeling confirm the hypothesis with remarkable fidelity.

N2  - Objectives. This study investigated the effect of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on psychomotor development of preschool-age children in a longitudinal study. Methods. Pregnant women were interviewed about their alcohol consumption at their first visit to the maternity hospital in Roubaix, France. Alcohol consumption before pregnancy and during the first trimester was assessed with a structured questionnaire. The psychomotor development of 155 children of these women was assessed with the McCarthy scales of children's abilities when the children were about 4 1/2 years old. Results. Consumption of 1.5 oz of absolute alcohol (approximately three drinks) or more per day during pregnancy was significantly related to a decrease of 7 points in the mean score on the general cognitive index of the McCarthy scales, after gender, birth order, maternal education, score for family stimulation, family status, maternal employment, child's age at examination, and examiner were controlled for. Conclusions. This study showed that moderate to heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy, at levels well below those associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, has effects on children's psychomotor development.

T1  - Is moderate alcohol intake in pregnancy associated with the craniofacial features related to the fetal alcohol syndrome?

N2  - Social drinking in pregnancy is common in many countries despite the fact that alcohol in high doses has teratogenic properties. The public health implications would be appreciable if even moderate alcohol consumption were associated with embryonal or fetal maldevelopment. A presumably sensitive marker of an alcohol effect was used in this study, namely the fetal craniofacial features included in the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The study was based upon self-reported alcohol intake and photographs taken at birth or at 18 months of children born to mothers with a low or moderate alcohol intake during pregnancy. These women were selected during pregnancy by a two-stage sampling from all in well defined regions. Data were available concerning 323 pregnant women and some 200 to 220 children. A short palpebral fissure, a short nose to upper-lip distance and a broad root of the nose were expected to be associated with alcohol intake in early pregnancy, but such an association was only seen between binge drinking and a short palpebral fissure. No associations proved statistically significant at the 18-month examination and any association could merely be secondary to the known association between alcohol and birth weight.

N2  - For 20 years, it has been known that fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with abnormal brain development. Early autopsy studies point to the corpus callosum as one area affected by heavy alcohol exposure. Little is known, however, about the integrity of the brain in alcohol-exposed children who survive the perinatal period. This study was designed to assess the corpus callosum in living children exposed to high doses of alcohol prenatally. Thirteen children with histories of significant prenatal alcohol exposure and 12 normal control children were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. Using the midsagittal section, images were measured for the area of the corpus callosum using a computer-assisted measurement technique. In addition to the overall area, five equiangular regions were determined for each corpus callosum. Of the 13 alcohol-exposed children assessed, two had agenesis of the corpus callosum. The remaining alcohol- exposed children had significantly smaller overall callosal areas, as well as smaller regional areas of four of the five callosal regions, when compared with the normal control children. Importantly, when corrected for brain size, three of the five callosal regions were still smaller in the alcohol-exposed children, although overall area of the corpus callosum was no longer significantly different. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol is associated with abnormalities of the corpus callosum. They verify callosal agenesis in children with FAS, which previously had only been noted in autopsy reports. The current findings further document selective reductions in the area of certain regions of the corpus callosum after in utero alcohol exposure, extending our current understanding of alcohol's teratogenic effects on brain development. There is also some indication that the selective reduction in the area of the corpus callosum is similar to that reported in attention deficit disorder.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol-related birth defects are the result of heavy maternal alcohol consumption during gestation. The magnitude of deficit manifested by the offspring is invariably a consequence of several risk factors that may result in high peak blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), such as the duration, timing, or pattern of alcohol consumption. In addition, the alcohol content of the consumed beverage may play a role in determining offspring developmental consequences. Because higher BACs are positively correlated with risk and severity of brain injury early in postnatal life, initially it was important to determine how BAC is influenced by alcohol concentration and whether that influence is constant over repeated alcohol treatments. Groups of female Sprague-Dawley rate received daily intragastric intubations of 5 g/kg alcohol in one of several concentrations: 45% (v/v), 30% (v/v), 22.5% (v/v), or 15% (v/v) for a duration of 18 consecutive days. Blood samples were taken at various times postintubation on days 3, 8, 13, and 18 of treatment, and analyzed by headspace gas chromatography. Multivariate analyses of peak BAC, average BAC, and time to reach peak BAC revealed some noteworthy results. First, peak BAC and average BAC were significantly lower in the 45% group, compared with the other concentration groups, whereas this group also took a longer time to reach peak BAC than the other three groups. Second, peak BAC and average BAC were higher on the last day of treatment than any of the other treatment days. These results suggest that alcohol concentration and repeated alcohol exposure can influence BAC and, as such, are important risk factors to be considered in the appraisal of alcohol-induced fatal brain injuries.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with a cluster of symptoms called Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with a characteristic pattern of neuroanatomy and biochemical changes. In recent years it has been shown, that stress exposed cells rapidly increase transcription and translation of heat shock protein genes resulting in an increased appearance of these proteins. It has also been found that heat shock proteins, especially the HSP70 family play a role as molecular chaperons maintaining the native conformation of proteins and participating in protein transport in particular cellular compartments. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chronic maternal alcohol consumption on HSP70 content in the different regions of the brain of the newborn rats as well as to examine in vitro the effect of ethanol on HSP70 content in cultured glial cells. Chronic maternal ethanol consumption resulted in increased HSP70 in the following regions of developing brain: hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory bulbs, frontal cortex and septum. Moreover, ethanol applied in vitro, increased HSP70 content in primary astroglial cultures and astrocytes but not in oligodendrocyte cultures. The above described changes may be important in brain maturation and may play a role in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

T1  - Maternal risk factors in fetal alcohol syndrome: Provocative and permissive influences
A1  - Abel E.L.
A1  - Hannigan J.H.
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - We present an hypothesis integrating epidemiological, clinical case, and basic biomedical research to explain why only relatively few women who drink alcohol during pregnancy give birth to children with alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), in particular, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). We argue that specific sociobehavioral risk factors, e.g., low socioeconomic status, are permissive for FAS in that they provide the context for increased vulnerability. We illustrate how these permissive factors are related to biological factors, e.g., decreased antioxidant status, which in conjunction with alcohol, provoke FAS/ARBDs in vulnerable fetuses. We propose an integrative heuristic model hypothesizing that these permissive and provocative factors increase the likelihood of FAS/ARBDs because they potentiate two related mechanisms of alcohol-induced teratogenesis, specifically, maternal/fetal hypoxia and free radical formation.

N2  - Although insulin is known to be an important generator of regulatory signals during fetal growth and development, neither the immediate nor long- term effects of alcohol (ethanol) on insulin action are well understood. In the rat, fetal exposure to alcohol has been shown to be correlated with a subsequent abnormal response to a glucose load in the neonate and adult. Further, fetal hypoplasia secondary to maternal alcohol consumption is correlated with decreased placental glucose transport and with a lowering of the glucose levels in fetal tissues. However, the fetal effects of alcohol cannot be completely overcome by glucose/caloric supplementation, suggesting that factors other than glucose transport are involved. Using an embryonic chick model that negates the factors of maternal/placental metabolism and transport, the current study found that fetal alcohol exposure markedly increased insulin binding in developing tissue, but had little effect on the binding of the insulin-like growth factors. Competitive binding experiments revealed a marked increase in insulin receptor numbers, but no change in binding affinity as a result of the alcohol exposure. Basal uptake of 2- deoxyglucose by fetal tissue was lowered by alcohol exposure, but incubation with exogenous porcine insulin (1 x 10-7 M) resulted in a significant increase in glucose uptake by the alcohol-exposed embryos. The increases in insulin binding and in insulin-dependent glucose uptake notwithstanding, exogenous insulin could not induce normal levels of ornithine decarboxylase activity in embryonic cells previously exposed to alcohol. Furthermore, insulin treatment seemed to inhibit growth in alcohol-exposed whole embryos. Molecular changes in the insulin signaling cascade occurring as the result of alcohol exposure included an increase in specific phosphotyrosine content that was markedly decreased following insulin stimulation. The decrease in phosphotyrosine content did not seem to involve the insulin receptor substrate-1:phosphoinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase complex, because alcohol-treated embryos had significantly elevated basal PI-3 kinase activity that was not altered by insulin exposure. In summary, alcohol-induced growth suppression in the chick embryo is associated with several changes in insulin signaling and thus data suggest that this important mitogenic pathway is impaired as the result of fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome, a syndrome which included growth retardation, mental retardation, and dysmorphic facial features, has been observed only among children of alcoholic mothers, who drank alcohol during pregnancy. But it is now established that consuming about 2 or 3 alcoholic drinks per day during pregnancy can induce permanent damage of the central nervous system, with various functional deficits and delayed mental development. The seriousness of the damage seems to be related to the duration of exposure during pregnancy. Occasional heavy consumptions ('binge' drinking) seem to produce similar effects.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure selectively suppresses cell-mediated but not humoral immune responsiveness
A1  - Gottesfeld Z.
A1  - Ullrich S.E.
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - The present study examined effects of fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) on the ability of peripubertal male and female rats to mount a humoral immune response against T-cell-dependent as well as independent antigens. The appropriate pair-fed (PF) and control (C) cohort rats were included. Serum immunoglobulins (Ig) levels were determined following a primary or secondary immune response. In addition, plasma corticosterone levels were measured in conscious, freely moving FAE, PF and C rats following sensitization with the T-cell-dependent antigen sheep red blood cells (SRBC). The study demonstrates that, in response to primary or secondary immunization, serum Ig levels in FAE rats were not significantly different from those in the PF or C cohorts. On the other hand, a marked reduction in mitogen-induced T-cell proliferative response was observed in FAE male rats in the same age group. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were increased almost four-fold 7 days after the primary immunization with SRBC, but there were no significant differences among the FAE, PF or C groups. Taken together, evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies indicates that FAE is associated with a selective impairment of cell-mediated immune function, including mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation, graft versus host as well as contact sensitization responses, but not of humoral immune function.

N2  - Optic nerve hypoplasia is commonly observed in children affected by the fetal alcohol syndrome, and is believed to contribute to their poor visual acuity. We have used a 'binge' model of alcohol abuse in an attempt to recreate this hypoplasia in a mouse model. Pregnant female (C57BL/6 x CBA)F1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of a 25% solution of ethanol (v:w), either on d 11 or d 12 of gestation. Optic nerves were prepared for transmission electron microscopy from offspring at 3, 6, 9 and 15 wk of age (n = 64). A systematic random sampling technique was used to analyse both the cross-sectional areas of the optic nerves from semithin sections, and the numbers and cross-sectional areas of myelinated axons from thin sections. We found no significant differences either in the cross-sectional area or in the number of axons in the optic nerves between 3 and 9 wk from control and alcohol-treated groups. From 9 to 15 wk, alcohol-treated groups showed a loss of approximately 25% of myelinated axons (65931 +/- 2806-49186 +/- 3194: mean number of axons +/- S.E.M., respectively). Over the same period the number of axons in control groups was relatively stable (62087 +/- 2043-64703 +/- 3607). This resulted in an optic nerve with statistically significantly fewer myelinated axons at 15 wk in the alcohol-treated group, and was reflected in a trend towards a smaller cross-sectional area of the optic nerve in alcohol-treated groups. Analysis of axon calibre distribution within the optic nerves suggested that axons of all sizes were lost between 9 and 15 wk in the alcohol-treated groups. We suggest a delayed trophic mechanism for this late axon loss, and that the term optic nerve atrophy may be a more accurate description of the process.

N2  - Capture-recapture methods were used to estimate the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among Alaska Natives born during the period 1982-1989. Potential cases were identified through an Indian Health Service (IHS) patient case file, a pediatric practice case file, and Medicaid claims from private physicians. A total of 74 Alaska Native children aged 3-10 years were identified with a notation of fetal alcohol syndrome by a physician in a medical record. Because not all of these cases had supporting documentation regarding the syndrome, they were classified as possible cases. Of these possible cases, 50 met all five criteria for chart verification of the syndrome: physician notation of fetal alcohol syndrome, growth deficiency, facial features of the syndrome, central nervous system impairment, and a maternal history of alcohol abuse. These data provided observed prevalence rates of chart-verified fetal alcohol syndrome of 3.1 per 1,000 live births for children born 1982-1985 (age 7-10 years), and 2.0 per 1,000 live births for children born 1986-1989 (age 3-6 years). Capture-recapture analyses were conducted using cases identified by IHS and private physicians. These analyses estimated a prevalence of the syndrome of 3.8 per 1,000 live births for children born 1982-1985, and 3.1 per 1,000 live births for children born 1986-1989. Based on the capture-recapture predicted number of cases, the IHS case file ascertained a greater percentage of cases among the older cohort (75%) than among the younger cohort (56%). These data illustrate the use of capture-recapture analyses in identifying the extent to which observed trends in rates may reflect differences in case ascertainment over time (or by birth cohort). The application of capture-recapture in fetal alcohol syndrome surveillance, however, requires careful attention to the underlying assumptions of capture-recapture methods.

T1  - Frequent alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age--Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1991
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome and other congenital anomalies. Substantial prenatal alcohol use can occur before a woman knows she is pregnant, and teratogenic risk increases if she continues to drink during pregnancy. Characterization of alcohol consumption patterns among women of childbearing age (i.e., age 18-44 years) can help identify the magnitude of this problem, the subpopulations at greatest risk, and the geographic areas in which increased prevention efforts are needed. This report presents state-specific data on the prevalence of frequent alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy often results in disorders of fetal development (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome). The brain appears to be particularly vulnerable, and alcohol abuse during pregnancy is probably the most common cause of acquired mental retardation. We therefore studied the in vitro effects of ethanol on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)- mediated proliferation of rat C6 glioblastoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The proliferation of C6 rat glioblastoma cells was measured in serum-free medium supplemented with specific growth factors in the presence or absence of ethanol. The effect of ethanol on IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, as was the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase content within IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. RESULTS: C6 cells grew slowly in serum-free medium and proliferated in response to IGF-1. Ethanol, at physiologically tolerated concentrations, markedly inhibited the growth of C6 cells in response to IGF-1, but had no effect on the proliferative rate in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor or 1% fetal bovine serum. Inhibition of cell proliferation was evident when ethanol was only present during a 1-hour pulse of IGF-1. Cell growth in the presence of IGF-2 was also prevented by ethanol. The inhibition of IGF-1-mediated cell proliferation was accompanied by abrogation of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation. Ethanol also interfered with the IGF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and the association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with IRS-1. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol inhibit the responses of glial cells to IGF-1, including IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation, IRS-1 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activation, and cell growth.

N2  - In a cohort of 532 pregnant women from the general population, it was found by compilation of the results from interviews, police records, hospital records and social welfare records that 23 mothers and 51 fathers in 64 families (12%) were suffering from alcoholism/heavy drinking. In these 64 families, the mother was an addict in only 13 families, both parents were addicts in 10 families, and in the remaining 41 families only the father was an addict. Pregnancy, delivery, the newborn child and the child's development until their fourth year of life have been described using a multidisciplinary approach and a longitudinal prospective design. An hypothesis on mental and physical development, and the occurrence of psychopathological symptoms in the children was tested. None of the children of the 13 alcoholic mothers was born with foetal alcohol syndrome, but foetal hazard was indicated by lower birth weight and a higher rate of perinatal deaths. Children of alcoholic parents had retarded mental development and showed more behavioural problems until 4 years of age than controls, but the differences related to physical development during the first year of life had then disappeared. Boys were found to be more vulnerable than girls. The consequences of behaviour seemed to be more pronounced when both parents were alcoholics. No obvious deviation was found when only the father was addicted. Regarding mental development, it appears that factors related to parental alcoholism, including genetic and social factors' and the sex of the child, are of greater importance than the neonatal score on reduced optimality.

N2  - The most notable features of fetal alcohol syndrome involve the face and eyes, and include microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, an underdeveloped philtrum and a thin upper lip. Evidence of intrauterine or postnatal growth retardation, mental retardation or other neurologic abnormalities, and at least two of the typical facial features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Newborns with the syndrome may be irritable, with hypotonia, severe tremors and withdrawal symptoms. Mild mental retardation, the most common and serious deficit, and a variety of other anomalies may accompany fetal alcohol syndrome. Sensory deficits include optic nerve hypoplasia, poor visual acuity, hearing loss, and receptive and expressive language delays. Atrial and ventricular septal defects, as well as renal hypoplasia, bladder diverticula and other genitourinary tract abnormalities, may occur. Complete abstinence during pregnancy is recommended, since alcohol consumption in each trimester has been associated with abnormalities, and the lowest innocuous dose of alcohol is not known.

N2  - Little is known about the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. There are even fewer reports on the longitudinal effects of exposure to either marijuana or tobacco during pregnancy. This study is on the 6-year follow-up of 668 children enrolled in the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project. Mothers were interviewed at the 4th and 7th months of pregnancy, and mothers and children were evaluated at delivery, 8, and 18 months, and 3 and 6 years postpartum. At 6 years of age, children who were exposed to alcohol prenatally were significantly smaller in weight, height, head circumference, and palpebral fissure width. These effects on size were mediated by the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the offspring at 8 months. Prenatal alcohol exposure was also significantly associated with maternal reports of the child's appetite at 6 years. There were no effects of prenatal marijuana or tobacco exposure on growth when the children were age 6. There were also no significant relationships between prenatal exposure to alcohol, marijuana, or tobacco and the rate of morphologic anomalies, including the features of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - Ethanol elimination in alcohol-treated pregnant rats

A1  - Lopez-Tejero D.
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - The effects of chronic intake of alcohol on ethanol elimination were studied in 20-day pregnant rats, in their foetuses, and in virgin rats. Experimental animals received ethanol in drinking water (from 10% to 25% in 2 months) (alcohol group), whereas controls drank only water. At the end of chronic exposure, alcohol dehydrogenase activity was determined in stomach and liver and cytochrome P-450 was measured in liver. In a complementary assay, the same experimental groups of rats were given an acute dose of ethanol (2 g/kg body wt, 25% w/v) either intragastrically or intraperitoneally, at the end of the chronic exposure, to determine first-pass ethanol metabolism and pharmacokinetic parameters of its elimination. Significant differences were found between alcohol and control groups for liver and stomach alcohol dehydrogenase activity in pregnant rats. Only in virgins did chronic alcohol treatment significantly increase the liver cytochrome P-450 content. In virgin rats, the first-pass metabolism of ethanol was lower in the alcohol group than in control. By contrast, in control rats, the first-pass of ethanol was lower in pregnant, than in virgin, rats. The metabolic rate of ethanol elimination (mg/kg body wt/hr) was clearly enhanced in alcoholic virgin rats, demonstrating that this model of chronic alcoholism induces metabolic tolerance to ethanol. In alcoholic pregnant rats, a surprisingly low theoretical volume of body ethanol distribution (55 ml/100 g body wt vs. 80 ml/100 g body wt in the other groups) masked their metabolic tolerance to ethanol. This preliminary study should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of chronic or/and acute alcohol intake during pregnancy on the circulating ethanol levels in foetuses and on future development of the foetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to cause damage to the central nervous system. This study sought to further elucidate the structural brain damage that occurs following prenatal alcohol exposure in both children and rats. Two children with histories of maternal alcohol abuse but who did not qualify for a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), based on established criteria, underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Reduced volumes were found for the cerebrum and cerebellum. In addition, the proportional volume of the basal ganglia was reduced, although the proportional volumes of cortical and subcortical fluid, cortical gray matter, limbic and nonlimbic cortex, and diencephalic structures were unaffected. These findings are compared with our recent MRI findings in two cases of FAS. In addition, the caudate-putamen and ventricular areas were assessed in rats exposed to alcohol prenatally. Whereas the overall brain section area was not reduced in size, the area of the caudate-putamen was reduced and that of the ventricles was enlarged.

N2  - It is now well established that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy (greater than 8 units/day; 1 unit = 1/2 pint beer, 1 glass of wine or a single measure of spirits) can result in a child with fetal alcohol syndrome and a more moderate intake has been associated with birth weight reduction, perinatal complications, poor mental development and spontaneous miscarriage. There is little information on the effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption on miscarriage in a British population. Current community surveys estimate that 37 per cent of women of childbearing age (16-44) years) drink more than 5 units each week. This current study describes drinking and smoking patterns in a sample of women who miscarried in the first trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - Peripheral vasodilatation with increased cardiac output, tachycardia and increased blood pressure are described after alcohol administration. An increased HDL-cholesterol is found in moderate drinkers (both HDL-2 and HDL-3 fractions), with diminishing risk of coronary heart diseases. Acute ethanol intake causes an increased the level of triglycerides without changes in HDL-cholesterol level. This may be put into correlation with higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases in so-called "week-end" drinkers. Alcohol abuse may result in central diabetes insipidus. An increased elimination of lactate diminishes tubular secretion of uric acid with subsequent secondary hyperuricemia. Ethanol reduced the number of lymphocytes, reduces phagocytosis by macrophages and diminishes the activity of NK-cells. Bone marrow cellulity diminishes with the subsequent reduction in erythropoiesis, trombopoiesis and leukopoiesis. Alcohol may cause sideropenic and megaloblastic anemia. There are two forms of alcohol muscle injury: the acute one, with myonecrosis and inflammatory reaction, and chronic one, with muscle weakness and atrophy. Alcohol is one of etiologic factors of osteoporosis. An acute intoxication result in transitory hypoparatthyreoidism, while chronic ethanol intake make grow the PTH level and decreases the level of D vitamin metabolises. Stimulation of cortisol secretion, decrease of testosterone level and a reversible decrease of T3 and T4 levels have been described following ethanol administration. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suffers alteration in alcoholics, and secondary amenorrhea is observed in female alcoholics. Ethanol behaves as an agonist on GABA receptor. Fetal alcohol syndrome together with Down's syndrome and spina bifida are the most frequent reasons of mental retardation in developed countries. Toxicity of ethanol affects the whole pregnancy period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Teratogenesis of alcohol
A1  - Spagnolo A.
Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Many studies describing the teratogenic effects of alcohol have been published since Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first identified in 1973. Specifically, it has been a widely documented that alcohol is a teratogen that causes brain, craniofacial, and limb abnormalities in children suffering from FAS. These children have also been shown to be at high risk for mental deficiencies. Teratogenicity has only been observed in offspring of mothers who consume large quantities of alcohol during pregnancy, while the effects of moderate drinking, though linked with adverse fetal alcohol effects in many reports, are not yet clear. Studies have also shown that teratogenic effects of paternal drinking on newborns. Estimates of prevalence at birth of FAS range from 1.9 to 0.33 per 1,000 births, depending on race, population, socioeconomic status, etc. New hypotheses on the biochemical basis of ethanol-induced birth defects have been recently proposed, contributing to the understanding of alcohol teratogenicity. The following review focuses on major recent findings in this field and describes the current situation regarding FAS.

N2  - Visual impairment is one of the most common ophthalmic abnormalities in fetal alcohol syndrome. Pathologic changes in optic nerve development related to alcohol consumption could be involved in this dysfunction. In order to assess the consequences of pre- and postnatal exposure to alcohol on the developing optic nerve, we administered an ethanol-containing liquid diet (5% w/v) before and during gestation and throughout lactation to rats and their offspring. A group of control animals were kept on a pair-fed isocaloric diet. The optic nerves were obtained at key stages from fetuses (21 days of gestation) and pups (4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 postnatal days). Samples of the optic nerve cross-section, behind the eyeball, were processed for analysis of gliogenesis, myelinogenesis, axonal growth, and remodelling events, using light and electron microscopy. Qualitative, morphometric, and immunocytochemical analyses, alternatively using anti-GFAP and anti-MBP antibodies, were carried out. Optic nerve cross-sections from prenatal and postnatal alcohol-exposed rats showed a decrease in size. Ultrastructural alterations and retarded development in macroglial cells, optic axons, and myelin sheath were also observed. The most prominent abnormalities were: damage of cytoplasmic organelles and disorganization of cytoskeleton in astrocytes; a decrease in free ribosome density and nuclear membrane inclusions in oligodendrocytes; and fragmentation of lamellae, aberrant myelin sheaths and intralamellar inclusions in myelin. These findings suggest that alcohol abuse during pregnancy is teratogenic to the optic nerve and closely related to the altered visual function.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - There has been concern since antiquity that the ingestion of alcohol by the pregnant woman could damage the fetus, but it was not until 1973 that the fetal alcohol syndrome was first described. The broad effect of alcohol- related birth defects, including fetal alcohol effects (FAE), has become apparent even more recently. Physicians can play a central role in the prevention of alcohol-related birth defects through early detection, education of the mother, and appropriate referrals. This paper reviews the effects of maternal alcohol use on the fetus, discusses the importance of assessing alcohol use among all women of child bearing age, and examines intervention strategies that physicians can use to help pregnant women stop or reduce alcohol use. Funding for this paper was provided by the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to present a series of case reports of infants and young children who were exposed to alcohol prenatally. The five infants and two 5-year-old twins in this series all presented facial features characteristic of prenatal alcohol exposure, and all had medical histories of maternal alcohol abuse. The neuromotor and cognitive development of these seven children is described by presenting results of standardized tests administered longitudinally. In addition, clinical observations of growth, behavior, feeding, and musculoskeletal development are provided. Following a discussion of these assessment results, implications for physical therapy intervention and the need for clinical research are provided. Because children with fetal alcohol syndrome or alcohol-related birth defects present a spectrum of developmental differences that often include areas of concern to physical therapists, we need to increase our involvement in the assessment and treatment of these children as well as in research efforts to examine the efficacy of these interventions.

T1  - Ethanol alters hormone production in cultured human placental trophoblasts

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can lead to abnormalities in fetal development, including the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Although intrauterine growth retardation is a hallmark of FAS, the pathophysiology is not fully understood. A contributing factor may be altered placental function, which could affect fetal growth and development. As a major endocrine organ during pregnancy, changes in the production of placental hormones could affect pregnancy and possibly fetal development. In this study, the effect of continued exposure to ethanol on placental hormone production was examined using cultured human placental trophoblasts. Ethanol exposure involved diffusion of ethanol from the atmosphere into the culture medium. This was refreshed daily, leading to daily peak concentrations of 280 to 300 mg/dl (60-65 mM) at 16 to 24 hr. This ethanol exposure for 2 or 4 days significantly increased the production of human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone by the cultured trophoblasts. However, ethanol treatment had no effect on human placental lactogen production. Acute stimulation (10 min) of cultured trophoblasts with adenosine (50 muM) normally results in increased production of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). With ethanol exposure, adenosine-stimulated cAMP production was significantly elevated relative to that in controls. However, the effect of ethanol on adenosine- stimulated cAMP did not appear to be secondary to chronic alterations in adenosine in the culture medium. Measurement of adenosine in the culture medium revealed no difference in concentration or production between control and ethanol treated groups. Moreover, chronic (24 hr) pretreatment of trophoblasts with 0.2 to 10 muM additional adenosine before acute adenosine stimulation did not alter the cAMP response in either control or ethanol- treated cells. This study demonstrates that ethanol exposure may alter placental production of hormones, specifically those that are cAMP dependent.

N2  - Exposure to ethanol in utero compromises the offspring's developing immune and endocrine systems. Persistent functional changes, particularly in T- cell-dependent aspects of immunity and in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity, are commonly seen. The present study examined the degree to which fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) during development suppressed the lymphocyte proliferative response to Concanavalin-A (Con A). We also examined the effect of maternal adrenalectomy on the expression of glucocorticoid-regulated genes and the response to Con A in FAE offspring. Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was stably suppressed (between 28-46%) in FAE males compared to isocalorically pair-fed offspring at 7, 21, 40, and 60 days of age. In contrast, lymphocyte proliferation in the immature or peripubertal FAE female was totally unaffected. In 60-day- old male rats, maternal adrenalectomy reversed the FAE-induced suppression of Con A-stimulated proliferation, but had no effect on lymphocyte proliferation. FAE increased anterior pituitary POMC (the precursor of ACTH) mRNA levels dramatically in males, and this increase was also reversed by maternal adrenalectomy. In both sexes, anterior pituitary glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels were unaffected by prenatal alcohol exposure alone, but were significantly decreased in male and increased in female offspring of adrenalectomized dams ingesting alcohol. Furthermore, in male, but not female, offspring, hypothalamic levels of glucocorticoid receptor and CRF mRNA were increased significantly by FAE alone or in combination with maternal adrenalectomy. In female, but not male, offspring, maternal adrenalectomy with concomitant alcohol exposure increased anterior pituitary POMC mRNA levels compared to that in sham/pair-fed offspring. In summary, FAE induced a gender-specific impairment of Con A- stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. This deficit is present both before and after puberty, demonstrating its stability into adulthood. Furthermore, in males, maternal adrenalectomy reversed these FAE-induced deficits in T-cell function as well as the effect of FAE on anterior pituitary POMC expression. This supports the hypothesis that maternal adrenal hormones participate in the immunosuppressive 'imprinting' of the FAE fetus and are, therefore, causally implicated in the sexually dimorphic T-cell dysfunction found in FAE offspring.

N2  - The hypothesis was tested that prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts developmental homeostasis, as reflected in increased dermatoglyphic fluctuating asymmetry. Twenty-two patients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 9 with fetal alcohol effect (FAE) were matched for sex with 31 controls. On each patient, the right a-b dermal ridge count was subtracted from the left to obtain the asymmetry value. Group differences were tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA), and paired two-tailed t tests. Mean asymmetry increased from control (1.94) through FAE (2.78) to the FAS (4.00) group. Group differences were significant by ANOVA (p = 0.0066); only the FAS and control group differed by t test (p = 0.0025). The results support the hypothesis of increased decanalization of prenatal development in the presence of alcohol.

N2  - Maternal ethanol consumption has deleterious effects on the offspring's neuroendocrine and T-cell-dependent functions. Chronic alcohol consumption in adulthood has also been associated with activated hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) function and immunosuppression which is demonstrable at the T- cell level. Our aim was to establish whether prenatal alcohol exposure alters the neuroendocrine and immune responses to chronic alcohol challenge in adult male and female offspring. Adult male rats placed on a liquid alcohol diet for 5 weeks had significantly decreased thymus weight, hypertrophied adrenals, and elevated plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels. Splenic lymphocyte Concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated proliferation in the ethanol- treated rats was decreased compared to that in pair-fed controls. Thus, prolonged alcohol exposure activated the HPA axis and suppressed T-cell function. The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, as a predispositional factor, on the HPA axis and on the T-cell functions of adult chronic alcohol- exposed rats were examined in the offspring of dams fed ethanol (FAE) or an isocaloric liquid (PF) diet during the last 2 weeks of gestation. The adult offspring of both sexes and prenatal treatment groups were then placed on an alcohol-containing liquid diet for 5 weeks. Fetal alcohol exposure decreased anterior pituitary proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels and increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA levels in males and decreased GR mRNA levels in females. There were no differences in hypothalamic CRF mRNA and GR mRNA levels between the prenatal treatment groups. There was no significant difference in Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation between FAE and PF males. However, FAE females showed Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation significantly higher than those of all other groups, including pair-fed females. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) suppressed lymphocyte proliferation to a lesser degree in FAE males than in any other group. Furthermore, T-cell response to Con A was enhanced by indomethacin, a prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibitor, in FAE males suggesting that increased prostaglandin synthesis may occur in FAE males after chronic alcohol exposure. Increased levels of endogenous PGE2 could also be inferred from the enhanced levels of interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha) mRNA in activated lymphocytes of male but not of female FAE offspring compared to PF. In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure leads to a specific HPA- related vulnerability in males to the deleterious effects of ethanol in adulthood. Although prenatal alcohol did not further aggravate the effects of chronic alcohol exposure on lymphocyte proliferation response to Con A in adult male offspring, altered T-cell responses could be unmasked.

N2  - Three of four siblings born to parents with a history of heavy alcohol abuse had bilateral diffusely cloudy corneas at birth. These three siblings, who had mild systemic features of fetal alcohol syndrome, underwent corneal transplantations, and their specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy. Histologically, the alterations in Bowman's layer ranged from thickening to total loss. There were varying degrees of corneal stromal edema. The unique pathologic feature in the corneas was the anomaly of the anterior banded zone of Descemet's membrane, which was either absent, poorly formed, or thinned in the central and peripheral cornea. The corneal endothelium was attenuated or multilayered. The diffuse clouding and the range of histologic abnormalities in the corneas might be related to the maternal alcohol abuse.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a leading cause of congenital mental retardation but little is known about the long-term development and adolescent outcome of children with FAS. In a 10-year follow-up study of 60 patients diagnosed as having FAS in infancy and childhood, we investigated the long-term sequelae of intrauterine alcohol exposure. We found that the characteristic craniofacial malformations of FAS diminish with time, but microcephaly and, to a lesser degree, short stature and underweight (in boys) persist; in female adolescents body weight normalises. Persistent mental retardation is the major sequela of intrauterine alcohol exposure in many cases, and environmental and educational factors do not have strong compensatory effects on the intellectual development of affected children.

N2  - Results of previous studies of effects of drinking during pregnancy on standardized tests of infant development have varied, depending on level of exposure. This study of 382 Black, inner city infants confirmed effects of moderate-to-heavy prenatal alcohol exposure on Bayley Scale performance originally observed in a White, middle class cohort. Effects of second and third trimester drinking were as strong or stronger than those of drinking at the time of conception. New methods for reducing the Bayley Scale data suggested specific deficits relating to emergence of the ability to imitate modeled behavior and the development of standing and walking. The incidence of very poor performance (bottom 10th percentile) on the Bayley Mental Development Index more than doubled in children whose mothers averaged at least 0.5 oz absolute alcohol per day during pregnancy, indicating that this exposure has a clinically meaningful impact at markedly lower levels than those associated with full fetal alcohol syndrome. Clinically meaningful effects on the Psychomotor Development Index, by contrast, were seen only in the infants of heavy drinking mothers with overt symptomatology of alcohol abuse. Adverse effects on Bayley Scale performance were more prevalent in the infants of women more than 30 years of age.

Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes malformations of the eyes with serious consequences to the vision of the affected children. A high percentage (up to 90 per cent) of children suffering from the fetal alcohol syndrome have eye abnormalities of different kinds. The most typical are hypoplasia of the optic nervehead and increased tortuosity of the retinal vessels, especially of the arteries, both occurring in up to half of the cases. Visual acuity is often reduced. Considering the developmental timing of different tissues of the eye, one can presume that there is a risk for deleterious effects of alcohol on eye structures at any point of time from early gestation until development is completed.

N2  - Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in 1973, significant inroads have been made towards understanding the effects of alcohol on fetal development. However, it is not clear if these findings are considered clinically relevant by pediatricians. This survey was designed to assess clinical knowledge, practice, and attitudes concerning alcohol-related birth defects. Data were collected in a questionnaire that was mailed to 234 randomly selected Massachusetts pediatricians. Responses suggest that a substantial proportion of pediatricians have knowledge about the effects of alcohol on pregnancy. However, many considered themselves unprepared to deal with this topic. More physicians suspected FAS/FAE than made the diagnosis. Almost three fourths reported they would find professional education in this area helpful. Broader dissemination of research findings in clinically relevant formats and improving the sense of preparedness among pediatricians have the potential to improve the care of children born to heavily drinking pregnant women.

T1  - Alcohol and narcotics: Epidemiology and pregnancy risks
A1  - Olegard R.
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Among alcohol and narcotics, alcohol is most comprehensively documented as a teratogen. However, for all other narcotics, data are continuously accumulating, convincingly displaying the teratogenic effects. The proportions between 'somatic' teratogenicity and 'behavioral' teratogenicity vary between the different agents. Preventive work in prenatal clinics and among social workers, as well as objective mass media attention to the problem, seems to have lowered the incidence of severe fetal alcohol syndrome where the above-mentioned activities have been practiced. The female alcohol consumption in Sweden decreased from 1976 to 1985; thereafter, a slow continuous increase is underway again. In Sweden the number of recruits to narcotic abuse peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s. Thereafter, the number of recruits among females decreased, but abuse has continued among the members of the older age groups.

N2  - The thymoproliferative response to concanavalin A (ConA) following fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) is higher than control (149%) on day 44, is lower than control (64%) by day 51, and normalizes by day 69 (88% of controls). The ontogeny of HLA-Dr and transferrin receptor (CD71) expression in response to anti-CD3 stimulation is similar among the groups, but is distinct from that of ConA proliferation. The ontogeny of glucocorticoid cytoplasmic receptor (GCCR) sites per thymocyte is also different from the ontogeny of the ConA response. The number of GCCR sites rises sharply (2.5-fold) in control rat thymocytes between days 30 and 44, and remains at that level at later time points. By contrast, the number of GCCR sites per FAE thymocytes rises nearly linearly and normalizes by day 72. Our data support the notion that prenatal alcohol exposure significantly alters thymic development and indicates that the relationship between the development of thymocyte functional responses and that of GCCR is more complex than initially hypothesized.

N2  - Adult rats exposed to prenatal alcohol were evaluated for their susceptibility to either hormone- or chemical-inducing tumors. In the first study, rats exposed to prenatal alcohol displayed an increased propensity to beta-estradiol (E2)-induced adenohypophyseal prolactinoma. The susceptibility was manifest as a potentiated increase in anterior pituitary weight as well as in serum prolactin levels after 1 and 3 weeks but not 5 weeks of hormone treatment. Two weeks after withdrawing the E2-implant, the prolactinoma underwent involution and serum prolactin reversed to baseline levels. The high concentrations of serum corticosterone were also reduced but did not return to baseline levels after E2 removal. In the second study, nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) was utilized to induce esophageal cancer in adult rats. There were no significant differences in tumor incidence or size between the prenatal alcohol-exposed and the pair-fed cohorts. However, the NMBA-treated prenatal alcohol-exposed rats displayed a marked decrease in thymus: body wt ratio as well as adrenal gland hyperplasia. The results suggest that no single mechanism can account for the variable susceptibility displayed by the prenatal alcohol-exposed rats to chemical carcinogens. Some of the observed changes, however, may be attributable to the long-lasting adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the well-being of the adult host.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a set of signs and symptoms in offsprings born to mothers who abuse alcohol during pregnancy. We postulated that impairment in the placental endocrine function contribute to FAS. In this study, we examined in vitro effects of ethanol on the placental cells' (cytotrophoblast cells) capacity to synthesize progesterone. Cytotrophoblast cells were isolated from normal term placenta and were incubated (2 x 106) with 20-, 30-, and 40-mM doses of ethanol for 6 h. Progesterone was measured in the incubate by RIA. The results showed that, at the 20-mM dose of ethanol, progesterone synthesis was significantly decreased (p < 0.01), at the 30-mM dose level there was a further decrease of 20%. The differences between 30- and 40-mM ethanol dose levels were not significant. To determine the mechanism of ethanol effects on progesterone synthesis, cytotrophoblast cells were preincubated with 30 mM ethanol followed by 10 mul of LDL (10 mul LDL = 80 mug cholesterol) and vice versa. The results showed that ethanol effects on progesterone synthesis was dependent on whether ethanol was added prior to or following the addition of LDL in the medium. If ethanol was added in the medium prior to LDL, progesterone synthesis was decreased significantly (p > 0.01); however, when ethanol was added after the LDL, ethanol had no effect on progesterone synthesis. In the experiment where ethanol and LDL were added simultaneously in the medium, ethanol blunted the stimulatory effect of LDL on progesterone synthesis. To determine whether ethanol affects steroid-producing enzymes localized in the cell organelles mitochondria and microsome were isolated and incubated together with LDL (5 mul LDL = 40 mug cholesterol) in the presence of 30 or 40 mM ethanol. Progesterone was isolated, quantitated, and the results showed that ethanol had no affect on progesterone synthesis suggesting that capacity of steroid- producing enzymes was not affected in the presence of ethanol. From these data, we conclude that ethanol decreased progesterone synthesis in the cytotrophoblast cells, and decrease is caused by blocking of substrate (cholesterol) entry into cell organelles.

Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Maternal alcoholism can lead to the fetal alcohol syndrome in offspring, but the effect of more moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy remains an issue of concern. Therefore, we analyzed data from a large case-control study of spontaneous abortion (626 cases, 1,300 controls) that ascertained maternal alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy, as well as paternal consumption. Asking when in pregnancy alcohol consumption changed allowed us to calculate a weighted average of the amount consumed weekly during the first trimester. The odds ratio for consumption of seven or more drinks per week was 1.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-3.4] when adjusted for maternal smoking, passive smoking, and maternal age. Data were too sparse to examine higher consumption levels. There was some evidence that cases may have had less opportunity than controls to decrease consumption during their shorter pregnancies, potentially biasing the odds ratio upward. The adjusted odds ratio for any paternal alcohol consumption was 1.2 (CI = 0.93-1.5), with no dose-response effect seen. Among pregnancies in which the mother did not drink, there was no association with paternal drinking.

Y1  - 1992//
N2  - This paper reports on six children who all fulfill the criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome and have a history of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy, and who also fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of autism. Their behavior and natural history is compared with eight contrast FAS children, of similar ages and functional levels, who were free of autistic behaviors. The autistic FAS children were all moderately or severely retarded. Autistic behavior has not been commonly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinicians need to be aware of this potential dual diagnosis so that appropriate educational and treatment resources can be employed.

N2  - The frequencies of 60 minor physical anomalies and various craniofacial measurements in 52 children with alcohol exposure of various durations in utero were determined and compared with 48 non-exposed healthy children at a mean age of 27 months. Compared with nonexposed children a significantly higher total minor physical anomaly count was observed in those children exposed prenatally to alcohol throughout pregnancy. Binge drinking was not associated with an increased minor physical anomaly count. During the first year of life facial features were judged according to subjective impression: 10 children had typical facial features of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 19 children were judged to have possible fetal alcohol effects on their face. Only six of them fulfilled the strict craniofacial criteria for diagnosis of FAS at the age of 27 months. Our results stress the importance of recognising also the subtle dysmorphic facial features associated with prenatal alcohol exposure: 22 of 29 (76%) of exposed children judged to have typical or possible features of FAS during the first year showed signs of central nervous system dysfunction at the age of 27 months.

N2  - Alcohol is the most frequent and most important teratogenic agent causing mental and physical retardation in childhood. The alcohol fetal syndrome is characterized by pre- and postnatal growth retardation, hypotonia, hyperactivity, microcephalus, mental retardation and typical craniofacial malformations. The latter includes short palpebral fissures, a poorly developed philtrum, thin upper lip vermillion, short mandibles, a flattened midface structure and dysplastic ears. Ophthalmological signs occur in 90% and include epicanthus, ptosis, myopia, optic nerve hypoplasia and tortuous retinal vessels. Microphthalmus, coloboma and Peters' anomaly have also been described. Five children with alcohol embryopathy are presented. The histopathological findings of the enucleated eye of a 6th child with alcohol embryopathy which was sent to us for examination and which revealed an anterior staphyloma with Peters' anomaly is also described. Ophthalmologists should be aware of alcohol in pregnancy as a preventable cause of eye malformation.

N2  - In a prospective study intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (<10. growth percentile at birth) was used as a predictor to diagnose intrauterine alcohol exposure. An interview about maternal alcohol consumption was performed prenatally - when IUGR was diagnosed by ultrasound - or postnatally. The children were followed up to 18 months of age. In 6/47 children we diagnosed various degrees of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome FAS, with only one patient showing a full blown syndrome at birth. 5 patients could not be identified until the pediatric reexamination at the age of 8-18 months. IUGR and a maternal history of even moderate drinking during pregnancy should emphasize the possibility of an intrauterine alcohol damage, even in a normal child at birth.

N2  - Recognition of alcohol-related birth defects is less successful in the neonate than in older children. Clarren et al. (1987) were able to describe the geometry of the FAS face at age 7. To define neonatal facial features of FAS, 3 reference points were used to map 7 frontal and 7 profile landmarks coded as standardized cartesian coordinates. These landmarks were digitized from snapshots of 21 neonates, prospectively diagnosed as FAS blinded for prenatal alcohol exposure, and 76 non-FAS controls. In the controls, race was found to be a significant determinant of landmarks, as expected. Using discriminant analysis and controlling for race, the FAS face was characterized by landmark measurements which correspond to short palpebral fissure, scooping out of the nasal bridge and thin vermilion [F(4,71)-7.8, r sq-30%, p < .01]. Jackknifed sensitivity was 75%, specificity, 79%. These findings suggest that FAS-defining features can be quantified in the neonate via computer-based screening of infants from at-risk pregnancies.

T1  - The effects of maternal drinking in the reproductive period: an epidemiologic review
A1  - Little R.E.

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - The major effects of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy are decreased fetal growth, morphologic abnormalities, and CNS impairment. If all three of these are present, with a characteristic facies in the infant, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is diagnosed. FAS occurs only with heavy or alcoholic drinking. The individual components of the syndrome exhibit a dose-response association with ethanol intake in many, but not all studies. Discrepancies in maternal drinking and pregnancy outcome reflect the myriad difficulties of these investigations. Drinking "before" pregnancy also has been linked to decrements in fetal development, possibly because before pregnancy may include the periconceptional period. However, women who are usually abstainers before pregnancy appear to have infants at higher risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes than women who are light drinkers. Future studies need to construct careful drinking histories to address this and other questions that deal with parents' ethanol use and reproductive health.

N2  - The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth, dysmorphology, and cognitive development at 6 years was examined in children whose mothers had completed a self-administered questionnaire during pregnancy. Drinking patterns prior to pregnancy recognition and indications of problem drinking (IPD) were assessed. Heavier alcohol intake was associated with slower growth in height and head circumference and increased dysmorphology, as evidenced by facial features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and the prevalence of probable/possible fetal alcohol effects (FAE). Indications of problem drinking predicted facial features associated with FAS and cognitive deficits (i.e., lower WPPSI Verbal IQ scores and lower scores on a test of receptive language function, the Token Test). Effects of alcohol consumption on head circumference and of indications of problem drinking on Verbal IQ and Token Test scores remained significant, even after excluding children born to mothers having drinkers (over seven drinks a day) and children with probable/possible FAE. Verbal IQ was an average of 7.1 points (95% confidence interval = 0.01, 14.25) lower among children born to mothers having more than one indication of problem drinking than it was among those born to women having fewer indications; Token Test scores were 4.3 points lower (95% confidence interval = 1.38, 7.24). Although the confidence intervals for these estimates are broad in this small, heterogeneous sample, their magnitude, if confirmed, is significant given that the population standard deviation for Verbal IQ is 15, and that for the Token Test is 5.

N2  - This report examines the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on size and growth in an urban cohort followed prospectively through early childhood. Indices of prenatal drinking were related to measurements of weight, stature (length), and head circumference obtained at birth and during five subsequent in-home assessments. Small but statistically significant relationships were detected between short-term recall estimates of drinking during pregnancy and weight and length at birth. The strength of these relationships diminished during the preschool assessments. However, estimates of catch-up growth associated with alcohol exposure were not statistically significant. With the exception of a single case with a profile of signs characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome, an adverse effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on head circumference was not indicated.

T1  - The effects of chronic postweaning amphetamine on rats exposed to alcohol in utero: Weight gain and behavior
A1  - Hannigan J.H.
A1  - Pilati M.L.
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Offspring of rats fed alcohol, pair-fed, or fed ad lib control diets during pregnancy were administered a dose of amphetamine (0, 2 or 10 mg/kg) daily from postnatal day 22 (PN22) to PN42. Body weight was measured regularly from PN22 to PN60, and behavior was measured on PN22, PN28, PN36 and PN42. Rats exposed to alcohol in utero weighed less than controls at birth and throughout most of the experiment, despite a significantly accelerated weight gain relative to controls. By PN60, prenatal alcohol-exposed rats weighed the same as pair-fed controls. There were dose-dependent reductions in the rate of weight gain during amphetamine administration. After the daily injections stopped, the high-dose (10-mg/kg) amphetamine groups showed a higher growth rate than the 0-mg/kg and 2-mg/kg groups. There were no interactions between prenatal treatment and dose of amphetamine on body weight gain. Rats exposed to alcohol in utero showed a greater locomotor activation than controls given 2 mg/kg amphetamine. The magnitude of the locomotor activation to this dose of amphetamine decreased equivalently over the four test days for all prenatal treatment groups. Male but not female rats exposed prenatally to alcohol showed an apparent sensitization to 10 mg/kg amphetamine not seen in control rats between PN28 and PN42. There were no group differences in amphetamine-induced stereotypy or SGH-23390-induced catalepsy. The results implied that children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome who may be treated for attentional dysfunction would show different dose-responses for some behavioral effects of CNS stimulants, but not for growth-retarding 'side effects.'

N2  - A hospital based, comprehensive approach to the prevention of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects that combines clinical assessment, community outreach, and epidemiologic knowledge to attack alcohol-related birth defects is described. The program includes training of clinicians and members of the community, baseline screening of suspected children, and alcohol consumption screening of pregnant women in prenatal clinics. The major, although not exclusive, focus of the program is on tertiary prevention undertaken with women defined as 'high risk' for producing alcohol affected children. Of the 48 women referred to the program at the Tuba City, AZ, Indian Medical Center between January 1988 and July 1989, 39 (81 percent) became participants. Complete followup was possible on 31; 17 of them reported alcohol abstinence in July 1989, 18 months into the program. Of the 29 referred women who were pregnant at the time, 21 agreed to participate; of these, 19 (85.7 percent) were abstinent by the third trimester of pregnancy; 5 voluntarily accepted offers of contraceptive measures after the birth of their child.

N2  - Spraque-Dawley rats were exposed to ethyl alcohol in utero. The effect of chronic prenatal exposure was examined by giving mature females alcohol in isocaloric liquid diets which served as the sole source of liquid and caloric intake before mating and throughout gestation. Controls consisted of females maintained on laboratory chow or an isocaloric liquid diet minus alcohol before and during gestation. The offspring were sacrificed at 21 days of age (weanlings) and the hearts dissociated enzymatically to give purified cardiac myocytes. The effects of daily acute prenatal alcohol exposure were studied by gastric intubation of alcohol to chow-fed females for the duration of pregnancy. The doses used approximated 4 and 5 shots of 80 proof liquor per day by a person weighing 150 lb. These offspring were sacrificed at 2, 6, and 21 days postnatal and cardiac myocytes prepared as above. Heart weights were determined and cardiac myocytes were analyzed for cell length, volume, cross-sectional area, and percent binucleation. Additionally, nuclear DNA content was measured in all of the 21 day offspring. Statistical analysis of the data showed no significant differences between hearts exposed to prenatal alcohol and nonexposed controls with either regimen with the exception of percent binucleation which was significantly but only slightly higher in the 6-day-old hearts. These findings are discussed in relation to anatomical heart defects found in patients with full fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Alcohol, a potential teratogen, has been suggested as an etiologic agent in attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD), which is often diagnosed in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and in children of alcoholics. We studied attentional and behavioral factors associated with diagnosis of this disorder in children selected from a predominantly low-income, black population who were tested as part of a longitudinal follow-up of children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Sixty-eight children with a mean age of 5 years 10 months, born to three groups of mothers, were assessed. These groups consisted of: a) women who reported not drinking during pregnancy (n = 21), b) women who reported drinking throughout pregnancy (n = 25), and c) women who reported drinking an equivalent amount but who stopped drinking after educational intervention during the second trimester (n = 22). Dimensions assessed included factors related to attention on a computerized task, impulsivity, and the presence of psychiatrically significant internalizing and externalizing behaviors. In addition, free play and mother-child interactions were video-taped, and evidence of overactive and noncompliant behaviors was noted. Hyperactivity and impulsive behavior were not evident. Results indicated that children exposed throughout pregnancy showed deficits in the ability to sustain attention and were more often described by teachers, although not by their mothers, as showing attentional and behavioral problems. Problems in both internalizing and externalizing behaviors also were noted by teachers. However, when current drinking was controlled, only externalizing behaviors remained different by group. Noting the limitations of the present study, implications of these findings are discussed. These include identification of symptoms of ADHD in children of women who abuse alcohol as well as qualitative differences from clinically identified ADHD children.

N2  - Alcohol is a potent teratogen associated with dysmorphology, growth retardation, and neurological damage in children with the full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS); alcohol is also associated with growth retardation and behavioral alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to various dosages. Questions remain about the long-term consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. This study reports on the follow-up of a subsample of 68 children, the majority of whom were low income and black (mean age: 5 years, 10 months) who were first evaluated as neonates. Physical and cognitive outcomes of 25 children of women who drank throughout pregnancy [absolute alcohol (AA)/week: mean = 11.80 oz), even after receiving an educational intervention to stop drinking, were compared with outcomes of children in two contrast groups: a) women (n = 22) who stopped drinking (AA/week: mean = 11.46 oz) in the second trimester after an educational intervention but resumed postpartum; and b) women who did not drink during pregnancy and who drank little postnatally (n = 21). Children were compared for alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), growth (height, weight, and head circumference), and cognitive, academic, and adaptive measures. Neonatal and current physical measures were correlated to determine predictability of neonatal status. When the effects of age and gender were controlled, children in the continued-to-drink group showed significantly more ARBDs and had smaller head circumferences than those in the other two groups. When current drinking reported by caretakers was controlled, the children who were exposed throughout pregnancy also showed significant and consistent deficits in several areas of intellectual functioning including sequential processing (short-term memory and encoding) and overall mental processing. Alcohol-exposed children displayed significant deficits in preacademic skills when compared with children of nondrinkers, with both alcohol groups deficient in premath and reading skills. There were no differences in adaptive behavior at follow-up. These data suggest that alcohol exposure throughout pregnancy is correlated with persistent physical differences as well as identifiable deficits in sequential memory processes and specific academic skills. However, even when alcohol use is limited to the first part of pregnancy, significant deficits in academic skills and growth parameters are measurable.

T1  - Effects of alcohol (ethanol) on the fetus
A1  - Brien J.F.
A1  - Smith G.N.
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Alcohol (ethanol) use during pregnancy can produce a wide spectrum of effects in the developing embryo/fetus that are dependent on the maternal drinking pattern. The effects of chronic ethanol exposure on the developing conceptus are reviewed with primary focus on ethanol teratogenesis, manifesting in the human as the fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects. The effects of acute ethanol exposure on the near-term fetus are described, including suppressed fetal breathing movements, electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity and electrooculographic (EOG) activity. The ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is a very sensitive index of acute exposure of the near-term fetus to ethanol, and appears to involve a direct mechanism of action rather than an indirect mechanism involving suppression of electrocortical activity. This disposition of ethanol and its pharmacologically active proximate metabolite, acetaldehyde, and the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase in the near-term maternal-fetal unit are described, and a pharmacokinetic model is proposed. The effects of short-term ethanol exposure on the near-term fetus include the development of tolerance to the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements, low-voltage ECoG activity and EOG activity. The development of tolerance occurs more rapidly to the latter two fetal biophysical activities. The mechanism of tolerance development appears to be pharmacodynamic (functional) in nature, as there is no increase in the rate of ethanol elimination from the maternal-fetal unit. The role of prostaglandins (PGs) in the mechanism of the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is described. In the near-term fetus, there is a direct relationship between fetal blood ethanol concentration and fetal plasma PGE2 concentration, and an inverse relationship between the incidence of fetal breathing movements and each of fetal plasma and fetal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PGE2 concentrations. Indomethacin, a PG synthetase inhibitor, selectively blocks and reverses the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements. These data support the postulates that the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is mediated by increased PGE2 concentration in the near-term fetus and that the ability of indomethacin to antagonize the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is due to its biochemical action to decrease fetal PGE2 concentration. Current and future research activities are directed towards determining whether the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is due to increased PGE2 concentration in the lower brain stem (lower pons/medulla) of the near-term fetus resulting either from increased local synthesis of PGE2 or from increased PGE2 synthesis at a site(s) outside the central nervous system and consequent transfer of PGE2 from the fetal systemic circulation into the lower brain stem.

T1  - Can methionine and zinc prevent the embryopathic effects of alcohol?
A1  - Seyoum G.G.

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Alcoholism is a major and world-wide health problem. A characteristic pattern of congenital defects, known as the fetal alcohol syndrome, has been detected in the offspring of mothers who are chronic alcoholics .The mechanism underlying the teratogenic effects of ethanol is not known. An important hypothesis is that ethanol becomes teratogenic by inducing maternal/fetal nutritional deficiencies. Nutrients affected by ethanol consumption include methionine and zinc. Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that zinc deficiency is associated with both fetal growth retardation and developmental defects. Furthermore, the ethanol metabolizing enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, is a zinc metalloenzyme. Zinc deficiency decreases alcohol dehydrogenase activity and thus slows down elimination of ethanol. Methionine, an essential amino acid, is a lipotrope, as well as a universal methyl donor. It is involved in hepatic detoxification. Studies on the effects of methionine and zinc might lead to appropriate therapeutic intervention in pregnancies of alcoholic mothers who are at a risk of giving birth to an impaired offspring. Furthermore, the results of such investigations will provide a better understanding of the mechanism of action of ethanol on the embryo.

T1  - Spatial learning of adult rats with fetal alcohol exposure: deficits are sex-dependent
A1  - Zimmerberg B.
A1  - Sukel H.L.
A1  - Stekler J.D.
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on learning in adult offspring were studied in a spatial task in a T-maze. Male and female Long-Evans rats were selected from litters whose dams had received one of three treatments: alcohol in a liquid diet (35% ethanol-derived calories, 35% EDC), pair-fed nutritional control (0% ethanol-derived calories, 0% EDC) or standard control (lab chow, LC). The task included trial-independent (reference memory) and trial-dependent (working memory) components: subjects were required to make a fixed left-right discrimination, and then to alternate left and right choices to escape water. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with a greater number of reference errors for both sexes; only males from the alcohol prenatal treatment group, however, were impaired on the working memory component. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol can cause behavioral dysfunctions that persist into adulthood. Secondly, the pattern of memory impairments suggests that both sexes may be equivalently damaged in neural areas subserving reference memory, but that males are selectively more vulnerable in neural areas subserving working memory.

N2  - The teratogenic effects of drinking during pregnancy on cognitive development were investigated in a cohort of disadvantaged mother-infant pairs. Three indices associated with maternal alcohol use were related to comprehensive cognitive measures obtained during five in-home assessments through age four years, ten months. Birth weight and a tally of craniofacial anomalies were also evaluated as early indicators of fetal alcohol damage. Multiple analyses relating the alcohol and cognitive measures provided no evidence of an adverse alcohol effect on cognitive development in the absence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Assessments based on confidence intervals indicated that an average decrement of more than two points (IQ equivalent) on the five cognitive measures is unlikely for relatively heavy levels of maternal alcohol use or alcohol-related problems. Marginal relationships were observed between cognitive measures and the neonatal indicators, but depended heavily on the influence of a child exhibiting signs consistent with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. This case therefore received special attention. The implications of the relationships involving the neonatal indicators were investigated using arguments based on path analysis.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a disorder that occurs in children of alcoholic mothers and is characterized by typical craniofacial dysmorphia and retardation of mental and physical growth. Semiquantitative evaluation of the most common symptoms permits clinical classification into three stages. Although numerous hypotheses have been suggested, the pathogenetic mechanism is not yet well understood. Prevention through medical advice and counselling still remains the most successful form of therapy. A case of fetal alcohol syndrome caused by excessive maternal drinking accompanied by high nicotine consumption during pregnancy is reported.

T1  - Alcohol and pregnancy. An epidemiologic perspective
A1  - Janerich D.T.
A1  - Taylor Mayne S.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - This article considers maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy, from an epidemiologic perspective. In general, maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy has been associated with a number of effects in offspring including fetal alcohol syndrome, a reduction in birth weight, effects on behavior, and other late effects. It is apparent from the existing literature that the epidemiologic dimensions of these effects are poorly defined and hampered by methodologic problems. Assessment of both outcome and exposure can be difficult, and there is great potential for uncontrolled confounding. Additionally, it is unclear whether the apparent teratogenicity of alcohol results from direct, acute effects of alcohol on the developing fetus, or results from chronic effects of excessive alcohol intake in the mother. This article concludes with recommendations for further research, which may help clarify the complexity of effects associated with maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy.

N2  - The effects of fetal alcohol exposure on language and speech acquisition were investigated in a cohort of socioeconomically disadvantaged urban children. Language development was assessed by instruments derived from the Expressive and Receptive Scales of the Sequenced Inventory of Communication Development (SICD) at 1, 2, and 3 years, and by indices constructed from a taped speech sample at age 2 years. Three indices of maternal drinking were supplemented with birth weight and a tally of craniofacial anomalies as early indicators of fetal alcohol damage. No statistically significant relationships were found between the alcohol and language indices after statistical control for confounding variables. The anomalies tally was marginally related to reduced language scores. The statistical significance of this relationship, depended, however, on a single child with the characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome. The pattern of results suggested that the anomalies tally, and to a lesser extent birth weight, are more sensitive indicators of fetal alcohol exposure than subsequent language development.

T1  - The role of acetate in alcohol-induced alterations of uterine glucose metabolism in the mouse during pregnancy
A1  - Simm B.
A1  - Murdoch R.N.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - The acute exposure of mice to ethanol during post-implantation pregnancy has been reported to cause alterations in the levels of several glycolytic intermediates in the uterus, suggesting a possible indirect mechanism of alcohol embryo-toxicity. The present study was undertaken to assess whether the ethanol metabolite, acetate is implicated in this phenomenon. Blood and uterine alcohol concentrations in day 9 - pregnant Quackenbush Swiss mice were maximal 15 minutes after the intraperitoneal injection of ethanol (3.5 g/kg body weight), and fell to almost negligible levels 6 hours later. In response to this treatment, the levels of blood and uterine acetate increased, liver glycogen decreased, plasma glucose increased, and uterine glucose, glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P), fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P), and citrate increased. When acetate was administered to pregnant mice in amounts approximating those generated by exposure to alcohol, the levels of uterine F-6-P and citrate increased while other metabolic parameters remained unaffected. The administration of 4-methylpyrazole to mice subsequently treated with alcohol produced conditions of alcohol exposure in the absence of ethanol-derived acetate and depressed the ethanol-induced rise in uterine G-6-P and citrate. The results support the notion that acetate contributes to the alcohol-induced alterations in metabolism, at least as far as the regulation of uterine citrate and hexose monophosphates are concerned. This, together with stress responses induced by exposure to the acute dose of alcohol, may present mechanisms underlying the fetal alcohol syndrome associated in particular with 'binge' drinking.

A1  - Gottesfeld Z.

A1  - Perez-Polo J.R.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol in utero has been associated with long-term immune deficits. In addition, adult mice exposed to alcohol prenatally display altered noradrenergic synaptic transmission selectively in lymphoid organs. This is consistent with the hypothesis that sympathetic neurons play an important role in immunomodulation. The development and maintenance of sympathetic neurons are critically dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF). Furthermore, NGF has been shown to modulate immune responses and NGF receptor expression has been localized to lymphoid organs. The present work examined the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the development and maturation of pre- and postsynaptic sympathetic components, including norepinephrine and beta-adrenoceptors, respectively, as well as the early expression of NGF receptors in lymphoid and other organs of the C57BL/6 mouse. Infant mice that were exposed to alcohol in utero displayed reduced levels of norepinephrine and beta-adrenoceptor density, as well as increased NGF receptor expression in the thymus and spleen, but not the heart. These selective changes may account, in part, for the persistent immune incompetence characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with derangements of reproductive function in women. The mechanism of increased risk for alcohol-related abortions and fetal alcohol syndrome is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine if acute alcohol administration affected gonadal steroid hormone levels after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to normal healthy women. hCG was used to simulate the hormonal milieu during the first trimester of pregnancy. Ten women were studied during the mid-luteal phase (between days 17 and 23) of their menstrual cycle. Plasma estradiol, progesterone and prolactin were measured before and after simultaneous administration of 5000 I.U. of hCG (Profasi) and alcohol or placebo solution under double-blind conditions. There was a significant increase in plasma estradiol (P < .001) and prolactin levels (P < .01) after hCG and alcohol administration but not after hCG and placebo administration. Plasma progesterone increased significantly (P < .001) above base line after hCG and placebo administration but this was not observed after hCG and alcohol administration. Since progesterone is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy, alcohol's attenuation of the expected progesterone response to hCG stimulation could increase the risk of spontaneous abortion. An alcohol-induced increase in estradiol after hCG administration could contribute to risk for fetal dysmorphology during the first trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a disorder that occurs in children of alcoholic mothers and is characterized by typical craniofacial dysmorphia and retardation of mental and physical growth. Semiquantitative evaluation of the most common symptoms permits clinical classification into three stages. Although numerous hypotheses have been suggested, the pathogenetic mechanism is not yet well understood. Prevention through medical advice and counselling still remains the most successful form of therapy. A case of fetal alcohol syndrome caused by excessive maternal drinking accompanied by high nicotine consumption during pregnancy is reported.

T1  - Lower serum thyroxine levels in rats following prenatal exposure to ethanol
A1  - Hannigan J.H.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is noted for poor growth, developmental delays, and mental retardation. In animals, prenatal alcohol exposure alters anatomical, physiological, and neurochemical maturation and produces behavioral changes similar to those in children. Since thyroid hormones are critical trophic factors for normal somatic and neural maturation, and since fetal thyroid hormones are profoundly affected by acute maternal ethanol administration, we hypothesized that postnatal effects of prenatal alcohol exposure may be related to abnormal thyroid hormone development. We report here that young rats exposed to alcohol in utero have significantly lower serum total thyroxine (T4) concentrations than normal and pair-fed control rats. The results suggest prenatal ethanol exposure may compromise thyroid development in ways not attributable to undernutrition or developmental delays alone. Lowered total T4 levels may be a teratogenic outcome of prenatal alcohol exposure, which could contribute to impaired growth, altered neural organization, and behavioral dysfunction.

N2  - The concentrations of triglyceride, cholesterol, phospholipids, and proteins in the major lipoprotein fractions (very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], and high-density lipoproteins [HDL] HDL2 and HDL3) were monitored in 20 pregnant women who chronically abused alcohol and in 15 abstinent pregnant women. Five of the alcohol users gave birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Lipoproteins were fractionated by sequential flotation from samples taken at 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 weeks of gestation and 6 to 8 weeks after delivery. In abstinent women, concentrations of VLDL and LDL triglyceride, cholesterol, phospholipids, and proteins increased in late gestation. Concentrations of HDL2-cholesterol, phospholipids, proteins, and total HDL2 were increased during the 16th to 28th weeks, but HDL3 remained unchanged. Alcohol abuse clearly reduced the normal increase in total and LDL-cholesterol, as well as in LDL phospholipids, proteins, and total LDL during the 24th to 40th weeks. LDL changes were most pronounced in alcoholic women who later produced FAS infants. Alcohol abuse also increased HDL3. Furthermore, in alcohol users, the normal increase in VLDL was accentuated, especially so in women with FAS infants, and that of HDL2 was reduced. The significance of the changes found remains obscure, but they may be related to impaired function of the fetoplacental unit.

N2  - Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that exposure to alcohol in utero is associated with altered immune capacity. The mechanisms underlying such abnormalities are not clear. However, the suggestion that reciprocal interactions between the immune and the nervous systems are necessary for a competent immune response may be relevant. This work examined the consequences of prenatal ethanol exposure on cellular immune responses and noradrenergic synaptic transmission in lymphoid organs of the adult C57B1/6 mice. Pregnant mice were fed a liquid diet containing 25% of the calories as ethanol (4.8% w/v) or pair-fed an isocaloric equivalent of this diet throughout gestation, followed by foster-nursing the neonates on normal dams. As young adults, mice exposed to ethanol prenatally displayed immunologic and selective neurochemical changes: (1) depressed ability to produce cellular immune responses, including contact hypersensitivity and a local graft-vs-host response, and (2) altered noradrenergic synaptic transmission, including enhanced norepinephrine turnover, and a reduction in norepinephrine levels and beta-adrenoceptor density in the thymus and spleen, but not the heart. However, both the integrity and compartmentation of noradrenergic nerve fibres in the spleen were intact. It is suggested that altered noradrenergic synaptic transmission selectively in lymphoid organs may contribute to the impaired immune capacity associated with fetal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Preventing alcohol related birth damage: A review
A1  - Waterson E.J.
A1  - Murray-Lyon I.M.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Since 1974 numerous clinical studies have made it clear that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy (in excess of 80 g or 8 units daily) can result in a child being born with a specific combination of physical and mental disabilities know as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. More moderate levels of intake (as little as 10 g of 1 unit daily) are associated with other fetal problems know as Fetal Alcohol Effects. The most common of these is growth retardation. Reduction of alcohol consumption is beneficial to pregnancy outcome. However, despite this great clinical and research interest within the field there has been comparatively little attention paid to researching possible preventative strategies and appropriate policy development. This paper first describes the size of the problem posed by drinking in pregnancy in the U.S.A. and the U.K., detailing the contrasting policy response on either side of the Atlantic. It examines the difficulties of formulating appropriate advice and then assesses the available research reports on preventative measures. The strategies described include general publicity and counselling for pregnant women. In addition, attention has been paid to the problems of dissemination by emphasising professional education. One major shortcoming is that most of these studies appear to have been carried out with little reference to existing knowledge on health education and promotion, or educational work in the antenatal or alcohol fields. In addition, little attention appears to have been paid to the characteristics of the groups at whom intervention might be targeted or the underlying social or psychological factors which maintain drinking in these groups. The second part of this paper, therfore, attempts to suggest appropriate avenues for developing preventative strategies by presenting a wide-ranging review with special reference to British experience. Particular attention is given to the issues of form and content of appropriate message, targeting of risk populations, the venue for intervention, and media and the actual mechanisms involved in implementing the programme. We conclude that women should be advised to limit their alcohol consumption to no more than one unit a day when they are either pregnant or planning a pregnancy. We recommend that pregnant women should be asked about their alcohol and given appropriate advice during routine antenatal clinic visits. We suggest that the form of advice should be designed with the characteristics of the risk population in mind. Information about appropriate levels of alcohol intake and further professional help for those in need should be widely available and from an integral part of the primary health service, as well as the antenatal and family planning clinics in addition to the more specialist alcohol treatment and preventation services already available.

T1  - Prediction of subsequent motor and mental retardation in newborn infants exposed to alcohol in utero by computerized EEG analysis
A1  - Ioffe S.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - In a prospective, blinded study 38 infants of mothers with varying quantities of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy had an EEG at 40 weeks post conceptional age. Bayley Development Tests were administered between 1.5 and 10 months of age. The total power of the EEG during REM sleep was inversely related to subsequent motor development (r = -0.51, F = 13.1, p < 0.0008) whereas the total power of the EEG during quiet sleep was inversely related to subsequent mental development (r = 0.61, F = 24.4, p < 0.0001). In alcohol exposed babies EEG abnormalities were present even in the absence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). In 16 older children born to abstainers or alcoholic mother similar results were obtained. Thus, the power of the EEG during REM and quiet sleep at birth appears to be a sensitive index of alcohol effects on the fetal brain and may be used to predict future motor and mental development.

N2  - This study examined the consequences of alcohol (ethanol) exposure during fetal life on lesion-induced dopaminergic synapse responsiveness (plasticity) in the olfactory tubercle of the adult rat. Normally, in the olfactory tubercle, olfactory bulbectomy elicits alterations in pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic markers, including, respectively, (1) increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity and immunoreactivity, which is associated with dopaminergic axon sprouting, and (2) increased dopaminergic receptor density and potentiated dopamine activation of adenylate cyclase. We have utilized biochemical and quantitative immunocytochemical methodology to examine these synaptic markers in olfactory bulbectomized or sham-operated adult rats. These animals were offspring of dams which were administered one of the following diets during pregnancy: (1) liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories ad libitum; (2) liquid diet containing an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin instead of ethanol, pair-fed; or (3) unaltered liquid diet ad libitum. The results show that prenatal alcohol exposure leads to suppression of the lesion-elicited dopaminergic synapse responsiveness in the olfactory tubercle. There were no significant differences between offspring born to control and pair-fed animals, indicating that the observed abnormalities were not due to alterations in their nutritional status. In conclusion, the present data are a biochemical and quantitative immunocytochemical demonstration of impaired lesion-induced synaptic responsiveness. This renders a new dimension in support of previous evidence indicating that prenatal alcohol exposure leads to altered neuroanatomical, neuroendocrinological and behavioral responsiveness to various challenges. Such impaired synaptic responsiveness may underlie brain functional abnormalities characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - T lymphocyte populations in fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Ewald S.J.
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - There are reports that fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with immune deficiency or DiGeorge syndrome. To investigate the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the immune system, we used a mouse model of FAS in which C57BL/6J female mice were fed a complete liquid diet containing 25% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) from gestational day (g.d.) 1 to 18. Thymus cell numbers were markedly reduced in 18-day fetuses exposed to ethanol. Thymocytes from fetuses from the 25% EDC diet group and from pair-fed and ad-libitum control diet groups were compared by flow cytometry for expression of T cell differentiation antigens. The proportions of L3T4- and Lyt-2 positive thymus cells were significantly reduced in alcohol-exposed fetuses compared to controls; however, the number of Thy-1-positive cells did not differ among any of the groups. Six-day old neonates exposed prenatally to ethanol from g.d. 1 to 13 had thymus and spleen T cell populations similar to those of controls in almost all cases, indicating a 'catch-up' of T cell numbers in most animals. Spleen T cell function, assessed by response to Concanavalin A (Con A), or Con A plus T cell growth factors, was somewhat depressed in ethanol-exposed 6-day pups.

Y1  - 1989//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption produces various abnormalities in the offspring, termed fetal alcohol syndrome. We investigated various biochemical modifications occurring in the brain and the liver of pups born to alcohol-consuming rats. The parameters analysed were: superoxide dismutase, a protector against free radicals injury, enolase isoenzymes as markers of nerve cell maturation, glutamine synthetase involved in ammonia detoxification, alcohol and aldehyde deshydrogenases in order to evaluate the contribution of acetaldehyde teratogenicity and ATPase activities involved in ion and neurotransmitter transport. Activities of all these enzymes were decreased in the brain even when alcohol was withdrawn from the mother diet either during pregnancy or lactation. Activities were also decreased in the liver, except enolase and alcohol deshydrogenase activities, which were increased, suggesting possible adaptative events in the presence of alcohol. It seems likely that the multiple alterations observed in experimental fetal alcohol syndrome may be caused by free radicals following decreased superoxide dismutase activity in addition to the toxicity of alcohol and its metabolites.

T1  - Drinking and smoking patterns amongst women attending an antenatal clinic - I. Before pregnancy
A1  - Waterson E.J.
A1  - Murray-Lyon I.M.
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - This paper provides basic epidemiological data on smoking and drinking patterns before pregnancy amongst 1117 pregnant women attending a London antenatal clinic. Similar data are already available from North America and surveys have been done in Scotland but there is a dearth of information from England and Wales. In the early stages of pregnancy, prior to recognition, heavy alcohol consumption (in excess of 56 units of alcohol per week) is associated with the Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. More moderate levels of intake (as little as 10 units of alcohol per week) have been associated with Foetal Alcohol Effects such as growth retardation. In our sample 19% of the mothers were drinking more than 10 units of alcohol per week. Six per cent were consuming more than the 14 units of alcohol currently recommended by three of the medical Royal Colleges as 'safe' for non-pregant women. Average weekly alcohol consumption was related to both the usual frequency and amount drunk, but also to binge drinking, beverage choice and combination, and reasons for drinking. In general, drinking was frequent and light. Those women who drank more per week tended to drink more frequently than those in the lower weekly consumption bands. Fourteen per cent of the sample admitted to binge drinking (more than 14 units of alcohol in a single sitting). Wine was the most popular beverage type. The range of beverages consumed was wider in the higher alcohol consumption bands. Those in the lower bands were more likely to drink only one beverage type. Social reasons for drinking were of far greater importance than reasons which emphasised the effects of drinking. However, heavy drinkers were unlikely to drink solely for social reasons. Seventy-seven per cent of the mothers were non-smokers, but the incidence of smoking increasesd in the higher alcohol consumption bands. The demographic characteristics of the smokers were in marked contrast to those of the heavier drinkers. Smokers tended to be younger, of lower social status and multiparous, whereas the heavier drinkers were more likely to be older, of higher social status and primiparous. This finding is of fundamental importance to those interested in planning screening or intervention programmes.

N2  - As a model of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) the rate of the maturation of the functions of the central nervous system was studied in the offspring of pregnant CFY rats receiving (from the 7th-15th day of gestation) either oral ethanol treatment or liquid diet containing ethanol. Both types of exposure caused numerous behavioural impairments, besides high perinatal mortality also the opening of the eyes and ears, and the appearance of postural reflexes were delayed. The newborn rats could be characterized by hyperactivity and weak motor coordination. The learning capacity, the avoidance conditioned reflexes was the poorest in the case of the offspring of mothers kept on liquid diet, containing alcohol, the latency of the conditioned response was significantly lenghtened. During reconditioning, in the case of the sexually already mature pups, the weakest performance was observed in the offspring of mothers having received oral alcohol treatment. This findings indicated, on one hand, that the retardation ceased and, on the other, that the learning and memory impairments caused by oral alcohol exposure was persistent. Following prenatal alcohol exposure carried out by different methods the neurotoxic effect, the retardation of the rate of maturation of the central nervous functions, and the adaptive mechanisms were all affected to different extent. Besides alcohol exposure also other factors (relative protein insufficiency, malnutrition) may be involved in the pathomechanism of the above mentioned phenomena.

A1  - Handa R.J.
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure has been shown to produce long-term feminizing and demasculinizing effects on male rat behaviors which are organizationally dependent upon perinatal androgen levels. Such exposure has previously been shown to suppress the normal surge of testosterone during the critical prenatal period. Since defeminization of male rate behavior is dependent upon estrogen derived from the aromatization of testosterone in brain, brain aromatase activity was measured during the perinatal period in males and females exposed to alcohol beginning on Day 14 of gestation. Aromatase activity was measured in whole hypothalamus of fetuses from Day 16 through 20 of gestation and in the hypothalamic preoptic area and amygdala of animals 6-12 hr postparturition. Hypothalamic aromatase activity was elevated in fetal alcohol exposed males compared to controls on Days 18 and 19 of gestation and on postnatal Day 1. No effect of prenatal alcohol exposure was found in females. A sex effect in aromatase activity in the amygdala was evident on Day 1 when activity was found to be greater in males than females. Overall, these findings indicate that fetal alcohol exposure will elevate regional brain aromatase activity in males, but not females during the perinatal period of neurobehavioral sexual differentiation.

T1  - Alcohol-related birth defects: An update
A1  - Warren K.R.
A1  - Bast R.J.
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Historically, mankind has at least suspected that alcohol was somehow connected with undesirable effects on progeny. In the 18th century, physicians became aware that maternal alcohol consumption resulted in excess fetal and neonatal mortality, low birth weight, and many other deleterious effects. Perhaps as a response to the temperance and Prohibition periods, scientists lost sight of or interest in the effects of alcohol in pregnancy. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the issue surfaced again, and scientists began systematic and in-depth studies of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Epidemiologic research now suggests that FAS has outranked Down's syndorme and spina bifida in prevalence and is now the leading known cause of mental retardation. Further, it is the only one of these three that is preventable. Because a safe limit of alcohol consumption in pregnancy is not defined, abstinence during pregnancy is the most prudent preventive measure. Factors such as race, beer drinking, maternal weight gain, and low socioeconomic status are associated with a statistical increase in the incidence of FAS. In families where one child has been diagnosed as having FAS, the incidence rate can be as much as 405-fold higher than the worldwide average. Neurobehavioral deficits can occur in the offspring of drinking mothers in the absence of a diagnosis of full FAS. The deficits differ with age and seem to persist into adulthood. Mental retardation or borderline mental retardation is a nearly ubiquitous neurological deficit in diagnosed FAS. In one study, it occurred in 75 percent of the non-FAS offspring of mothers who continued to drink heavily throughout their pregnancy. From the mid-1970s, having established that alcohol is a teratogen, scientists have been trying to uncover the mechanism by which alcohol exerts its embryotoxic effects. Recent promising neuroanatomical studies have demonstrated that alcohol has a deleterious effect on neuronal migration and hence on the development of the cerebral cortex. Other studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure, by adversely affecting hippocampal development, may be responsible for the learning deficits so frequently encountered in FAS children. Other research has implicated prostaglandins in the mechanism of alcohol-related dysmorphology.

T1  - Alcohol counselling of 85 pregnant problem drinkers: Effect on drinking and fetal outcome
A1  - Halmesmaki E.
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Eighty-five pregnant problem drinkers were given intensive counselling throughout gestation to persuade them to reduce or stop their alcohol intake. Nevertheless, 7% of their blood specimens collected at follow-up visits contained ethanol. Fifty-five women (65%) were able to reduce their alcohol consumption by at least 50%. Alcohol abuse was associated in a dose-dependent manner with fetal growth retardation detectable by ultrasonography from 27 weeks gestation. Twenty infants (24%) had a complete fetal alcohol syndrome and 22 (26%) had some features of 'fetal alcohol effects' (FAE). In addition, the rate of structural malformations was high (13%). Of the women with continuous alcohol abuse 89% gave birth to infants with at least one feature of FAE compared with only 49% of those who decreased their alcohol consumption.

N2  - The effect of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and lactation on -aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in different rat brain regions of 3-week-old pups was investigated. There was a significant decrease in the thalamus, pons, cerebellum and hippocampus, no change in posterior colliculus, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, hypothalamus, septum or striatum and a significant increase in frontal cortex, olfactory bulbs, anterior colliculus and amygdala. These modifications could be a consequence of alterations in membrane permeability and may be related to the behavioural disorders associated with the fetal-alcohol syndrome.

N2  - A congenital alcoholic syndrome (CAS) belongs to rarely diagnosed embryopathies . It consists of polysymptomatic misdevelopings in numerous organs of the fetus caused by alcoholic abuse through the mother during the pregnancy. The diagnosis of the CAS is established on the basis of following topics: the anamnesis confirming the chronic alcoholism of baby's mother, the excluding of congenital genetic defects and intrauterine infections as well as qualitative and quantitative feeding deficits. In the differential diagnosis should be taken congenital cranial and facial dysmorphies which are most often seen in many syndromes such as: Pierre-Robin, Treacher-Collins, Weyer , Franceschetti - Zwahlen . In the presented paper there is described one case of the CAS observed during 15 months clinically and radiologically.

N2  - In contrast to the well-known picture of the 'fetal alcohol syndrome' (FAS), clinical symptoms of the incomplete FAS are less frequently recognized compared to the high incidence of the syndrome as stated in the literature. The diagnostic problem is a clear differentiation between mild forms of the incomplete FAS and clinical normality. Post-natal growth deficiency and microcephaly of unknown aetiology, clinical symptoms of hyperactivity, learning disabilities or mild mental retardation are the main features of the incomplete FAS. The diagnosis is established only by a positive history of maternal alcohol abuse.

Y1  - 1983//
N2  - Changes in the drinking and smoking habits of pregnant women in Seattle, Washington, were examined in the 6-year period that followed the first American announcement of the fetal alcohol syndrome. Between 1974/1975 and 1980/1981, the number of women who reported any alcohol use around the time of the first prenatal visit dropped from 81% to 42%, whereas the number of smokers dropped from 25% to 22%; binge and heavier drinking also declined. However, among drinkers, there was no decrease in the proportion of women who reported heavier drinking. Although the proportion of women who drink during pregnancy has decreased in the past 6 years, the relative constancy in the proportion of 'heavier' drinkers and binge drinkers, particularly around the time of conception, suggests the need for more attention to this important period of gestation in advice to women who are planning a pregnancy. Possible reasons for such changes in this particular community are discussed.

T1  - Prenatal loss in the rat following moderate consumption of alcohol incorporated in a liquid diet
A1  - Persaud T.V.N.
Y1  - 1983//
N2  - The teratogenic potential of alcohol in humans has now been confirmed, and a characteristic pattern of anomalies (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) is found in infants born to mothers who are chronic alcoholics. The pathogenesis of the fetal alcohol syndrome is unclear: very little is known about the way alcohol acts during pregnancy and alters fetal growth and morphogenesis. The objective of this investigation was to determine the effects of a widely used ethanol liquid diet in the pregnant rat. The ethanol liquid test diet is based on the Lieber-De Carli formula. 20 Sprague-Dawley rats were matched closely by weights and assigned in pairs to either an alcohol treated or a pair-fed control group. Control animals received the same amount of the liquid diet with maltose-dextrins substituted isocalorically for the ethanol. Graduated tubes were used for the oral delivery of the diets. Ethanol was gradually introduced into the diet as follows: 100 Kcal/l, days 1-2; 200 Kcal/l, days 3-5; 350 Kcal/l, days 6-12. Following this initial treatment period, all animals were then given rodent pellets and tap water ad libitum. The mothers showed no overt signs of gross toxicity. The mean maternal weight gain of the ethanol treated animals did not differ significantly from the controls. The incidence of fetal resorptions was increased, intrauterine growth was not affected and the offspring at term appeared normal. The results indicate that moderate alcohol consumption during early gestation in the rat led to significant prenatal loss but proved to be non-teratogenic.

N2  - Twenty children affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol are described. Their mothers either suffered from chronic alcoholism, or were binge or heavy drinkers while pregnant. Only in nine mothers (45%) was alcohol abuse recognized and associated with their babies' anomalies in the first months after birth; in some, the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome was delayed for many years. Alcohol abuse in pregnancy is probably a significant cause of birth and developmental defects in Australian children.

N2  - To investigate the teratogenic effect of acute alcohol exposure, pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 25% ethanol (either two doses of 2.9 g/kg or one dose 5.8 g/kg) during the organogenic period either by intraperitoneal injections or by intubation. The incidence of malformations varied according to (1) the stage of embryonic development at the time of exposure, (2) the route of administration of the alcohol, and (3) the amount of alcohol given and the time period over which it was administered. Oral doses of alcohol were teratogenic although less so than the same dose given intraperitoneally, and two intraperitoneal doses four hours apart produced significantly more malformations than the same two doses six hours apart. The primary metabolite of alcohol, acetaldehyde, was also investigated for its teratogenicity. It was found that one or two doses of four percent acetaldehyde (0.32 g/kg), administered intraperitoneally were teratogenic. A further attempt was made to raise blood acetaldehyde levels by exposing mice to disulfiram, an inhibitor of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, prior to administration of alcohol. The disulfiram pretreatment did not increase the malformation rate. Treatment with alcohol on day 7 or 8 caused a variety of facial abnormalities, some of which were comparable to those seen in children with fetal alcohol syndrome. Exposure on day 9 or 10 resulted in limb defects. The results suggest that one or more episodes of heavy maternal drinking at critical periods in pregnancy may severely damage the embryo and may produce many features of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 1983//
N2  - Alcohol can cause adverse effects at all levels of the nervous system, and it crosses the placenta. Occult brain damage occurs before clinical effects are apparent, as demonstrated by abnormal head CT scans in neurologically intact individuals. The fetal alcohol syndrome can occur in the absence of maternal signs of alcoholism and in a partial form, which, in isolated cases, is difficult to identify and relate to alcohol.

N2  - Forty children with the fetal alcohol syndrome were identified in the west of Scotland. All were growth retarded and had abnormal facial features, and all those who were tested were found to have neurological or developmental abnormalities. Two children died of associated physical defects. Most of the mothers were socially deprived, and all had drunk heavily while pregnant. Three women had subsequently died. These findings provide clear evidence that in the west of Scotland maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a distinct pattern of malformation and mental impairment, to date associated only with advanced stages of maternal alcoholism. Children born to alcoholics are at risk for a wide range of problems, including one or a few of the characteristics of FAS. However, moderate to heavy drinking women, as a group, have a significantly increased probability of delivering smaller babies and having children who show some mild behavioral differences compared to controls whose mothers drink much less or not at all. The present review focuses primarily on recent scientific and medical findings and their implications for future research and prevention efforts.

N2  - At the present time when so much attention is being paid to birth rates and planned pregnancies as well as to a general lowering of perinatal mortality and of prematurity and morbidity, we find that maternal alcoholism is a real medico-social problem for the community. Studying alcoholism in pregnant women has made it possible to work out a profile of the type of woman involved. The risk to the fetus was calculated not only in accordance with the quantities of alcohol taken and their metabolic effects on the embryo, the fetus and the newborn, but also on the general nutritional states (including lipids) and their effects, especially on the development of the brain. These different facts make it possible for us to work out a way of detecting and observing the woman closely during her pregnancy by carrying out repeated and combined tests especially on the level of alcohol in the blood and the level of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in the plasma. The consequences of maternal alcoholism are examined as to their effects during the progress of the pregnancy itself (abortion, prematurity and mortality) and especially on the product of the conception with its characteristic fetal alcohol syndrome (including a description of its, its incidence and the influence of previous alcoholism as well as the future of the child). The conclusion shows how important it is to do everything possible in the antenatal and post-natal clinics to prevent the condition but also to 'salvage' these children as far as possible when they have been born to alcoholic mothers so as to improve their nutritional and psycho-social states.

N2  - To study the effect of paternal chronic ethanol consumption on fetal development, an experimental rat model was established and compared to the fetal alcohol syndrome. Male and female Wistar rats were divided into 30% ethanol (E) and control groups. Before mating and during pregnancy the ethanol group and control group received E and water, respectively. Pregnancies were terminated on gestational day 21. The body weight, liver weight, blood glucose, serum insulin and cerebral CNPase activity were decreased in alcoholic males. The adverse effect of maternal chronic ethanol on fetal development was shown clearly and was not related to paternal ethanol. The adverse effect of paternal alcoholism on the fetus was shown in decreased litter size, or decreased body weight, cerebral weight and cerebral DNA, RNA and leucine incorporation into protein without a decrease in the litter size. The former finding was observed in the fetuses of aged male and female rats and latter in the fetuses of young female rats. In conclusion, both observations in our study indicate the adverse effect of paternal alcoholism on the fetal development.

N2  - In the past three years, we have seen three children who required prolonged inpatient admissions for severe feeding dysfunction resulting in nutritional and growth problems. The pregnancies were significant for severe maternal alcohol abuse during the entire pregnancy. All of the subjects had multiple physical findings and dysmorphic features seen in children with mild to severe fetal alcohol syndrome. Feeding evaluations showed significant delays in oral motor development. Specific oral motor dysfunction was not a commonality and did not appear to be a major determinant in delays in feeding development. Continued assessment revealed that the babies had limited suck patterns and were consistently noted to tire easily. Each required feeding by either gastrostomy and/or nasogastric feeding for prolonged periods of time. They started initial feeding by mouth at about 8 to 10 months. The times for complete oral feeding were 14, 17 and 18 months.

A1  - Friedman J.M.
Y1  - 1982//
N2  - The importance of the teratogenic effects of ethanol have become increasingly well appreciated since the description of the fetal alcohol syndrome in 1973. Typical fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in babies exposed throughout gestation to chronic, heavy maternal alcohol ingestion (90 ml or more of absolute alcohol daily). We have recently seen three patients with neural tube defects and a history of maternal alcohol abuse during early gestation. In two of these cases, there were few or no stigmata of fetal alcohol syndrome. These observations suggest that exposure of an embryo to alcohol during neurulation may produce neural tube defects, even if the exposure is insufficient to cause typical stigmata of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - A study of 1,690 mother/child pairs at Boston City Hospital was conducted to assess the impact of maternal alcohol consumption on fetal development when confounding variables were controlled. Level of maternal drinking prior to pregnancy was associated with shorter duration of gestation. Lower maternal weight change, history of maternal illnesses, cigarette smoking, and marijuana use, however, were more consistently related to adverse fetal growth and development. New findings in this study include a negative association between maternal marijuana use during pregnancy and fetal growth. Also when confounding variables were controlled, women who used marijuana during pregnancy were five times more likely to deliver infants with features considered compatible with the fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Presented is a review of the clinical manifestations of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the mode of action in this syndrome, the maternal malnutrition that may occur, and consideration that may prevent the development of FAS in the fetus. Several factors are discussed that may help explain the abnormalities noted in infants with FAS. Education regarding the dangers of alcohol abuse for pregnant women is essential in prevent the development of fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol-related birth defects.

N2  - Female Sprague-Dawley rats were either given 20% alcohol in drinking water and solid diet ad libitum (alcohol group) or were pair-fed to the alcohol group (pair-fed group) or were given water and solid diet ad libitum (ad libitum group) for four weeks. They were then mated and the alcohol group was changed to 30% alcohol in water. On day 20 gestation each rat was injected with 57Co-labeled microspheres into the left ventricle and radioactivity was determined in the placentas and kidneys. Cardiac output and blood flow to the placentas and kidneys was calculated. Fetuses and placentas were weighted, and the osmolality of the maternal plasma and water content of the muscle was determined. Cardiac output and blood flow to the kidneys did not differ among the three groups. Blood flow to the placenta, whether expressed as ml/min/g placenta or ml/min/placenta, or as % of cardiac output was significantly reduced in the alcohol group compared with the pair-fed and ad libitum groups, which did not differ from one another. Fetuses were significantly lighter and placentas were significantly heavier in the alcohol group than in the other two groups. Plasma osmolality was increased and muscle water was decreased about 7% in the alcohol group, indicating a moderate degree of dehydration. It is concluded that chronic alcohol consumption leads to a redistribution of blood, with less blood supplying the placentas. This may contribute to the growth retardation seen in fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Polydactyly and polysyndactyly of the great toes of the hindpaws and polysyndactyly of the forepaws were observed in rats born to mothers who received ethanol (5 mg/kg body weight) daily during gestation. This is the first observation of polydactyly in rats as a consequence to exposure to ethanol in utero. These observations may be related to the occurrence of polydactyly and polysyndactyly in the fetal alcohol syndrome, which occurs in children born to human mothers who abuse alcohol during pregnancy.

Y1  - 1981//
N2  - The effects of alcohol on the fetus include a wide range of problems; the complete fetal alcohol syndrome is the extreme end of the spectrum. At critical doses alcohol has the potential for multiple adverse effects on the maternal-placental-fetal system. Variability of outcome probably is related to individual differences in drinking patterns as well as in biologic susceptibility. At Boston City Hospital Prenatal Clinic, therapy was provided for pregnant women who reported drinking heavily. Reduction in maternal alcohol consumption before the third trimester was associated with improved neonatal outcome. The obstetrician's office is a potential site for prevention programs. A 10-question drinking history enables physicians to identify pregnant women at risk. Supportive counseling focused on reduction of alcohol use can be integrated with regular prenatal care. Pregnant women who do not respond promptly should be referred to specialized treatment programs. This strategy has the potential to improve the health of both mother and infant.

N2  - This study investigates contingent negative variation (CNV) in ten children diagnosed as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and ten control children whose mothers reported only infrequent drinking during pregnancy. Cortical potentials were obtained using a procedure similar to Cohen's (1976) design. Stimuli consisted of a randomly presented flash followed 1.5 sec later by a tone. Sixty-four trials were presented with tone offset under experimenter control. For the next 128 trials, the subject pushed a button to turn off the tone. The EEG was recorded from Cz, P3, and P4 referred to linked earlobes. In addition, a resting EEG was obtained prior to the start of the trials. Cortical potentials were averaged separately over the two sets of trials and measures of slope and integrated amplitude obtained. Preliminary analysis showed that four of ten FAS children had negative slopes while eight of ten control children had negative slopes. These differences between groups, while in the predicted direction, were not statistically significant. Additional analyses are in progress.

N2  - Children diagnosed as FAS using standard criteria of maternal alcoholism, poor growth, delayed development and characteristic facial appearance underwent an investigative protocol involving skeletal x-ray surveys, cardiac assessments and intravenous pyelograms (IVP). Significant skeletal findings included cervical spine fusion in 20 of 46 children (43%), x-ray confirmation of microcephaly in 26/49 (53%) and abnormal thoracic cage development in 13/48 (27%). Thirty-nine of 54 children (72%) demonstrated a characteristic tapering of the shaft and occasional associated prominence of the tuft of the distal phalanges. Bone age was delayed 2 standard deviations or greater in 14 of 51 children (27%). Cardiac lesions were found in 31 of 76 (41%) and a further 12 (16%) had functional murmurs. Lesions were ventricular septal defect 20 (26%), Tetralogy of Fallot 4 (5.1%), plus a variety of less frequent abnormalities. IVP's were limited to 19 random cases with 5 (26%) showing alterations from the normal. Cervical spine abnormalities of FAS as compared to the Klippel-Feil Syndrome are dissimilar and probably represent a different entity. Hand and lateral cervical spine x-ray studies are felt to be a useful adjunct to the diagnosis and management of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Numerous studies have appeared in the literature which suggest that paternal alcohol consumption may have adverse effects on subsequent offspring. However, to date, no teratologic examination has been performed on fetuses conceived subsequent to paternal alcohol consumption. The present study has examined fetuses conceived by alcohol-treated male Swiss webster mice for gross anatomical congenital defects in an attempt to evaluate of possible mechanism for decreased viability of offspring sired by alcoholic males. Sexually mature males males were maintained for 28 days of a total liquid nutriment diet in which alcohol (6.3%, v/v, U.S.P. ethanol) comprised 32% of the caloric content. Subsequently, the animals were mated with nulliparous females. On day 18 of gestation, the gravid females were sacrificed and the fetuses were examined for congenital defects. Only 14% of the matings which occurred 3-5 days after alcohol treatment resulted in pregnancy, as alcohol-treated males during this time had reduced birth weight (0.85 +/- 0.04 g vs 0.92 +/- 0.11 g; p = 0.059) and crown-rump lengths (1.83 +/- 0.06 cm vs 1.99 +/- 0.11 cm; p<0.001) as compared to control fetuses. The frequency of congenital defects did not differ significantly between the experimental and control groups. No significant differences were noted between experimental and control progeny conceived more than 5 days after alcohol treatment. These results suggest that although some changes may be seen in progeny sired by alcohol treated males, the specific anomalies associated with the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome are most probably not due to paternal alcoholism.

T1  - Endocrine balance as a factor in the etiology of the fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Anderson Jr. R.A.
Y1  - 1981//
N2  - It is well documented that children with the fetal alcohol syndrome are a direct consequence of heavy maternal ethanol consumption during pregnancy. The mechanism by which ethanol exerts its teratogenic effect is however, far from understood. Recent experimental evidence has shown alcohol to have a direct inhibitory effect on embryogenesis. Little information, however, is available concerning other factors associated with maternal drinking which may contribute to abnormal fetal development. Proper materno-fetal hormonal balance is essential to insure successful pregnancy outcome. Of particular importance with respect to normal fetal development, are the levels of placental tropic hormones; pituitary hormones such as prolactin and oxytocin; adrenal cortical hormones; both maternal and fetal thyroid hormones; maternal and fetal sex hormones; and maternal insulin. Ethanol alters the levels of a variety of hormones associated with the hypothalamic/pituitary-gonadal, -adrenal and -thyroid axes. Many of these alterations have been observed in the male, however, with little data available on the female. In spite of the known adverse effect of ethanol on certain aspects of female reproductive function, few if any studies have examined the effects of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy on maternal endocrine balance. It is hoped that the present review will provide a rationale for the examination of alcohol effects on maternal endocrine hormones, as well as to provide possible target areas with respect to fetal development subsequent to ethanol-induced endocrine imbalance.

N2  - Alcohol was administered in a vitamin-supplemented liquid diet (Stardit) to Wistar rats 4 weeks before mating and during pregnancy. Of the daily calories 38-40% were supplied by alcohol and by isocaloric sucrose in the controls. Offspring of alcohol drinking dams showed a reduced birth weight and gained weight less rapidly than the controls. On day 3, 4, 7, 12, 17 and 21, experimental animals and controls were perfused for histological and electron microscopic investigations. Morphometric analysis of the cerebella (Fol. 5 and Fol. 8) showed no difference in the number of Purkinje cells. However, on day 7 the Purkinje cell nuclei of experimental pups were significantly smaller. This difference disappeared at day 12. Electron microscopic investigations in the 4, 7, and 12 days old experimental animals revealed a delayed cytoplasmic maturation of Purkinje cells which mainly involved the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At 17 days, there was no difference between the two groups. These data are discussed in relation to alcohol-induced metabolic changes in the brain.

T1  - Effects of alcohol on the fetus: Impact and prevention
A1  - Little R.E.
A1  - Streissguth A.P.
Y1  - 1981//
N2  - In the spectrum of adverse effects on the fetus or infant associated with maternal drinking during pregnancy the most dramatic is the fetal alcohol syndrome, a pattern of malformation that has been associatd with maternal alcohol abuse. Other undesirable outcomes of pregnancy linked to alcohol exposure in utero include growth deficiency, major and minor anomalies, decrements in mental and motor performance, and fetal and perinatal wastage. Alcohol, like other teratogens, does not uniformly affect all those exposed to it. Rather, there seems to be a continuum of effects of alcohol on the fetus with increasingly severe outcomes generally associated with higher intakes of alcohol by the mother. The cost of fetal damage associated with alcohol exposure is very high. A program to decrease the incidence of fetal alcohol effects is therefore imperative. The cornerstone of such a program must be not only education of the public but also careful training of all professionals who provide health care for pregnant women.

T1  - Alcohol and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy
A1  - Sokol R.J.
Y1  - 1981//
N2  - Heavy alcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy has long been suspected of being a risk factor for abnormalities in the fetus or infant. Only during the last decade have these assumptions been supported by scientific studies. A clustering of fetal defects observed in some cases has been labelled the fetal alcohol syndrome. The syndrome involves prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, central nervous sytem involvement and craniofacial abnormalities, some of which are characteristic of the syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome is relatively rare, affecting from 1 in 300 to 1 in 2000 infants; approximately 450 cases have been reported since the syndrome was identified. Despite this rarity, however, heavy alcohol consumption is an important risk factor during pregnancy. A review of the current literature indicates that in animals alcohol in high doses is embryotoxic and teratogenic, that heavy drinking is not uncommon before and during pregnancy and that the fetal alcohol syndrome and other effects on the fetus associated with alcohol abuse appear with significant frequency among mothers who drink heavily. Heavy alcohol consumption is a perinatal risk factor that not only can be detected by the physician, but also can be reduced in concerned, cooperative patients. Thus, awareness of this problem gives health care personnel an opportunity to help in the prevention of abnormal outcomes of pregnancy.

T1  - The passage of ethanol administered orally in the pregnant mouse to the fetus and its liquor amnii
A1  - Kaufman M.H.

Y1  - 1981//
N2  - As the fetal alcohol syndrome is now regarded as the third commonest cause of congenital mental deficiency in man, it is surprising that little attention has been paid to the build up and concentration of ethanol in the tissues of the mother and fetus after oral administration of the agent. The recent introduction of the Alcolometer (Lion Laboratories Ltd) now makes it possible to make rapid and accurate measurements of ethanol levels in all tissues. We have used the Alcolometer to investigate the relationship between the time of administration of ethanol in the pregnant mouse and its concentration in certain maternal and fetal tissues, and in the liquor amnii. The extremely rapid concentration of ethanol in the maternal and fetal compartments suggests one reason at least why so called 'binge' drinking in early pregnancy is a potent cause of damage to the developing embryo. Another significant finding is the relationship between the levels of ethanol found in the fetus and liquor amnii respectively. This suggests that the fetus urinates ethanol into the liquor amnii, thereby setting up a to-and-fro distribution of ethanol between the fetus and the liquor, and producing a prolonged period of teratogenicity on the part of the agent.

T1  - Epidemiological appraisal of the literature on the fetal alcohol syndrome in humans
A1  - Neugut R.H.
Y1  - 1981//
N2  - An evaluation of the evidence regarding the association between heavy maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy and the occurrence in offspring of that cluster of abnormalities called the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is undertaken from an epidemiological perspective. Areas of concern in assessing the literature include the objectivity with which the maternal drinking history was obtained, the nature, systematic or not, of examination of offspring, the presence or absence of a comparison group, the control for potentially confounding factors and, perhaps most important of all, whether or not the identification of a case was made blind to knowledge of the maternal drinking history. While well-documented evidence that can implicate a hypothesized teratogen is difficult to obtain, the data available concerning the effects of in utero exposure to high doses of alcohol must be carefully and thoughtfully scrutinized so that valid inferences may be drawn. In this review particular attention is focused on the nature of the association between in utero alcohol exposure and mental retardation, certainly the most devastating of the FAS features.

N2  - It has now become evident that alcohol is teratogenic to the fetus. However, the more subtle effects of alcohol on the fetus, and its subsequent effects on the developing child, are less well known, particularly in relation to borderline or retarded intelligence. What is uncertain is the amount of alcohol required to produce fetal damage, and the effect of a single excessive intake of alcohol during the organogenetic period in which the growing fetus is most susceptible. This paper reviews the current literature on the subject of alcohol in pregnancy and the fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - The scientific literature was reviewed for data on the incidence of alcohol-related birth defects in the general population and among heavy and for data on rates of heavy drinking among pregnant women in the U.S. These rates were applied to live births in New York State. It was calculated that approximately 386 children with the full-blown fetal alcohol syndrome and 1,563 with alcohol-related birth defects were born in New York State in 1978. The lifetime cost of providing medical care, remedial education, and custodial care for this cohort of children was estimated at over $155 million. Limitations of the estimation procedures and in the data available on the incidence and cost of alcohol-related birth defects are discussed.

A1  - Anandam N.

Y1  - 1980//
N2  - The fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized behaviorally by mental retardation, which is usually accompanied by growth retardation as well. Studies with rats were carried out to assess the effects of alcohol in utero on preweanling learning and memory, in the absence of growth and developmental deficiencies. In Experiment 1,4 g ethanol/kg was intubated in a liquid diet twice daily to rats on gestation days 6-21. When tested on day 12 on an appetitively-motivated straight alley task, ethanol treated pups did not differ from controls in rate of acquisition or extinction. In Experiment 2, ethanol was administered to dams via a high-protein liquid diet containing 30% ethanol derived calories between gestation day 6 to delivery. When tested on day 10 on an appetitively-motivated Y-maze discrimination task, ethanol treated pups required more trials to reach criterion during acquisition and reversal than controls. On day 12, the groups did not differ significantly on the performance of the previously acquired response. These results indicate that prenatal ethanol-induced impairments of learning (if sufficiently complex) are present in rat pups as early as 10 days of age.

T1  - Teratogenic effects of ethanol in human beings
A1  - Nitowsky H.M.
Y1  - 1980//
N2  - Clinical and epidemiologic studies during the past decade have strongly implicated alcohol as a teratogen for human beings. Evidence supporting this contention has been obtained in studies on various species of experimental animals. Maternal alcohol use during gestation can result in the fetal alcohol syndrome characterized by somatic growth retardation, abnormalities of the central nervous system with psychomotor retardation and disturbances in behavior, and a cluster of facial dysmorphic features. Clinical observations suggest that more subtle manifestations of alcohol teratogenicity can occur, such as a reduction in mean birth weight with no other apparent somatic effects, or milder central nervous system effects presenting in later childhood as learning disability or behavioral deficits. There is no evidence in support of a safe threshold for alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Although no simple dose-response relationship has been defined, clinical observations indicate that heavier maternal alcohol use during gestation is associated with a greater frequency and severity of adverse pregnancy outcomes. These include a higher risk for early spontaneous abortion and a higher perinatal mortality rate. Many of these and related issues may be resolved with prospective studies correlating maternal alcohol use and pregnancy outcome, particularly if more objective quantitative measures of alcohol consumption can be employed.

N2  - Piglets from 12 litters farrowed by 18-mo-old, first litter (L1) alcohol-consuming dams were evaluated for altered morphology. A second group of piglets, farrowed by six 3-yr-old, second litter (L2) alcohol-consuming dams, was also evaluated. Litters from 6 non-alcohol-consuming gilts and 6 non-alcohol-consuming sows were used as controls. Mean litter size and birth weight for L1 and L2 piglets were significantly less than controls. Fetal mortality rates for L1 and L2 piglets were much greater than controls. Anomaly rates observed in fetal deaths were 11% and 100% for L1 and L2, respectively; no anomalies were seen in the control group piglets. Anomalies observed in group L1 included prolapsed rectum, undescended testicle, hypoplastic testicular tissue, and microphthalmia. Anomalies seen in group L2 included one occurrence of each of the following: anencephaly, microcephaly, cranial bone hypoplasia, microphthalmia, cleft palate, hypoplasia of extremities, hypodactylia, polydactylia, cryptorchism, hypoplastic gonadal tissue, cloacal atresia, and two occurrences of micrognathia, syndactylia, and hypoplasia of tail. Open-field activity behavioral studies show significantly greater activity in the offspring of alcohol-consuming dams. The data from Sinclair (S-1) miniature swine support the data from other species, establishing the relationship between maternal alcohol consumption and fetal anomalies.

The diagnostic and social importance of seeking further affected family members, and the influence of associated adverse factors are discussed. The concept of a critical period in gestation, or 'binge' susceptibility of the fetus and a spectrum of FAS presentations are described. An increasing prevalence of FAS may be expected with current alcohol consumption trends in Australian females. A possible plan of management of 'at-risk' mothers is briefly outlined.

N2  - CBA, C3H, and C57 female mice maintained on a diet of 20 percent ethanol-derived calories prior to and throughout gestation were mated in a diallele cross. Prenatal death, malformations, and fetal weights were directly related to maternal blood alcohol levels, indicating a maternal effect. Fetal abnormalities and maternal blood alcohol levels varied with maternal strain (CBA > C3H > C57) and were inversely related to maternal alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Microsomal ethanol oxidizing systems induction was directly associated with increased fetal abnormalities, being greatest in CBA females. These results indicate that liability for the pattern of malformation observed in this syndrome is dependent on maternal blood alcohol levels, which are determined by the rate of maternal alcohol metabolism as well as the amount of maternal alcohol consumption.

N2  - Retrospective and prospective investigations of children to alcoholic women gave an incidence of fetal alcohol lesion of one per 300 deliveries of whom half had the complete fetal alcohol syndrome. Perinatal and infant mortalities were increased seven to tenfold and low birth weight (< 2500 g), preterm deliveries (<37 weeks) and smallness for gestational age (<-2 S.D.) were increased eightfold, threefold and twelvefold, respectively. Small size at birth correlated with reduced mental performance later in life, 58% had IQ below 85 and 19% below 70. 8% had cerebral palsy. The incidence of cerebral palsy associated with maternal inebriety was 1/5000 deliveries, i.e., every sixth case of cerebral palsy. Tracing of alcoholic women during pregnancy and treatment had favourable effects on intrauterine growth when sobriety could be induced early in pregnancy but could not protect from functional brain disturbance measured by neurological performance and by evoked response electroencephalography. Damage to the fetus by alcohol is now the largest known health hazard by a noxious agent that is preventable.

N2  - Maternal alcoholism can cause fetal damages irreversibly compromizing either the somatic or the mental development. It can also giving rise to malformations of various organs, particularly of the C.N.S. Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by a serious defect of growth by typical dysmorphic features and behavior anomalies which are recognizable already in the neonatal age. Therapeutic possibilities do not exist for affected subjects; the only remedy for the moment is the prevention of pregnancy in chronic alcoholic women, which obviously presents various difficulties and problems.

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) describes a pattern of dysmorphogenesis observed in some offspring of women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy; partial expression of this pattern are fetal alcohol effects (FAE). The purpose of this investigation was to measure selected craniofacial parameters in the CD-1 mouse fetus following exposure to alcohol on gestational day (D) 8. CD-1 mice were mated for 1 hr; D0.0 designated by the presence of a vaginal plug. On D8, 0 hr, and D8, 4 hr, 33 dams were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 25% (v/v) alcohol in physiological saline solution (0.015 ml/gm maternal body weight). Appropriate controls were maintained. The animals were sacrificed every 12 hr from D12.0 through D17.0. Implantation sites were examined and recorded as live, dead, or resorbed fetuses. All live fetuses were weighed, examined for gross defects, and fixed in Bouin's solution. Twenty-three bilateral parameters were recorded for linear dimensions defining face and cranium. The fetal weights were statistically lower in treated as compared to control fetuses only on D16.0 through D17.0. Statistical analysis of the morphometrics identified five distinct growth patterns in treated mice as compared to controls. The anomalies induced in the CD-1 mouse fetus following exposure to alcohol on D8.0 resembled FAE rather than FAS. Morphometric analysis of the cranofacial region may be an important clinical tool for the quantitative identification of alcohol-related effects in the offspring of women who consumed alcohol while pregnant.

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes malformations of the eyes with serious consequences to the vision of the affected children. A high percentage (up to 90%) of children suffering from the fetal alcohol syndrome have eye abnormalities, including malformation in the outer eye region, disorders of motility, and defects of different intraocular structures. Two kinds of malformations stand out as most typical - hypoplasia of the optic nervehead (up to 48%) and increased tortuosity of the retinal vessels, especially of the arteries (up to 49%). Visual acuity is often moderately or severely reduced. Considering the developmental timing of different tissues of the eye, one can presume that there is a risk for deleterious effects of alcohol on eye structures at any point of time from early gestation until development is completed.

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - Serum estradiol, estriol, progesterone, PRL, and hCG concentrations were measured at 4-week intervals in 40 pregnant women who chronically abused alcohol and in 20 abstinent pregnant women. Sixteen alcohol users gave birth to infants with the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), whereas the remaining 24 infants of alcohol users and all infants of the abstinent women were healthy. The women whose infants had the FAS had decreased estradiol and estriol levels throughout pregnancy. Progesterone levels also tended to be low. In contrast, the alcohol users had increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy compared with those in the abstinent women, but this rise was not related to the FAS. The concentrations of hCG fluctuated widely, without any consistent difference between alcohol users and abstinent women. Thus, heavy maternal abuse of alcohol resulting in FAS is accompanied, primarily or secondarily, by reduced estrogen concentrations throughout pregnancy and increased PRL levels during the 16-24th week of pregnancy.

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - As part of the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Questionnaire administered in the 1985 National Health Interview Survey, nearly 20,000 respondents ages 18-44 answered questions about their awareness of the risks of smoking and heavy drinking during pregnancy. In reference to smoking, interviewers asked about miscarriage, still-birth, prematurity, and low birth weight; in reference to heavy drinking, they asked about miscarriage, mental retardation low birth weight, and birth defects, as well as fetal alcohol syndrome. For each of these adverse outcomes, a majority of subjects acknowledged increased risk because of smoking or heavy drinking during pregnancy. The range was 66-80 percent of respondents for the four questions on smoking, with the perceived association to smoking strongest for low birth weight. Approximately 84 percent of respondents associated heavy drinking with increased risk for each of the suggested pregnancy outcomes. Smoking seemed to be perceived to pose a lesser risk to pregnency than heavy drinking. This relative lack of awareness of the pregnancy risks of smoking was more apparent among respondents with less education and more pronounced among blacks than whites. Women were more likely than men to express some opinion on these pregnancy-related questions and were more cognizant than men of the risks. On this limited survey, Americans ages 18-44 were not very knowledgeable about fetal alcohol syndrome. Among the 55 percent who had heard of fetal alcohol syndrome, fewer than one in four correctly identified it as a set of birth defects when offered three possible definitions. It will be interesting to correlate responses to these 'knowledge' questions with NHIS data still forthcoming on reported actual smoking and drinking behavior among women respondents who were recently pregnant.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and offspring hyperactivity: Effects of para-chlorophenylalanine and methysergide
A1  - Bond N.W.
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to either a liquid diet containing ethanol, pair-fed an identical diet with sucrose substituted for ethanol, or received ad lib chow and water, during days 6-19 of gestation. Pups were injected with a dose of 100 mg/kg of para-chlorophenylalanine, 48 hr, 24 hr or immediately prior to activity testing at 16, 22 or 28 days of age. Further groups were injected with isotonic saline just prior to activity testing. Pups exposed to alcohol prenatally were more active than controls at 16 days of age. Para-chlorophenylalanine brought about significant increases in activity when injected 24 or 48 hr prior to testing in 16-day-old pups, and significant increases in activity when injected 24 hr prior to testing in 22- and 28-day-old pups. However, these effects of para-chlorophenylalanine were similar regardless of prenatal treatment. In a second study, 16-day-old pups received saline, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg of methysergide immediately prior to an activity test. Methysergide brought about a dose-related decrease in activity in all three groups of pups. Most importantly, the effects on activity of the methysergide were similar regardless of the treatment received during gestation. These data indicate that the hyperactivity associated with fetal alcohol exposure is unlikely to result from alterations in the ontogeny of a serotonergic system involved in response inhibition.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Several questions in the 1985 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Questionnaire, which was part of the 1985 National Health Interview Survey, addressed respondents' consumption of alcohol. Sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of health risks related to heavy drinking, health practices, and the prevalence of certain health conditions were examined in relation to drinking levels. Although cause-effect relationships should not be inferred from the associations, the findings suggest some provocative areas for prevention and research. Heavier drinkers were more commonly found among men than women. Level of drinking was associated positively with years of education and family income, but was inversely related to age. Compared with light drinkers, heavier drinkers were much more likely to drive after they had had too much to drink. While more than 90 percent of the population knew that heavier drinking increases the risk of liver cirrhosis, less than half knew about the increased risk of throat cancer and cancer of the mouth. Most respondents aged 18-44 years (80 percent or more) knew that heavy drinking increases the chance of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and more women than men (62 versus 49 percent) had heard of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, 70 percent or more of those who had heard of FAS described the syndrome as a newborn addicted to alcohol rather than a child born with certain birth defects. Heavier drinkers of both sexes were less likely than others to be nonsmokers, and moderate drinkers were more likely than others to exercise or play sports regularly. Moderate drinkers also tended to have lower lifetime prevalence rates than others for hypertension and heart trouble.

T1  - Significant determinants of susceptibility to alcohol teratogenicity

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Typically, the rate of abusive drinking during pregnancy considerably exceeds the rates of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related birth defects, suggesting that other factors may modify the impact on the developing organism. Data in the literature supporting this susceptibility hypothesis are sparse. In this paper, two studies in different samples, using different analytic strategies to examine susceptibility to different adverse outcomes are presented. Among 176 pregnancies in which lowered birth weight for gestational age was detected as an effect attributable to frequent beer drinking, 27 infants weighted < 2,700 grams and 149 weighed more. Using discriminant analysis to contrast these groups, lowered birth weight for gestational age was associated with black race and lower maternal weight and weight gain. The effects of these factors were additive with that of persistent alcohol exposure; no interactions were detected, but pregnancies with risks in addition to alcohol were more likely to yield growth-retarded infants. In a second study, pregnancies resulting in 25 FAS cases were contrasted with 50 controls. A four-factor model accounted for nearly two-thirds of the explainable variance in the occurrence of FAS. Adjusted for frequency of maternal drinking, chronic alcohol problems and parity, there was a sevenfold increase in risk for FAS among black infants. The findings from both studies are consistent with the susceptibility hypothesis and have potentially important implications for public health and clinical approaches to prevention, as well as for future research.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Acute and chronic intubations of ethanol to pregnant rats produced changes in spontaneous fetal behavior four hours later. Fetuses from mothers in intermediate alcohol groups (4 and 6 g/kg) were substantially less active than controls (0 g/kg), but fetuses from low (2 g/kg) and high (8 g/kg) alcohol groups showed little indication of behavioral suppression. Circulating levels of alcohol in maternal blood, fetal homogenate and amniotic fluid at the time fetuses were observed confirmed that fetuses were exposed to alcohol in utero, but the measured concentrations of alcohol were not predictive of fetal activity. We suggest that some of the developmental consequences of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome may be the consequence of fetal inactivity induced by alcohol in utero.

T1  - Is social drinking during pregnancy harmless?
A1  - Hatfield D.
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - The last 10 to 15 years have provided a growing body of evidence that demonstrates a distinct relationship between excessive alcohol consumption during pregnancy and birth defects. In light of this voluminous quantity of research, no responsible health professional or researcher would deny that alcohol can cause fetal abnormalities if consumed chronically and in large quantities. However, close examination of the literature does not support the no threshold corollary - that is that any amount of alcohol will have a detrimental effect on the fetus. At present, it appears that only those women who consume large amounts of alcohol on a chronic basis are at risk of giving birth to children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and its associated anomalies. Prevention should be aimed at this group of women. Blanket warnings and recommendations for total abstinence may serve little purpose other than to instill unnecessary fear, anxiety and guilt in those women at little or no risk while having no affect on the real target audience; the chronic heavy drinkers.

N2  - A survey was conducted to ascertain the extent to which programs have been undertaken to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and/or fetal alcohol related birth defects. A questionnaire was sent to the public health departments in each state and the District of Columbia. Telephone follow-up interviews were conducted. Data were obtained with respect to the nature and costs of fetal alcohol syndrome (and fetal alcohol effects) prevention programs. Other information was elicited concerning perception of fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects as a health problem. The major conclusion was that, as a whole, state governments have not made a sustained commitment to the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome. There are some instructive exceptions, however. Several states have initiated programs that could serve as a model for a national effort. These data, scant as they are, suggest that a properly focused and balanced prevention program can reduce maternal alcohol consumption.

T1  - Lithium and the neonate: Developmental and metabolic aspects
A1  - Messiha F.S.
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - The interrelationship between lithium salts, which has been used in clinical trials of alcoholism, and ethanol, which evoke fetal alcohol syndrome by chronic use, was studied. This was made by evaluating the effect of prenatal and postnatal exposure to LiCl on ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolizing enzymes in the newborn mouse. The three Li-treatment regimens made consisted of acute and short-term prenatal exposure to LiCl in addition to postnatal exposure until weaning of the neonates. The weaned mice were then kept on water for a subsequent two weeks prior to sacrifice. The effects of LiCl given in drinking fluid, on body weight, selected organ weights, hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and heart lactate dehydrogenase of the offspring were determined. Prenatal and postnatal ingestion of LiCl by the nursing mother resulted in decreased brain weight of offspring from both sexes. Concomitantly, there was a reduction in female but not male kidney weight. A marked decrease in the testis weight also occurred. The Li-treatment induced both neonatal hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase and heart lactate dehydrogenase in both sexes. Conversely, an inhibition of hepatic mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, for the enzyme with the apparent high K(m), was determined in the male offspring. Maternal postnatal ingestion of LiCl decreased brain and spleen weights from corresponding control of neonatal male and female, respectively. This Li-treatment also induced hepatic neonatal alcohol dehydrogenase in both sexes. The results suggest that maternal ingestion of LiCl may interfere in brain development. It appears that the spleen, kidney and the testis are sensitive to Li effects depending on duration of maternal exposure to LiCl and to the neonatal sex. The induction of neonatal hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase concomitant with no changes or inhibition of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase may render them susceptible to alcohol intoxication, particularly to acetaldehyde toxicity.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - The effects of maternal alcohol use on mental development, growth, and dysmorphogenesis was studied in a sample of 1-year-old infants born to elderly primiparous mothers. Alcohol intake was measured using Jessor's AA score and a simple count of maximum number of drinks consumed in one day. Infant cognition was assessed using the Bayley Scale of Mental Development. Alcohol levels prior to during and following pregnancy were obtained. Alcohol intake was greatly reduced during pregnancy, returning to prepregnancy levels following birth. A significant linear relationship between drinking prior to pregnancy and infant mental development was found. The average mental development score of infants whose mothers consumed < 3, 3.3 to 29.7, or > 30 mL (< 0.10, 0.11 to 0.99, or > 1.0 average fluid ounces) of absolute alcohol per day was 115, 108, and 95, respectively. Maximum number of drinks consumed in a day related to physical anomalies. No alcohol measure was significantly correlated with condition at birth, postnatal illness, or growth parameters of height, weight, and head circumference at 1 year. Deficits found were less pronounced than those reported in infants with fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - Experimental studies on lipoprotein metabolism in rats reared with liquid alcohol diet from the fetal life
A1  - Tamura Y.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - Recently numerous reports show deleterious effects of alcohol abuse on pregnant women giving their children a high risk of stillbirth and/or several developmental abnormalities and mental retardation, i.e. the Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). In the present study, the effects of maternal alcohol consumption on lipid metabolism in the litter liver were investigated in rats. These rats showed not only quite less lipid deposition in spite of large amount of alcohol consumption up to adulthood, but also showed increased FFA oxidation in the livers. In addition, increased level of very low density lipoprotein and hypoglucagonemia were found. 40 micrograms/kg of glucagon which is known as an inhibitory factor of apoprotein production in the liver, was injected for 2 weeks into the rat tail vein and resulted in apparent fatty liver and hypolipoproteinemia. Norepinephrine injection (1 mg/kg) caused plasma glucagon to be depressed in the rat as compared with adult alcohol rats. Plasma cyclic AMP response to glucagon was also depressed in these rats. From these results, it is suggested that the deranged glucagon secretion from the pancreas and lowered glucagon-induced cyclic AMP response would relate to the abnormal lipoprotein metabolism in the rat.

N2  - Fetal alcohol effects in 359 infants born to disadvantaged women identified as having a history of alcohol abuse or as controls and who provided reports of alcohol use in pregnancy are being studied in a prospective design. Alcohol abuse was assessed with the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST). Alcohol use (AA/day) was based on short-term recall covering 2-week periods prior to each antenatal visit. A tally of anomalies associated with fetal alcohol syndrome was obtained in a blinded examination of each infant. This tally was significantly related to the MAST classification and, for the MAST+ subjects, the tally was related to first trimester AA/day. Birth weight, length, and head circumferences were negatively correlated with AA/day (entire pregnancy); however, the effect was attenuated and not statistically significant in models with covariate control. It is possible that these measures were near the threshold of effect. Scale scores of the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale and three scale scores of the Graham/Rosenblith Behavioral Examination of the Neonate were unrelated to the MAST classification and to AA/day.

T1  - The effects of alcohol exposure in utero on acetylcholinesterase, Na/K-ATPase and Ca-ATPase activities in six regions of rat brain
A1  - Rudeen P.K.
A1  - Guerri C.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - The neural membrane-bound enzymes, acetylcholinesterase, Na/K-ATPase and Ca-ATPase were examined in six brain areas in perinatal rats at 5, 15 and 25 days of age following alcohol exposure in utero. Female Wistar rats were mated with adult male Wistar rats and maintained on either a liquid diet containing ethanol (5% w/v) or on a control liquid diet for various periods during gestation and the perinatal period. These periods were: before and during gestation only (until birth of the offspring); before and during gestation and following birth; during only a period of gestation and contuining postnatally. Enzyme activity was determined by spectrophotometric methods in the following areas of the brain in each offspring: telencephalon, cerebellum, hippocampus, septal area, preoptic area, and medial basal hypothalamic area. Analysis of the data indicates that alcohol exposure in utero will heterogeneously decrease enzyme activity among the six brain areas when compared to enzyme activity in the same brain areas in animals which were not exposed to alcohol in utero. The activity of the three enzymes were most significantly reduced on day 5 of age, compared to levels in the control animals. Enzyme activity in each brain area was generally most significantly affected in animals exposed to alcohol both pre- and postnatally. The results indicate that fetal alcohol exposure reduces neuronal enzyme activity relative to the period of ethanol exposure in utero; the longer the period of time that alcohol was consumed by the mothers of pre- and postnatally, the greater the effect of alcohol on the enzyme activity. Also maturation of enzyme activity is heterogeneous in the brain areas examined; alcohol exposure in utero affects the development of the enzyme activity differentially in the different areas of the brain.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome in twin pregnancy
A1  - Chasnoff I.J.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - In recent years, it has been realized that some infants of frankly alcoholic mothers escape the stigmata of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and others have only a few of the characteristics. These infants are thought to display fetal alcohol effects (FAE). The controversy regarding the amount of alcohol a woman can safely drink during pregnancy and the effects of timing and individual physiology on producing FAS vs FAE in the infant are important questions which can perhaps be partially answered through examining twin pregnancies and offspring. Data are presented regarding the long-term growth and development of a set of dizygotic twins, one with FAS and one with FAE, delivered to a mother who drank moderate amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. The variation in the degree of abnormality found in dizygotic twins exposed to similar amounts of alcohol at the same time during gestation indicates that differences in fetal susceptibility to ethanol dysmorphogenesis are of prime importance to the expression of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - Zinc deficiency acts as a co-teratogen with alcohol in fetal alcohol syndrome

A1  - Rennert O.M.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - Because alcoholism has adverse effects on zinc nutrition and many pregnant women consume less than the recommended dietary allowances of zinc, we postulated that zinc deficiency acts as a co-teratogen with alcohol in the fetal alcohol syndrome. We compared the effects of alcohol on progeny of pregnant mice fed a zinc-deficient diet compared to those fed a diet with adequate zinc. Pregnant CBA mice (n=66) were fed the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet with 0, 15, or 20% ethanol-derived calories containing 0.3 (low) or 8.5 (high) mug zinc/ml. Dams were sacrificed on day 18 of gestation. Resorptions, malformations, and individual fetal weights were recorded. Analysis of fetuses included assays for zinc, assessment of soft tissue malformations, and alizarin red staining for skeletal malformations. Fetal weights were lower in the groups fed the zinc-deficient diet for each concentration of alcohol (p<0.005). The groups fed the combination of low zinc plus alcohol had 37-52% resorptions, while the animals on the zinc-deficient diet without alcohol or the high zinc diet with alcohol had 0.2% resorptions. Skeletal malformations were related to alcohol concentration but not zinc intake, while external malformations were higher in those maintained on the low zinc-ethanol diet. These results suggest that zinc deficiency potentiated the teratogenic effects of alcohol and that nutritional intervention for alcoholic women during pregnancy might reduce the incidence or severity of fetal alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 1985//
N2  - Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can produce a spectrum of abnormalities in the developing foetus, ranging from minor retardation of growth to the fully developed 'foetal alcohol syndrome'. This syndrome comprises a constellation of physical and mental defects associated with a characteristic facial appearance that is found in children born to chronic alcoholic women. Although it was thought to be extremely rare in the U.K., several case studies have recently appeared in the literature, and its incidence is probably increasing. In moderately drinking pregnant women increased rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and congenital malformation as well as growth retardation have been reported, though some of these findings await confirmation. It is likely also that certain behavioural abnormalities are consequent on maternal alcoholic intake. The major U.K. finding so far is that consumption of more than 100 g alcohol per week in the early stages of pregnancy is associated with reduced birth weight. There is no doubt that alcohol is teratogenic in laboratory animals and that the effects are dose-related. In humans the threshold dose necessary to produce damage to the foetus and the time in pregnancy that alcohol is particularly likely to have deleterious effects have not yet been established. In the present state of knowledge there are difficulties in recommending safe limits. It is obvious that abstinence before and during pregnancy is the safest course, but one drink a day is unlikely to be harmful. Greater efforts are needed to educate women about the dangers of alcohol consumption in pregnancy.

N2  - Forty childen exposed to variable amounts of alcohol in utero and 40 control children were studied. All mothers had been enrolled in an antenatal programme aiming to identify and reduce alcohol use and abuse during pregnancy. Follow-up was at the median age of 22 (18 to 27) months. A significant reduction in intrauterine growth was seen in children born to alcoholic mothers. Three of six children continuously exposed to high amounts of alcohol throughout fetal life showed growth retardation and physical abnormalities characteristic of fetal alcohol exposure, while infants whose mothers had stopped drinking did not suffer these effects. Psychological or behavioural disturbances were found in all but one of 13 children born to alcoholic mothers. The home environment during the first two years did not compensate for the effects of fetal alcohol exposure. Mothers classified as excessive drinkers but not abusers all reduced their alcohol consumption after the first trimester. Their children did not differ from controls with regard to physical development or behaviour but many were retarded in speech and, in addition had a more unstable family background.

More moderate consumption is reported to result in increased rates of spontaneous abortion, still birth and congenital malformation as well as growth retardation. There may be functional deficits in early childhood. In the light of current knowledge abstinence from alcohol before and during pregnancy is advisable.

Y1  - 1984//
N2  - The effects of alcohol on the development of neural function in the auditory pathway of the brainstem have been examined in human neonates and chick embryos. Auditory brainstem evoked responses were recorded in six infants of mothers for whom there was evidence of alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In four of the infants, evoked responses were abnormal, with poorly defined, inconsistent peaks. Neurophysiological and histological studies were done on chick embryos which received a single dose of alcohol early incubation. In most surviving embryos the neuroanatomical arrangement of the auditory nuclei in the brainstem was normal. However, Golgi impregnation revealed abnormalities in the length and structure of the dendrites in nucleus laminaris. Electrically evoked neuronal activity revealed abnormalities of synaptic function and the distribution of nerve terminals. The results indicate that in infants and chick embryos the functional development of the auditory pathway in the brainstem is disrupted by exposure to alcohol. Such early changes in this sensory pathway may contribute to the behavioural and intellectual handicaps associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 1984//
N2  - Fourteen previously reported cases of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) showed anomalies of brain structure varying in severity from microscopic disorganization of tissue structure, or abnormalities in neuronal or glial migration only visible microscopically, to complete or partial agenesis of regions such as the corpus callosum or cerebellum and large neuronal heteropias. The difficulty is illustrated of differentiating this type of damage, lacking in specificity and uniformity, from other syndromes of uncertain aetiology, such as De Lange, DiGeorge and Dubowitz, in at least one of which (DiGeorge syndrome) maternal alcoholism has been implicated. Similar brain damage is also seen in other conditions with known causes. In FAS and syndromes with this type of brain damage, most of the non-CNS features which make the conditions clinically recognizable may well be determined by timing or ancillary factors. Alcohol-related antenatal effects should not be identified to restrictively with FAS but should be considered in any condition of unknown aetiology with disorganization of brain structure and mental retardation.

T1  - Interactions between trace elements and alcohol in rats
A1  - Dreosti I.E.
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - Interactions between ethanol and trace elements are reviewed at two levels. The first concerns the effect of alcohol on the concentration and distribution of certain trace metals in the body; changes are described for copper, iron, manganese, selenium and zinc. The second relates to the possible protection afforded by some trace elements against alcohol-related damage. The significance of maternal zinc to the fetal alcohol syndrome is discussed in the light of evidence that pregnancy outcome in rats after gestational alcoholism is less favourable in zinc-deficient dams than in nutritionally replete animals. Cellular metabolism of ethanol may lead to the generation of damaging superoxide and hydroxyl radicals; several trace elements, notably zinc, manganese, selenium and copper, may function protectively as free radical scavengers and as antioxidants. Evidence is presented of increased lipid peroxidation in zinc-deficient tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats and of enhanced activity of Mn-superoxide dismutase in fetal and adults rats exposed to ethanol.

T1  - Effect of acute doses of ethanol on pre- and postnatal development in the mouse

A1  - Sugathan T.N.
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - Investigators on fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) both clinical and experimental, have generally concentrated attention on chronic alcoholis. In an attempt to elucidate the effects of binge drinking on pre- and postnatal development, single doses of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 ml/g body weight of alcohol solutions (25% v/v of ethanol in saline) were administered intraperitoneally to groups of mice on days 8-12 of gestation. Controls were untreated or starved for 6 h. Fetuses collected on day 18 revealed retardation, fetal mortality and craniofacial and digital malformations. While growth retardation and fetal mortality were dose-dependent, malformations were stage-dependent. The 0.01-ml group exhibited only postaxial polydactyly of the forepaw. The reduction in fetal weight of 0.03-ml groups corresponded well with that of umbilical cord length. Following administration of single doses of 0.01 ml/g of ethanol solution on days 8-12, groups of mice were allowed to deliver. Controls were untreated or pairfed and pair watered. Pups were reared by the respective mothers and their survival and growth were observed till postconception day 71 and thereafter brother/sister matings were carried out. At least one pup in each litter remained extremely stunted and failed to reproduce. No significant differences in mortality, growth rates and reproductive capacity of the rest of the pups were observed. It is concluded that single but heavy doses of ethanol during organogenesis leads to a situation reminiscent of human FAS.

T1  - A semiquantitative score system for epidemiologic studies of fetal alcohol syndrome

Y1  - 1984//
N2  - A total of 464 children of 323 women registered for alcoholism treatment in Budapest, Hungary, were studied in 1977-1979. A complex epidemiologic investigation was carried out using medical, psychological and anthropological data. The data were evaluated on the basis of a semiquantitative diagnostic scoring system for fetal alcohol syndrome. The score distribution curve for 301 children whose mothers imbibed during pregnancy was statistically significantly different from the score distribution curve for 163 children born to alcoholic mothers who remained abstinent during pregnancy and from the curve for a matched control group of 464 children. A significant difference was also found between the score distribution curves for the latter two groups. Twenty-five children of 301 drinkers (8.3%) scored below -30 points and were said to show typical manifestations of the syndrome. All of the mothers in this group imbibed large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. A further 205 children of 464 alcoholic mothers (44.2%) scored between -30 and -10 points and were diagnosed as having an atypical form of the syndrome. Among the 205 children, 168 were the offspring of 301 drinkers (55.8%) and 37 were the offspring of 163 alcoholic females who were abstinent during pregnancy (22.7%). A stepwise discriminant analysis showed the best discriminating variables - in order of entry into the discriminant functions - to be current weight, nose-upper lip distance, behavioral disturbance (irritability), root of the nose, intelligence quotient, and palpebral fissure. The most important cause of fetal alcohol syndrome is the direct toxic effect of alcohol on the fetus.

Y1  - 1984//
N2  - This paper reports the findings of two studies of children born to alcoholic parents. In the first study follow-up examinations were carried out in 30 children suffering from the fetal alcohol syndrome. In comparison with the initial assessment, the children had improved in their overall psychiatric status and psychological functioning at follow-up after 36 months, although some psychiatric features such as hyperactivity showed no significant change. Progress of development was independent of sex, age, social environment and therapeutic measures. In the second study children with either an alcoholic father or mother or two alcoholic parents and normal controls were compared with regard to symptoms, diagnoses, and past case history. All subjects attended the child psychiatric clinic. The heightened psychiatric risk for all children with alcoholic parents was clearly shown by this study. Based on questionnaire data and psychiatric symptom scores, it was not possible to differentiate between children with alcoholic fathers, alcoholic mothers and those with two alcoholic parents. With regard to psychiatric diagnoses there was a tendency to correlate with maternal alcoholism, but both types of disorders occurred with the same frequency among children with two alcoholic parents.

T1  - Drinking amongst pregnant women: Some initial results from a prospective study
A1  - Plant M.L.
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - A review is presented of the characteristics of the foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). It is noted that in its most extreme from the FAS encompasses both physical and mental abnormalities. Some of the initial results are briefly presented from the first two phases of a Scottish prospective study. This relates to the patterns of alcohol use and misuse of 1008 pregnant women. These data indicate that self-reported alcohol consumption was slightly but significantly correlated with previous obstetric problems. In addition, a minority of the study group, due to their levels of alcohol consumption, may run an increased risk of giving birth to abnormal offspring. It is concluded that on the basis of current evidence those planning or experiencing pregnancy should be advised not to drink.

Y1  - 1984//
N2  - The authors report 7 cases of chondrodysplasia punctata in whom maternal alcohol intoxication was found. Most often, it consisted of chronic and confirmed alcoholism, except for the last case, in which an acute intoxication had occurred at about the 4th or 5th week of pregnancy. Clinically, the appearance of the children was evocative of fetal alcohol syndrome, except in the last case when, in contrast, the facial dysmorphy was very typical of chondrodysplasia punctata. The skeletal anomalies preferentially involve the lower limbs, sometimes the sacrum, and in one case, the dorsal spine. Upper limbs are always spared. The maternal hepatic lesions may be responsible for the skeletal impairment, due to their repercussion on the metabolism of vitamin K. This skeletal impairment would then be close to that induced by treatment with warfarin during pregnancy. It is absolutely necessary to X-ray the lower limbs in cases with fetal alcohol syndrome, so as not to overlook associated bone lesions.

Dysmorphology attributed to fetal alcohol syndrome usually follows substantial alcohol abuse by the mother during pregnancy, but the authors know of no reports of similar presentations in infants born to mothers who have abused solvents while pregnant. The authors know of no reports of fetal damage due to toluene or other solvent abuses, but chronic solvent use after birth is reported to cause brain, bone-marrow, liver, and kidney dysfunction.

N2  - Forty married women in a psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of alcoholism were interviewed to obtain details of their pregnancies and outcome of pregnancies with particular reference to spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, deaths, mental handicap and congenital abnormalities. Forty controls matched by age and with a diagnosis of endogenous depression were also interviewed. No significant differences were found in the fertility, outcome of pregnancy or state of the children. The probable reasons for this are discussed briefly and the introduction contains a review of some of the literature on the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

Y1  - 1978//
N2  - Although heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been widely recognized as a serious risk to the exposed fetus, previous studies have not indicated the magnitude of risk in nonalcoholic populations. As part of a larger study of pregnancy and health, 1,529 unselected pregnant women were interviewed during the 5th month of pregnancy regarding alcohol intake during the month preceding recognition of pregnancy and during the first 5 months of pregnancy. AA scores (average ounces of absolute alcohol/day) were obtained on each mother for the two time periods. At the time of delivery, 82 infants born to the heaviest drinking women (AA>1.0 during either time period or other high-risk drinking patterns) were matched with infants born at the same time whose mothers were light drinkers or abstainers. Each pair of infants was referred for clinical evaluation without knowledge of maternal drinking history. Of 163 infants examined, 11 were judged clinically to show signs of prenatal effect of alcohol on growth and morphogenesis. Nine of these 11 had mothers with AA>1.0. Only 2 of these infants were classified as having the fetal alcohol syndrome, and both of their mothers were very heavy drinkers (AA>5.0 pre-recognition of pregnancy). The other 7 infants, who showed lesser alterations of growth and morphogenesis suggestive of fetal alcohol syndrome, were born to women who reported drinking an average of one ounce or more of absolute alcohol per day in the month before recognition of pregnancy, a period which may actually include the earliest weeks of pregnancy. These results indicate that both moderate and heavy levels of alcohol intake during early pregnancy may result in alterations of growth and morphogenesis in the fetus. The relationship of the observed abnormalities of growth and morphogenesis in infancy to future CNS performance is under investigation.

N2  - The relationship of alcohol consumption by a woman during pregnancy and specific dysmorphic features and mental deficiency in her offspring is becoming increasingly well recognized. Neuropathologic studies of the teratogenic effects of alcohol on the human fetus have, to the knowledge, only been undertaken in the two cases under discussion here. The first infant has already been reported in the literature as having the clinical features of fetal alcohol syndrome. The second infant presented clinically with severe hydrocephalus and a profoundly abnormal neurologic status. The brains of these infants show similar, extensive, and unusual defects of neuronal migration.

The finding of this spectrum of abnormalities raises the possibility of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy. The deleterious effects of alcohol on the developing fetus are emphasized. In view of the high prevalence of alcoholism in this country the fetal syndrome must be regarded as a serious and preventable cause of morbidity.

Y1  - 1978//
N2  - The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), though a recent addition to the diagnostic vocabulary, was recognized in the offspring of alcoholic women at least 250 year ago. The pattern of malformations, characteristic of this syndrome, was not recognized until 1973 at which time Dr. Kenneth Jones noted similar abnormalities in children born to alcoholic mothers. More recently he has determined that the FAS is the third leading cause of mental retardation in Seattle, Washington. As other physicians throughout the country become more aware of the characteristics of this syndrome many children will be identified as displaying the FAS and their mothers can be identified as alcohol abusers. These identifications may lead to the prevention of other affected children being born to such women.

Yet in spite of the growing awareness of the clinical manifestations of the fetal alcohol syndrome, recognition has been minimal in many areas where alcoholism rates might suggest a sizable number of affected offspring. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to summarize the clinical features of ethyl alcohol teratogenesis to aid in the early recognition of those affected and to facilitate appropriate family preventive counseling and patient management.

N2  - In 1968 Lemoine et al. and in 1973 Jones and Smith described an association between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and altered growth and development combined with a pattern of malformations in the offspring, now known as the 'fetal alcohol syndrome'. Alcohol consumption has also been associated in adults with an increased incidence of cancer of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus. The authors have seen a child with many of the features of the fetal alcohol syndrome who, at age 13 years, had an adrenal carcinoma.

T1  - The Klippel-Feil anomalad as part of the fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Lowry R.B.
Y1  - 1977//
N2  - A brother and sister are described with malformations and handicaps consistent with both the Klippel-Feil Anomalad and the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The mother was known to be a chronic alcoholic throughout both pregnancies. It is suggested that these anomalies are not purely fortuitous but rather that maternal alcoholism may cause errors in cervical vertebrae segmentation.

T1  - Alcohol and the fetus
A1  - Hanson J.W.
Y1  - 1977//
N2  - Current data clearly point to an association between chronic maternal alcoholism and serious morphological and developmental abnormalities in the fetus. When these abnormalities are severe the condition is recognizable as the fetal alcohol syndrome. However, this represents only the most severe end of a spectrum of abnormalities, some of which may be found in a proportion of infants exposed to lesser amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol is an avoidable hazard for the fetus, but only through increased awareness by the medical community and improved education of the lay public may we hope to control this problem.

N2  - The fetal alcohol syndrome was observed in four girls aged 1 1/2 to 9 1/2 years, two of whom were sisters. Three of the children are older than all others previously described as having this syndrome. The signs consist of a decrease of body length and weight beginning at birth, microcephalus, marked decrease of intelligence and narrowing of the palpebral fissure. Frequently congenital cardiac defects are found and sometimes anomalies of the genitalia and other malformations. Experience so far indicates a causal relationship between considerable alcohol abuse of mothers during pregnancy and intra uterine fetal damage. The prognosis is poor; in severe cases of chronic alcoholism interruption of pregnancy should be seriously considered.
