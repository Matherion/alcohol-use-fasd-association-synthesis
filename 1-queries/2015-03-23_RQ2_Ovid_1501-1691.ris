T1  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behavioral and neuroanatomical components of olfaction
A1  - Barron S.

Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with deficits in odor-associative learning in very young rat pups. One alternative explanation for these findings is that rather than a learning deficit per se, alcohol-exposed pups may display a sensory deficit. The present study was designed to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behavioral and neuroanatomical components involved in olfaction. The subjects in this study were pups exposed to 35% ethanol-derived calorie (EDC) liquid diet from gestation days (CD) 6-20. Two control groups were included, a 0% EDC pair-fed and an ad lib lab chow group. In Experiment 1, respiratory response to a novel odor was examined in pups tested at either 3, 4, or 10 days of age. The 35% EDC offspring clearly detected the odor. Furthermore, there was an apparent alcohol-related developmental delay in respiratory rate as shown by a lower baseline respiratory rate at PN 3 relative to controls which was no longer apparent by PN 4. Experiment 2 examined the volume of two neuroanatomical structures involved in olfaction, the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and the vomeronasal organ (VNO) in 3-day-old pups. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with a decreased volume of the MOB although the VNO was unaffected.

T1  - Moderate maternal and paternal alcohol consumption and the risk of spontaneous abortion

Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Maternal alcoholism can lead to the fetal alcohol syndrome in offspring, but the effect of more moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy remains an issue of concern. Therefore, we analyzed data from a large case-control study of spontaneous abortion (626 cases, 1,300 controls) that ascertained maternal alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy, as well as paternal consumption. Asking when in pregnancy alcohol consumption changed allowed us to calculate a weighted average of the amount consumed weekly during the first trimester. The odds ratio for consumption of seven or more drinks per week was 1.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-3.4] when adjusted for maternal smoking, passive smoking, and maternal age. Data were too sparse to examine higher consumption levels. There was some evidence that cases may have had less opportunity than controls to decrease consumption during their shorter pregnancies, potentially biasing the odds ratio upward. The adjusted odds ratio for any paternal alcohol consumption was 1.2 (CI = 0.93-1.5), with no dose-response effect seen. Among pregnancies in which the mother did not drink, there was no association with paternal drinking.

T1  - Delayed onset of puberty and subtle alterations in GnRH neuronal morphology in female rats exposed prenatally to ethanol
A1  - McGivern R.F.
A1  - Yellon S.M.
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Fetal alcohol exposed (FAE) animals exhibit physiological and behavioral deficits associated with reproduction including alterations in LH secretion and decreased sex behavior. Such deficits led us to examine the morphological characteristics and number of GnRH neurons in female rats prenatally exposed to ethanol. Sprague-Dawley dams (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were administered a fortified liquid diet (Sustacal) containing 35% ethanol derived calories from day 7 through parturition. Controls were pair-fed a similar isocaloric diet containing no ethanol during this period or allowed access to dry food pellets ad lib. Compared to both control groups, puberty was found to be significantly delayed in females that were exposed prenatally to ethanol. The median age of vaginal opening for chow-fed and pair-fed controls was 34-35 days compared to 38-39 days for FAE animals. A subgroup of these females was selected at 44 days of age on the basis of delayed onset of puberty and compared with pair-fed controls for the number and morphology of GnRH- immunoreactive staining (ir) neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and the diagonal band of Broca (DBB), regions which contain the majority of GnRH- IR cells in the rat brain. In both areas, light microscopic study revealed no differences in GnRH-IR cell number, nor were differences detected among the groups in the number of bipolar versus unipolar cells. However, a significant increase was observed in FAE brains compared to controls in the ratio of GnRH-IR neurons with irregular processes compared to smooth cell contours. The findings indicate that the gross morphology and distribution of GnRH-IR neurons in the postnatal rat are unaffected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Subtle differences observed in GnRH-IR cellular morphology may be related to the delayed onset of puberty in FAE females.

T1  - Autism in fetal alcohol syndrome: A report of six cases
A1  - Nanson J.L.
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - This paper reports on six children who all fulfill the criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome and have a history of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy, and who also fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of autism. Their behavior and natural history is compared with eight contrast FAS children, of similar ages and functional levels, who were free of autistic behaviors. The autistic FAS children were all moderately or severely retarded. Autistic behavior has not been commonly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinicians need to be aware of this potential dual diagnosis so that appropriate educational and treatment resources can be employed.

T1  - Effect of prenatal and postnatal exposure to ethanol on rat central nervous system gangliosides and glycosidases
A1  - Prasad V.V.T.S.
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - We investigated the effect of maternal alcohol consumption on cell number, gangliosides and ganglioside catabolizing enzymes in the central nervous system (CNS) of the offspring. Virgin female rats of the Charles Foster strain were given 15% (v/v) ethanol in drinking water one month prior to conception and during gestation and lactation. At 21 days postnatal age, the offspring were sacrificed and the brains were separated into cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem to investigate possible regional variations. Compared to controls, wet weight of cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem, and of spinal cord was decreased in the pups exposed to alcohol. DNA and protein contents were also found to be lowered in all the CNS regions of the pups exposed to alcohol. Conversely, maternal alcohol consumption was found to increase the concentration and the content of total ganglioside N-acetyl- neuraminic (NANA) in CNS of the pups. In addition, alcohol treatment was found to induce alterations in the proportions of individual ganglioside fractions. Interestingly, these alterations are somewhat different than those observed in the neonatal brain and spinal cord of the pups subjected to prenatal alcohol exposure. The alterations in the proportions of ganglioside fractions were shown to be region-specific. Maternal alcohol consumption resulted in decreased activities of sialidase, beta-galactosidase, beta- glucosidase and beta-hexosaminidase. The results suggest that the alcohol- associated increases in ganglioside concentration may be at least partly due to the decreased activities of ganglioside catabolizing enzymes.

N2  - The frequencies of 60 minor physical anomalies and various craniofacial measurements in 52 children with alcohol exposure of various durations in utero were determined and compared with 48 non-exposed healthy children at a mean age of 27 months. Compared with nonexposed children a significantly higher total minor physical anomaly count was observed in those children exposed prenatally to alcohol throughout pregnancy. Binge drinking was not associated with an increased minor physical anomaly count. During the first year of life facial features were judged according to subjective impression: 10 children had typical facial features of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 19 children were judged to have possible fetal alcohol effects on their face. Only six of them fulfilled the strict craniofacial criteria for diagnosis of FAS at the age of 27 months. Our results stress the importance of recognising also the subtle dysmorphic facial features associated with prenatal alcohol exposure: 22 of 29 (76%) of exposed children judged to have typical or possible features of FAS during the first year showed signs of central nervous system dysfunction at the age of 27 months.

N2  - Alcohol is the most frequent and most important teratogenic agent causing mental and physical retardation in childhood. The alcohol fetal syndrome is characterized by pre- and postnatal growth retardation, hypotonia, hyperactivity, microcephalus, mental retardation and typical craniofacial malformations. The latter includes short palpebral fissures, a poorly developed philtrum, thin upper lip vermillion, short mandibles, a flattened midface structure and dysplastic ears. Ophthalmological signs occur in 90% and include epicanthus, ptosis, myopia, optic nerve hypoplasia and tortuous retinal vessels. Microphthalmus, coloboma and Peters' anomaly have also been described. Five children with alcohol embryopathy are presented. The histopathological findings of the enucleated eye of a 6th child with alcohol embryopathy which was sent to us for examination and which revealed an anterior staphyloma with Peters' anomaly is also described. Ophthalmologists should be aware of alcohol in pregnancy as a preventable cause of eye malformation.

N2  - In a prospective study intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (<10. growth percentile at birth) was used as a predictor to diagnose intrauterine alcohol exposure. An interview about maternal alcohol consumption was performed prenatally - when IUGR was diagnosed by ultrasound - or postnatally. The children were followed up to 18 months of age. In 6/47 children we diagnosed various degrees of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome FAS, with only one patient showing a full blown syndrome at birth. 5 patients could not be identified until the pediatric reexamination at the age of 8-18 months. IUGR and a maternal history of even moderate drinking during pregnancy should emphasize the possibility of an intrauterine alcohol damage, even in a normal child at birth.

N2  - Recognition of alcohol-related birth defects is less successful in the neonate than in older children. Clarren et al. (1987) were able to describe the geometry of the FAS face at age 7. To define neonatal facial features of FAS, 3 reference points were used to map 7 frontal and 7 profile landmarks coded as standardized cartesian coordinates. These landmarks were digitized from snapshots of 21 neonates, prospectively diagnosed as FAS blinded for prenatal alcohol exposure, and 76 non-FAS controls. In the controls, race was found to be a significant determinant of landmarks, as expected. Using discriminant analysis and controlling for race, the FAS face was characterized by landmark measurements which correspond to short palpebral fissure, scooping out of the nasal bridge and thin vermilion [F(4,71)-7.8, r sq-30%, p < .01]. Jackknifed sensitivity was 75%, specificity, 79%. These findings suggest that FAS-defining features can be quantified in the neonate via computer-based screening of infants from at-risk pregnancies.

A1  - Little R.E.
A1  - Wendt J.K.
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - The major effects of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy are decreased fetal growth, morphologic abnormalities, and CNS impairment. If all three of these are present, with a characteristic facies in the infant, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is diagnosed. FAS occurs only with heavy or alcoholic drinking. The individual components of the syndrome exhibit a dose-response association with ethanol intake in many, but not all studies. Discrepancies in maternal drinking and pregnancy outcome reflect the myriad difficulties of these investigations. Drinking "before" pregnancy also has been linked to decrements in fetal development, possibly because before pregnancy may include the periconceptional period. However, women who are usually abstainers before pregnancy appear to have infants at higher risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes than women who are light drinkers. Future studies need to construct careful drinking histories to address this and other questions that deal with parents' ethanol use and reproductive health.

N2  - The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth, dysmorphology, and cognitive development at 6 years was examined in children whose mothers had completed a self-administered questionnaire during pregnancy. Drinking patterns prior to pregnancy recognition and indications of problem drinking (IPD) were assessed. Heavier alcohol intake was associated with slower growth in height and head circumference and increased dysmorphology, as evidenced by facial features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and the prevalence of probable/possible fetal alcohol effects (FAE). Indications of problem drinking predicted facial features associated with FAS and cognitive deficits (i.e., lower WPPSI Verbal IQ scores and lower scores on a test of receptive language function, the Token Test). Effects of alcohol consumption on head circumference and of indications of problem drinking on Verbal IQ and Token Test scores remained significant, even after excluding children born to mothers having drinkers (over seven drinks a day) and children with probable/possible FAE. Verbal IQ was an average of 7.1 points (95% confidence interval = 0.01, 14.25) lower among children born to mothers having more than one indication of problem drinking than it was among those born to women having fewer indications; Token Test scores were 4.3 points lower (95% confidence interval = 1.38, 7.24). Although the confidence intervals for these estimates are broad in this small, heterogeneous sample, their magnitude, if confirmed, is significant given that the population standard deviation for Verbal IQ is 15, and that for the Token Test is 5.

N2  - This is an analysis of the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth of the offspring at 18 months of age. In this prospective study, a cohort of women was interviewed at the end of each trimester of pregnancy, at delivery, and at 8 and 18 months. Offspring were examined at each follow-up point. Two drinking scales, average daily volume (ADV) and frequent heavy drinking (FHD), were used to explore the effect of different patterns of drinking. We found significant relationships between both prenatal FHD and ADV and offspring growth at 18 months. A significant and inverse relationship was found between ADV during the second and the third trimesters of pregnancy and weight, height, and head circumference at 18 months. Frequent heavy drinking during all three trimesters predicted a significant decrease in head circumference at 18 months. FHD during the second trimester was significantly related to weight and height at 18 months. Analyses demonstrated that ADV was a better predictor of growth deficits than FHD.

N2  - This report examines the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on size and growth in an urban cohort followed prospectively through early childhood. Indices of prenatal drinking were related to measurements of weight, stature (length), and head circumference obtained at birth and during five subsequent in-home assessments. Small but statistically significant relationships were detected between short-term recall estimates of drinking during pregnancy and weight and length at birth. The strength of these relationships diminished during the preschool assessments. However, estimates of catch-up growth associated with alcohol exposure were not statistically significant. With the exception of a single case with a profile of signs characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome, an adverse effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on head circumference was not indicated.

T1  - The effects of chronic postweaning amphetamine on rats exposed to alcohol in utero: Weight gain and behavior
A1  - Hannigan J.H.
A1  - Pilati M.L.
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Offspring of rats fed alcohol, pair-fed, or fed ad lib control diets during pregnancy were administered a dose of amphetamine (0, 2 or 10 mg/kg) daily from postnatal day 22 (PN22) to PN42. Body weight was measured regularly from PN22 to PN60, and behavior was measured on PN22, PN28, PN36 and PN42. Rats exposed to alcohol in utero weighed less than controls at birth and throughout most of the experiment, despite a significantly accelerated weight gain relative to controls. By PN60, prenatal alcohol-exposed rats weighed the same as pair-fed controls. There were dose-dependent reductions in the rate of weight gain during amphetamine administration. After the daily injections stopped, the high-dose (10-mg/kg) amphetamine groups showed a higher growth rate than the 0-mg/kg and 2-mg/kg groups. There were no interactions between prenatal treatment and dose of amphetamine on body weight gain. Rats exposed to alcohol in utero showed a greater locomotor activation than controls given 2 mg/kg amphetamine. The magnitude of the locomotor activation to this dose of amphetamine decreased equivalently over the four test days for all prenatal treatment groups. Male but not female rats exposed prenatally to alcohol showed an apparent sensitization to 10 mg/kg amphetamine not seen in control rats between PN28 and PN42. There were no group differences in amphetamine-induced stereotypy or SGH-23390-induced catalepsy. The results implied that children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome who may be treated for attentional dysfunction would show different dose-responses for some behavioral effects of CNS stimulants, but not for growth-retarding 'side effects.'

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - A hospital based, comprehensive approach to the prevention of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects that combines clinical assessment, community outreach, and epidemiologic knowledge to attack alcohol-related birth defects is described. The program includes training of clinicians and members of the community, baseline screening of suspected children, and alcohol consumption screening of pregnant women in prenatal clinics. The major, although not exclusive, focus of the program is on tertiary prevention undertaken with women defined as 'high risk' for producing alcohol affected children. Of the 48 women referred to the program at the Tuba City, AZ, Indian Medical Center between January 1988 and July 1989, 39 (81 percent) became participants. Complete followup was possible on 31; 17 of them reported alcohol abstinence in July 1989, 18 months into the program. Of the 29 referred women who were pregnant at the time, 21 agreed to participate; of these, 19 (85.7 percent) were abstinent by the third trimester of pregnancy; 5 voluntarily accepted offers of contraceptive measures after the birth of their child.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure: A continuum of effects
A1  - Day N.L.
A1  - Richardson G.A.
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Studies of alcohol consumption, although somewhat inconsistent, have shown a relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure, growth retardation, and morphologic abnormalities. The inconsistency of the observed effects may be a result of differential exposure, exposure at different times during pregnancy, methodologic problems with identification and measurement, or inadequate control for risk factors that covary with alcohol consumption. There have been too few studies to assess accurately the effect of drinking on development beyond the neonatal period. Some studies have found that infants of heavy drinking mothers are growth-retarded and developmentally delayed throughout the preschool ages. These effects seem to be related to prenatal alcohol exposure in a dose-response manner. While these studies await replication, these findings do parallel those reported for children with FAS and children of alcoholic mothers. Laboratory research has also shown that toxic exposures during pregnancy affect the fetus differentially as the exposure dose increases, beginning with behavioral or central nervous system effects, then growth and morphologic effects. FAS patients are affected in all of these domains with cognitive and behavioral problems, growth retardation, and morphologic abnormalities. Children who have been prenatally exposed to moderate levels of alcohol in the MHPCD sample also show deficits in each of these domains, illustrating a continuum of response. Thus, the consequences of heavy drinking seem to represent the more severe end of a continuum of effects seen in the offspring of alcoholics. Furthermore, although alcohol exposure is the major underlying cause of FAS and FAE, other factors, such as chronicity of use, and the biological effects of alcohol on the mother, may be necessary for the full expression of FAS. There are several issues that warrant further exploration. One issue is the relationship between pregnancy outcome and specific components of alcohol use such as quantity, frequency, and timing of use during pregnancy. The lifestyle factors that accompany these patterns of use, and how they interact with alcohol use, also need to be delineated. More information is also needed regarding the long-term development of alcohol-exposed offspring. In addition, the scope of these investigations should be broadened. The traditional measures of cognitive development should be accompanied by measures of learning disorders, neurobehavioral deficits, and socioemotional development. It is likely that at lower levels of exposure these measures of subtle deficits will be informative.

N2  - In the present work we have analyzed, using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence techniques, the evolution of several cytoskeletal proteins during the development of astrocytes in primary culture. The effect of prenatal exposure to alcohol on these proteins was also evaluated. Microtubular protein alpha-tubulin decreased approximately 47% from 4 to 7 days after which its content remained practically constant. Immunofluorescence studies showed also that the content of alpha-tubulin was greater at day 4 of culture. This increase in fluorescence was coincident with the presence of globular particles which were found in interphase astrocytes and stained with both anti alpha- and anti-beta-tubulin. These structures appeared only in proliferating cells. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin were analyzed as intermediate filament (IF) proteins. GFAP, in cytoskeletal preparations, increased regularly for 14 days followed by a decrease to day 21. In contrast, vimentin showed a progressive increase throughout the entire culture period. Fluorescence studies revealed some differences between the IF distribution patterns of GFAP and vimentin. In astrocytes obtained from rats prenatally exposed to ethanol, decreases in the amounts of all the cytoskeletal proteins studied were found during the entire culture period. In these cells a striking disorganization of cytoskeleton was also observed. The alcohol-induced decrease of GFAP in cultured astrocytes was also found when this protein was studied in preparations from whole brain developed 'in vivo'.

N2  - Spraque-Dawley rats were exposed to ethyl alcohol in utero. The effect of chronic prenatal exposure was examined by giving mature females alcohol in isocaloric liquid diets which served as the sole source of liquid and caloric intake before mating and throughout gestation. Controls consisted of females maintained on laboratory chow or an isocaloric liquid diet minus alcohol before and during gestation. The offspring were sacrificed at 21 days of age (weanlings) and the hearts dissociated enzymatically to give purified cardiac myocytes. The effects of daily acute prenatal alcohol exposure were studied by gastric intubation of alcohol to chow-fed females for the duration of pregnancy. The doses used approximated 4 and 5 shots of 80 proof liquor per day by a person weighing 150 lb. These offspring were sacrificed at 2, 6, and 21 days postnatal and cardiac myocytes prepared as above. Heart weights were determined and cardiac myocytes were analyzed for cell length, volume, cross-sectional area, and percent binucleation. Additionally, nuclear DNA content was measured in all of the 21 day offspring. Statistical analysis of the data showed no significant differences between hearts exposed to prenatal alcohol and nonexposed controls with either regimen with the exception of percent binucleation which was significantly but only slightly higher in the 6-day-old hearts. These findings are discussed in relation to anatomical heart defects found in patients with full fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - Neonatal alcohol exposure alters suckling behavior in neonatal rat pups

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure has been associated with a variety of suckling deficits in both humans and animals. In this study, the effect of neonatal alcohol exposure on suckling performance was examined in 15-day-old rat pups. Neonatal alcohol exposure has been used as a model to study the effects of alcohol exposure during a period equivalent to the human third trimester with respect to brain growth. Subjects were Long-Evans rats which had been artificially reared (AR) and fed through gastrostomy tubes from postnatal day (PN) 4-PN 12. The AR groups included two groups given ethanol doses of 6 g/kg/day or 4 g/kg/day and an isocaloric maltose-dextrin control group. A suckled control group raised by their natural mothers was also included to control for artificial rearing. Fifteen-day-old pups were individually placed with an anesthetized dam for a 1-h videotaped test session. Pups in the 6 g/kg alcohol group took longer to attach to the nipple and spent less time suckling than pups from all other treatment groups. Nipple-shifting behavior was disrupted in all artificially reared groups, but it was most severely affected in the 6 g/kg group. These findings suggest that neonatal alcohol exposure interferes with suckling performance and these altered behaviors may contribute to the postnatal growth deficits that have been reported following alcohol exposure in utero.

T1  - Opioid-dependent behaviors in infant rats: Effects of prenatal exposure to ethanol
A1  - Kehoe P.
A1  - Shoemaker W.
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Pregnant rats were given diets containing either 5% ethanol, an isocaloric (pair-fed) diet, or casein pellets. Offspring were tested at postnatal day 10 for isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations and subsequent stress-induced analgesia. Rats prenatally exposed to ethanol vocalized significantly less in the five minutes during isolation. The opiate, morphine, caused a greater suppression of vocalizations in alcohol-exposed pups compared to controls, while the increased calling normally seen with the opiate antagonist, naltrexone, was attenuated. In a test in which the pup withdraws a paw from a hot plate (48degreeC), prenatal alcohol offspring demonstrated baseline latencies (no isolation) similar to controls but had greatly attenuated responses in their isolation-induced analgesia. Since both vocalization and analgesia responses have been determined to be modulated by the endogenous opioid system, the aberrant responses of the prenatal-ethanol-exposed offspring can be interpreted as failures to respond by opioid release/secretion to appropriate stimuli.

N2  - Alcohol, a potential teratogen, has been suggested as an etiologic agent in attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD), which is often diagnosed in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and in children of alcoholics. We studied attentional and behavioral factors associated with diagnosis of this disorder in children selected from a predominantly low-income, black population who were tested as part of a longitudinal follow-up of children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Sixty-eight children with a mean age of 5 years 10 months, born to three groups of mothers, were assessed. These groups consisted of: a) women who reported not drinking during pregnancy (n = 21), b) women who reported drinking throughout pregnancy (n = 25), and c) women who reported drinking an equivalent amount but who stopped drinking after educational intervention during the second trimester (n = 22). Dimensions assessed included factors related to attention on a computerized task, impulsivity, and the presence of psychiatrically significant internalizing and externalizing behaviors. In addition, free play and mother-child interactions were video-taped, and evidence of overactive and noncompliant behaviors was noted. Hyperactivity and impulsive behavior were not evident. Results indicated that children exposed throughout pregnancy showed deficits in the ability to sustain attention and were more often described by teachers, although not by their mothers, as showing attentional and behavioral problems. Problems in both internalizing and externalizing behaviors also were noted by teachers. However, when current drinking was controlled, only externalizing behaviors remained different by group. Noting the limitations of the present study, implications of these findings are discussed. These include identification of symptoms of ADHD in children of women who abuse alcohol as well as qualitative differences from clinically identified ADHD children.

N2  - Alcohol is a potent teratogen associated with dysmorphology, growth retardation, and neurological damage in children with the full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS); alcohol is also associated with growth retardation and behavioral alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to various dosages. Questions remain about the long-term consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. This study reports on the follow-up of a subsample of 68 children, the majority of whom were low income and black (mean age: 5 years, 10 months) who were first evaluated as neonates. Physical and cognitive outcomes of 25 children of women who drank throughout pregnancy [absolute alcohol (AA)/week: mean = 11.80 oz), even after receiving an educational intervention to stop drinking, were compared with outcomes of children in two contrast groups: a) women (n = 22) who stopped drinking (AA/week: mean = 11.46 oz) in the second trimester after an educational intervention but resumed postpartum; and b) women who did not drink during pregnancy and who drank little postnatally (n = 21). Children were compared for alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), growth (height, weight, and head circumference), and cognitive, academic, and adaptive measures. Neonatal and current physical measures were correlated to determine predictability of neonatal status. When the effects of age and gender were controlled, children in the continued-to-drink group showed significantly more ARBDs and had smaller head circumferences than those in the other two groups. When current drinking reported by caretakers was controlled, the children who were exposed throughout pregnancy also showed significant and consistent deficits in several areas of intellectual functioning including sequential processing (short-term memory and encoding) and overall mental processing. Alcohol-exposed children displayed significant deficits in preacademic skills when compared with children of nondrinkers, with both alcohol groups deficient in premath and reading skills. There were no differences in adaptive behavior at follow-up. These data suggest that alcohol exposure throughout pregnancy is correlated with persistent physical differences as well as identifiable deficits in sequential memory processes and specific academic skills. However, even when alcohol use is limited to the first part of pregnancy, significant deficits in academic skills and growth parameters are measurable.

T1  - Effects of alcohol (ethanol) on the fetus
A1  - Brien J.F.
A1  - Smith G.N.
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Alcohol (ethanol) use during pregnancy can produce a wide spectrum of effects in the developing embryo/fetus that are dependent on the maternal drinking pattern. The effects of chronic ethanol exposure on the developing conceptus are reviewed with primary focus on ethanol teratogenesis, manifesting in the human as the fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects. The effects of acute ethanol exposure on the near-term fetus are described, including suppressed fetal breathing movements, electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity and electrooculographic (EOG) activity. The ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is a very sensitive index of acute exposure of the near-term fetus to ethanol, and appears to involve a direct mechanism of action rather than an indirect mechanism involving suppression of electrocortical activity. This disposition of ethanol and its pharmacologically active proximate metabolite, acetaldehyde, and the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase in the near-term maternal-fetal unit are described, and a pharmacokinetic model is proposed. The effects of short-term ethanol exposure on the near-term fetus include the development of tolerance to the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements, low-voltage ECoG activity and EOG activity. The development of tolerance occurs more rapidly to the latter two fetal biophysical activities. The mechanism of tolerance development appears to be pharmacodynamic (functional) in nature, as there is no increase in the rate of ethanol elimination from the maternal-fetal unit. The role of prostaglandins (PGs) in the mechanism of the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is described. In the near-term fetus, there is a direct relationship between fetal blood ethanol concentration and fetal plasma PGE2 concentration, and an inverse relationship between the incidence of fetal breathing movements and each of fetal plasma and fetal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PGE2 concentrations. Indomethacin, a PG synthetase inhibitor, selectively blocks and reverses the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements. These data support the postulates that the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is mediated by increased PGE2 concentration in the near-term fetus and that the ability of indomethacin to antagonize the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is due to its biochemical action to decrease fetal PGE2 concentration. Current and future research activities are directed towards determining whether the ethanol-induced suppression of fetal breathing movements is due to increased PGE2 concentration in the lower brain stem (lower pons/medulla) of the near-term fetus resulting either from increased local synthesis of PGE2 or from increased PGE2 synthesis at a site(s) outside the central nervous system and consequent transfer of PGE2 from the fetal systemic circulation into the lower brain stem.

T1  - Can methionine and zinc prevent the embryopathic effects of alcohol?
A1  - Seyoum G.G.
A1  - Persaud T.V.N.
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Alcoholism is a major and world-wide health problem. A characteristic pattern of congenital defects, known as the fetal alcohol syndrome, has been detected in the offspring of mothers who are chronic alcoholics .The mechanism underlying the teratogenic effects of ethanol is not known. An important hypothesis is that ethanol becomes teratogenic by inducing maternal/fetal nutritional deficiencies. Nutrients affected by ethanol consumption include methionine and zinc. Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that zinc deficiency is associated with both fetal growth retardation and developmental defects. Furthermore, the ethanol metabolizing enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, is a zinc metalloenzyme. Zinc deficiency decreases alcohol dehydrogenase activity and thus slows down elimination of ethanol. Methionine, an essential amino acid, is a lipotrope, as well as a universal methyl donor. It is involved in hepatic detoxification. Studies on the effects of methionine and zinc might lead to appropriate therapeutic intervention in pregnancies of alcoholic mothers who are at a risk of giving birth to an impaired offspring. Furthermore, the results of such investigations will provide a better understanding of the mechanism of action of ethanol on the embryo.

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on learning in adult offspring were studied in a spatial task in a T-maze. Male and female Long-Evans rats were selected from litters whose dams had received one of three treatments: alcohol in a liquid diet (35% ethanol-derived calories, 35% EDC), pair-fed nutritional control (0% ethanol-derived calories, 0% EDC) or standard control (lab chow, LC). The task included trial-independent (reference memory) and trial-dependent (working memory) components: subjects were required to make a fixed left-right discrimination, and then to alternate left and right choices to escape water. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with a greater number of reference errors for both sexes; only males from the alcohol prenatal treatment group, however, were impaired on the working memory component. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol can cause behavioral dysfunctions that persist into adulthood. Secondly, the pattern of memory impairments suggests that both sexes may be equivalently damaged in neural areas subserving reference memory, but that males are selectively more vulnerable in neural areas subserving working memory.

N2  - The teratogenic effects of drinking during pregnancy on cognitive development were investigated in a cohort of disadvantaged mother-infant pairs. Three indices associated with maternal alcohol use were related to comprehensive cognitive measures obtained during five in-home assessments through age four years, ten months. Birth weight and a tally of craniofacial anomalies were also evaluated as early indicators of fetal alcohol damage. Multiple analyses relating the alcohol and cognitive measures provided no evidence of an adverse alcohol effect on cognitive development in the absence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Assessments based on confidence intervals indicated that an average decrement of more than two points (IQ equivalent) on the five cognitive measures is unlikely for relatively heavy levels of maternal alcohol use or alcohol-related problems. Marginal relationships were observed between cognitive measures and the neonatal indicators, but depended heavily on the influence of a child exhibiting signs consistent with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. This case therefore received special attention. The implications of the relationships involving the neonatal indicators were investigated using arguments based on path analysis.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a disorder that occurs in children of alcoholic mothers and is characterized by typical craniofacial dysmorphia and retardation of mental and physical growth. Semiquantitative evaluation of the most common symptoms permits clinical classification into three stages. Although numerous hypotheses have been suggested, the pathogenetic mechanism is not yet well understood. Prevention through medical advice and counselling still remains the most successful form of therapy. A case of fetal alcohol syndrome caused by excessive maternal drinking accompanied by high nicotine consumption during pregnancy is reported.

T1  - Alcohol and pregnancy. An epidemiologic perspective
A1  - Janerich D.T.
A1  - Taylor Mayne S.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - This article considers maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy, from an epidemiologic perspective. In general, maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy has been associated with a number of effects in offspring including fetal alcohol syndrome, a reduction in birth weight, effects on behavior, and other late effects. It is apparent from the existing literature that the epidemiologic dimensions of these effects are poorly defined and hampered by methodologic problems. Assessment of both outcome and exposure can be difficult, and there is great potential for uncontrolled confounding. Additionally, it is unclear whether the apparent teratogenicity of alcohol results from direct, acute effects of alcohol on the developing fetus, or results from chronic effects of excessive alcohol intake in the mother. This article concludes with recommendations for further research, which may help clarify the complexity of effects associated with maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy.

N2  - The effects of fetal alcohol exposure on language and speech acquisition were investigated in a cohort of socioeconomically disadvantaged urban children. Language development was assessed by instruments derived from the Expressive and Receptive Scales of the Sequenced Inventory of Communication Development (SICD) at 1, 2, and 3 years, and by indices constructed from a taped speech sample at age 2 years. Three indices of maternal drinking were supplemented with birth weight and a tally of craniofacial anomalies as early indicators of fetal alcohol damage. No statistically significant relationships were found between the alcohol and language indices after statistical control for confounding variables. The anomalies tally was marginally related to reduced language scores. The statistical significance of this relationship, depended, however, on a single child with the characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome. The pattern of results suggested that the anomalies tally, and to a lesser extent birth weight, are more sensitive indicators of fetal alcohol exposure than subsequent language development.

T1  - Sex differences in corpus callosum: Influence of prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal undernutrition
A1  - Zimmerberg B.
A1  - Mickus L.A.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - The functional significance of sex differences in the size of the corpus callosum was investigated using a prenatal alcohol exposure paradigm that influences the fetal hormonal milieu. Adult male and female Long-Evans rats were selected from one of 3 prenatal treatment histories: prenatal alcohol-exposed (35% ethanol-derived calories), nutritional control (0% ethanol-derived calories) or standard control (lab chow). Subjects were assessed for open field activity at 85 days of age. At 100 days of age, midline sagittal areas of the corpus callosum and the anterior commissure were determined for these subjects. Male control subjects had significantly larger callosal areas than female controls. Prenatal alcohol exposure significantly decreased the total callosal area, and abolished this sexual dimorphism. When the callosal measurements were analyzed using Denenberg's regions, differential effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, undernutrition and sex were dissociable by subarea. There were no significant sex differences or effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the middle sagittal area of the anterior commissure. Callosal size was negatively correlated to open field activity, suggesting a possible role in normal exploratory behavior and to the overactivity observed after prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - T's and blues (pentazocine and tripelennamine) abuse during pregnancy has been reported to be associated with adverse maternal and fetal effects. In this study, conducted at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, pregnancy outcome and health status of infants born to 23 T's and blues abusers were compared to a group of 100 unexposed women and their infants. Infants born to T's and blues abusers had significantly reduced birthweight, length, head circumference, and an increased frequency of major congenital anomalies (3 of 23), including two congenital cardiac anomalies. However, one of these cardiac anomalies occurred in the offspring of a woman who also reported moderate to heavy daily alcohol use during pregnancy. The other cardiac anomaly occurred in association with in utero anoxia. We therefore surmise that a known teratogen (alcohol) and perinatal complications caused two of the major anomalies, and not the pentazocine-tripelennamine combination per se.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - This longitudinal, prospective, population-based study examined the long-term effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on 482 school aged children. Maternal reports of alcohol use obtained during pregnancy were significantly related to child IQ, achievement test scores, and classroom behaviors in second grade children, even after statistical adjustment for appropriate covariates. Consumption of two drinks per day or more on the average was related to a 7-point decrement in IQ in 7-year-old children even after statistically adjusting for appropriate covariates. Low paternal education and more children in the household were identified as environmental factors exacerbating the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on child IQ. Learning problems were associated with the alcohol 'BINGE' pattern of five or more drinks on at least one occasion. This study shows that alcohol use patterns within the social drinking range can have long lasting effects on IQ and learning problems in young school aged children. These patterns should not be interpreted as biologic thresholds. It should also be noted that these are group effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, not necessarily predictable in the individual child, and that for the most part these children were functioning with the normal range of intelligence.

T1  - The role of acetate in alcohol-induced alterations of uterine glucose metabolism in the mouse during pregnancy
A1  - Simm B.
A1  - Murdoch R.N.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - The acute exposure of mice to ethanol during post-implantation pregnancy has been reported to cause alterations in the levels of several glycolytic intermediates in the uterus, suggesting a possible indirect mechanism of alcohol embryo-toxicity. The present study was undertaken to assess whether the ethanol metabolite, acetate is implicated in this phenomenon. Blood and uterine alcohol concentrations in day 9 - pregnant Quackenbush Swiss mice were maximal 15 minutes after the intraperitoneal injection of ethanol (3.5 g/kg body weight), and fell to almost negligible levels 6 hours later. In response to this treatment, the levels of blood and uterine acetate increased, liver glycogen decreased, plasma glucose increased, and uterine glucose, glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P), fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P), and citrate increased. When acetate was administered to pregnant mice in amounts approximating those generated by exposure to alcohol, the levels of uterine F-6-P and citrate increased while other metabolic parameters remained unaffected. The administration of 4-methylpyrazole to mice subsequently treated with alcohol produced conditions of alcohol exposure in the absence of ethanol-derived acetate and depressed the ethanol-induced rise in uterine G-6-P and citrate. The results support the notion that acetate contributes to the alcohol-induced alterations in metabolism, at least as far as the regulation of uterine citrate and hexose monophosphates are concerned. This, together with stress responses induced by exposure to the acute dose of alcohol, may present mechanisms underlying the fetal alcohol syndrome associated in particular with 'binge' drinking.

T1  - Nipple attachment behavior in rat pups exposed to alcohol in utero
A1  - Rockwood G.A.
A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Two experiments were conducted to further characterize impaired nipple attachment behavior in 5-day-old rats pups exposed to alcolhol prenatally. In Experiment 1, animals were given two different nipple attachment tests. In the pups-on-mother test, which required animals to first locate a nipple, alcolhol-exposed pups displayed longer attachment latencies than controls. Furthermore, more than 50% of these pups failed to attach during testing. In the pups-on-nipple test, in which no search for the nipple was necessary, prenatal alcohol did not reliably affect attachment. To assess the extent to which alcohol-exposed pups utilize an olfactory cue for attachment, in Experiment 2, nipple attachment was observed using the pups-on nipple test before and after olfactory cue removal. Similar to controls, the alcolhol-exposed animals only attached to the normally scented nipples. Therefore, prenatal alcohol exposure impaired nipple search performance in young rats, but not attachment once at the nipple. Moreover, these pups performed like controls in response to olfactory cue manipulation. Possible mechanisms for the poor search behavior are discussed.

N2  - Exposure to alcohol in utero has been associated with long-term immune deficits. In addition, adult mice exposed to alcohol prenatally display altered noradrenergic synaptic transmission selectively in lymphoid organs. This is consistent with the hypothesis that sympathetic neurons play an important role in immunomodulation. The development and maintenance of sympathetic neurons are critically dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF). Furthermore, NGF has been shown to modulate immune responses and NGF receptor expression has been localized to lymphoid organs. The present work examined the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the development and maturation of pre- and postsynaptic sympathetic components, including norepinephrine and beta-adrenoceptors, respectively, as well as the early expression of NGF receptors in lymphoid and other organs of the C57BL/6 mouse. Infant mice that were exposed to alcohol in utero displayed reduced levels of norepinephrine and beta-adrenoceptor density, as well as increased NGF receptor expression in the thymus and spleen, but not the heart. These selective changes may account, in part, for the persistent immune incompetence characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with derangements of reproductive function in women. The mechanism of increased risk for alcohol-related abortions and fetal alcohol syndrome is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine if acute alcohol administration affected gonadal steroid hormone levels after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to normal healthy women. hCG was used to simulate the hormonal milieu during the first trimester of pregnancy. Ten women were studied during the mid-luteal phase (between days 17 and 23) of their menstrual cycle. Plasma estradiol, progesterone and prolactin were measured before and after simultaneous administration of 5000 I.U. of hCG (Profasi) and alcohol or placebo solution under double-blind conditions. There was a significant increase in plasma estradiol (P < .001) and prolactin levels (P < .01) after hCG and alcohol administration but not after hCG and placebo administration. Plasma progesterone increased significantly (P < .001) above base line after hCG and placebo administration but this was not observed after hCG and alcohol administration. Since progesterone is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy, alcohol's attenuation of the expected progesterone response to hCG stimulation could increase the risk of spontaneous abortion. An alcohol-induced increase in estradiol after hCG administration could contribute to risk for fetal dysmorphology during the first trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a disorder that occurs in children of alcoholic mothers and is characterized by typical craniofacial dysmorphia and retardation of mental and physical growth. Semiquantitative evaluation of the most common symptoms permits clinical classification into three stages. Although numerous hypotheses have been suggested, the pathogenetic mechanism is not yet well understood. Prevention through medical advice and counselling still remains the most successful form of therapy. A case of fetal alcohol syndrome caused by excessive maternal drinking accompanied by high nicotine consumption during pregnancy is reported.

T1  - Lower serum thyroxine levels in rats following prenatal exposure to ethanol
A1  - Hannigan J.H.
A1  - Bellisario R.L.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is noted for poor growth, developmental delays, and mental retardation. In animals, prenatal alcohol exposure alters anatomical, physiological, and neurochemical maturation and produces behavioral changes similar to those in children. Since thyroid hormones are critical trophic factors for normal somatic and neural maturation, and since fetal thyroid hormones are profoundly affected by acute maternal ethanol administration, we hypothesized that postnatal effects of prenatal alcohol exposure may be related to abnormal thyroid hormone development. We report here that young rats exposed to alcohol in utero have significantly lower serum total thyroxine (T4) concentrations than normal and pair-fed control rats. The results suggest prenatal ethanol exposure may compromise thyroid development in ways not attributable to undernutrition or developmental delays alone. Lowered total T4 levels may be a teratogenic outcome of prenatal alcohol exposure, which could contribute to impaired growth, altered neural organization, and behavioral dysfunction.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure has been associated with deficits in response inhibition in both human and nonhuman studies. In this study, we investigated the effects of neonatal alcohol exposure on passive avoidance, a task that requires response inhibition. Neonatal alcohol exposure has been used to examine the effects of alcohol during a period of CNS development that is equivalent to the human third trimester 'brain growth spurt'. Subjects were 23-day-old rats that were artificially reared (AR) from gestation day (GD) 26-32 through gastrostomy tubes. The AR groups included two ethanol doses; 6 g/kg and 4 g/kg and an isocaloric control. A sham surgery group was also included. Subjects were tested for acquisition and 24-hr retention of the passive avoidance task. The 6 g/kg females required more trials to reach the criterion during both acquisition and retention relative to all other groups. These findings suggest that neonatal alcohol exposure can produce deficits in response inhibition, but that there may be differential sensitivity across sexes to some of alcohol's effects.

N2  - The concentrations of triglyceride, cholesterol, phospholipids, and proteins in the major lipoprotein fractions (very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], and high-density lipoproteins [HDL] HDL2 and HDL3) were monitored in 20 pregnant women who chronically abused alcohol and in 15 abstinent pregnant women. Five of the alcohol users gave birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Lipoproteins were fractionated by sequential flotation from samples taken at 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 weeks of gestation and 6 to 8 weeks after delivery. In abstinent women, concentrations of VLDL and LDL triglyceride, cholesterol, phospholipids, and proteins increased in late gestation. Concentrations of HDL2-cholesterol, phospholipids, proteins, and total HDL2 were increased during the 16th to 28th weeks, but HDL3 remained unchanged. Alcohol abuse clearly reduced the normal increase in total and LDL-cholesterol, as well as in LDL phospholipids, proteins, and total LDL during the 24th to 40th weeks. LDL changes were most pronounced in alcoholic women who later produced FAS infants. Alcohol abuse also increased HDL3. Furthermore, in alcohol users, the normal increase in VLDL was accentuated, especially so in women with FAS infants, and that of HDL2 was reduced. The significance of the changes found remains obscure, but they may be related to impaired function of the fetoplacental unit.

N2  - In this prospective study of alcohol and other substance use during pregnancy, a cohort of women was interviewed at each trimester of pregnancy and when the offspring were 8 months of age. Data are presented concerning the outcome for 461 infants. A significant relationship was found between alcohol use during pregnancy and the growth and morphology of the offspring at the 8-month follow-up observation. Alcohol use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and continuous use of alcohol throughout pregnancy were significantly related to lower weight, length, and head circumference in the exposed infants at the follow-up observation. A significant increase in the risk of minor physical anomalies and fetal alcohol effects was also predicted by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that exposure to alcohol in utero is associated with altered immune capacity. The mechanisms underlying such abnormalities are not clear. However, the suggestion that reciprocal interactions between the immune and the nervous systems are necessary for a competent immune response may be relevant. This work examined the consequences of prenatal ethanol exposure on cellular immune responses and noradrenergic synaptic transmission in lymphoid organs of the adult C57B1/6 mice. Pregnant mice were fed a liquid diet containing 25% of the calories as ethanol (4.8% w/v) or pair-fed an isocaloric equivalent of this diet throughout gestation, followed by foster-nursing the neonates on normal dams. As young adults, mice exposed to ethanol prenatally displayed immunologic and selective neurochemical changes: (1) depressed ability to produce cellular immune responses, including contact hypersensitivity and a local graft-vs-host response, and (2) altered noradrenergic synaptic transmission, including enhanced norepinephrine turnover, and a reduction in norepinephrine levels and beta-adrenoceptor density in the thymus and spleen, but not the heart. However, both the integrity and compartmentation of noradrenergic nerve fibres in the spleen were intact. It is suggested that altered noradrenergic synaptic transmission selectively in lymphoid organs may contribute to the impaired immune capacity associated with fetal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Preventing alcohol related birth damage: A review
A1  - Waterson E.J.
A1  - Murray-Lyon I.M.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Since 1974 numerous clinical studies have made it clear that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy (in excess of 80 g or 8 units daily) can result in a child being born with a specific combination of physical and mental disabilities know as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. More moderate levels of intake (as little as 10 g of 1 unit daily) are associated with other fetal problems know as Fetal Alcohol Effects. The most common of these is growth retardation. Reduction of alcohol consumption is beneficial to pregnancy outcome. However, despite this great clinical and research interest within the field there has been comparatively little attention paid to researching possible preventative strategies and appropriate policy development. This paper first describes the size of the problem posed by drinking in pregnancy in the U.S.A. and the U.K., detailing the contrasting policy response on either side of the Atlantic. It examines the difficulties of formulating appropriate advice and then assesses the available research reports on preventative measures. The strategies described include general publicity and counselling for pregnant women. In addition, attention has been paid to the problems of dissemination by emphasising professional education. One major shortcoming is that most of these studies appear to have been carried out with little reference to existing knowledge on health education and promotion, or educational work in the antenatal or alcohol fields. In addition, little attention appears to have been paid to the characteristics of the groups at whom intervention might be targeted or the underlying social or psychological factors which maintain drinking in these groups. The second part of this paper, therfore, attempts to suggest appropriate avenues for developing preventative strategies by presenting a wide-ranging review with special reference to British experience. Particular attention is given to the issues of form and content of appropriate message, targeting of risk populations, the venue for intervention, and media and the actual mechanisms involved in implementing the programme. We conclude that women should be advised to limit their alcohol consumption to no more than one unit a day when they are either pregnant or planning a pregnancy. We recommend that pregnant women should be asked about their alcohol and given appropriate advice during routine antenatal clinic visits. We suggest that the form of advice should be designed with the characteristics of the risk population in mind. Information about appropriate levels of alcohol intake and further professional help for those in need should be widely available and from an integral part of the primary health service, as well as the antenatal and family planning clinics in addition to the more specialist alcohol treatment and preventation services already available.

A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Individual sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of functional deficits due to prenatal alcohol exposure. To examine this hypothesis, Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced narcosis, were intubated with either 2.9 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) twice per day on days 7 through 15 of pregnancy. An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line. Offspring were fostered to lactating Rockland-Swiss mice at birth. Males and females from each litter were challenged with an acute dose of ethanol (3.8 g/kg) at 30 days of age. Measures of sleep time duration, waking blood ethanol concentrations (BEC), rectal temperatures, heart rate, and ethanol clearance were obtained to examine whether the acute effects of ethanol are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not differentially affect responses to ethanol challenge within either genotype. Ethanol-induced hypothermia, heart-rate depression, and sleep time did differ between genotypes, with LS more affected than SS mice. Ethanol clearance rates were faster for SS than LS mice. These results suggest postnatal pharmacological responses to acute ethanol challenge are not altered by prenatal alcohol exposure in LS and SS mice. Prenatal alcohol-exposed offspring of both mouse genotypes showed lower average heart rate responses than controls, suggesting this measure may be a sensitive indicator of prenatal alcohol effects in mice.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - In a prospective, blinded study 38 infants of mothers with varying quantities of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy had an EEG at 40 weeks post conceptional age. Bayley Development Tests were administered between 1.5 and 10 months of age. The total power of the EEG during REM sleep was inversely related to subsequent motor development (r = -0.51, F = 13.1, p < 0.0008) whereas the total power of the EEG during quiet sleep was inversely related to subsequent mental development (r = 0.61, F = 24.4, p < 0.0001). In alcohol exposed babies EEG abnormalities were present even in the absence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). In 16 older children born to abstainers or alcoholic mother similar results were obtained. Thus, the power of the EEG during REM and quiet sleep at birth appears to be a sensitive index of alcohol effects on the fetal brain and may be used to predict future motor and mental development.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to ethanol causes learning disabilities and low I.Q. scores. The objective of the present studies was to investigate whether exposure of rats to ethanol in utero, would induce a deficit in spatial memory in adult life. Pregnant rats were fed with an ethanol diet from day 1 of pregnancy till parturition. Control rats were either pair-fed with an isocaloric sucrose diet or were fed with lab-chow ad libitum. On the first day of birth, offspring exposed to ethanol in utero were placed with a control mother fed with lab-chow, while offspring of the lab-chow fed dams were placed with ethanol-treated dams. At 40, 60 and 90 days postnatally, behavioral testing was performed using the Morris swim maze, a test of spatial memory. Results indicated that the offspring exposed to ethanol in utero presented deficits in spatial memory processes. Ethanol did not completely block the learning of the swim maze task but the alcohol-exposed offspring exhibited longer latencies to perform the task, swam longer distances prior to locating and climbing onto the platform, and when the platform was removed, searched for it in all 4 quadrants of the pool. Restricted caloric intake during gestation and maternal behavior in early postnatal life also induced deficits in the performance on the swim maze task. However, these deficits were mild and short-lasting being absent at 60 and 90 days of age. In contrast, the deficits induced by ethanol were more severe and longer-lasting, being present in adult life.

T1  - Developmental delays associated with prenatal alcohol exposure are reversed by thyroid hormone treatment
A1  - Gottesfeld Z.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol in utero has been associated with hypothyroidism and a variety of developmental defects characteristic of thyroid dysfunction. The present work examined whether these abnormalities could be reversed in infant rats treated with thyroid hormones. Subjects were offspring of dams which were on the following diet regimen during gestation: (1) free access to liquid diet containing ethanol (alcohol pups); (2) an equal volume of isocaloric liquid diet (pair-fed pups); or (3) ad libitum control diet (control pups). Neonates from each group were foster-nursed by control dams, and received triidothyronine (T3; 0.1 mg/kg/day; s.c.) or saline treatments on postnatal days 1 to 10. The alcohol neonates displayed reduced serum thyroxine which was restored to normal by postnatal day 14. In addition, these pups showed a delayed appearance of developmental landmarks, including righting reflex, dental eruption, auditory startle response and eye opening. The retarded incisor eruption and eye opening were reversed in alcohol pups by T3 treatments. The present data suggest that at least some of the developmental abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure are attributable to perinatal hypothyroidism and can be restored by early hormone replacement therapy.

Y1  - 1989//
N2  - Consumption of fifteen percent alcohol, during gestation did not cause any decrease in the total calorie or fluid intake of the rats maintained on normal dietary regimen. However, the alcohol consumption by gestating mothers resulted in a decreased contents of both DNA and protein in the CNS of the in utero alcohol exposed pups at birth. DNA content was also found to be less in the undernourished pups compared to the normal pups. On the other hand an increase in the total gangliosides and a decrease in the ganglioside catabolizing enzymes was observed in the brain and spinal cord of alcoholic pups at birth. However undernutrition resulted in a decrease in the content of total gangliosides both in brain and spinal cord. Maternal alcohol consumption and undernutrition had also resulted in an altered proportions of the individual ganglioside fractions.

T1  - Thermoregulatory deficits following prenatal alcohol exposure: Structural correlates
A1  - Zimmerberg B.
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol delays the development of thermoregulation in newborn rats. This study examined two possible physiological correlates of this effect. In the first experiment, the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the availability of brown adipose tissue for nonshivering thermogenesis was investigated in rat pups from birth to weanling age. Male and female pups were chosen from independent litters with one of three prenatal treatment histories: 35% ethanol-derived calories (35% EDC), pair-fed control (0% EDC), or lab-chow control (LC). Prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in decreased body weight from postnatal (PN) day 1 to 20 compared to controls. Similarly, alcohol-exposed subjects had lighter interscapular brown adipose tissue pads than controls. However, the proportion of brown adipose tissue to body weight in alcohol-exposed pups was not different from controls. It appears that thermoregulatory deficits at birth due to prenatal alcohol exposure are not due to decreased substrate availability. In the second experiment, the relative growth rate of the tail compared to the growth rate of the body was measured in male and female pups from the three prenatal treatment groups. Five-day-old rat pups exposed to alcohol prenatally had relatively slower tail growth than control pups. Since tail growth rate has been associated with ambient temperature, these results suggest that alcohol-exposed rat pups may be experiencing transient periods of cold stress in the nest because of their thermoregulatory deficiencies, which, in turn, could have important implications for neural and body growth retardation seen in Alchol Related Birth Defects.

N2  - To investigate the effect of maternal alcohol consumption on the development of the fetal thyroid gland, Sprague-Dawley rats were given 20% ethanol for 4 weeks prior to mating and 30% ethanol throughout gestation. Pair-fed controls received an isocaloric amount of corn starch and chow, with water ad libitum, and ad libitum controls received rat chow and water. On Days 17, 18, 19, and 20 of gestation, the fetuses were weighed and the fetal thyroids were removed for histometric observation. On Days 19 and 20, the fetal thyroids of alcohol-exposed fetuses weighed significantly less than those of the two control groups, but more than the control thyroids 1 day earlier. Maternal alcohol consumption caused a significant decrease in both the follicular cell height and the follicle diameter of the fetal thyroid on all days examined. In the alcohol group on Days 19 and 20 of gestation, the cell height was less than, and the follicle diameter was approximately equal to those in the two controls 2 days earlier. These results indicate that, as a consequence of maternal alcohol consumption, growth of the fetal thyroid gland is retarded, and there are indications of fetal hypothyroidism, as seen from the histometric data. This latter is suggestive of a retarded thyrotropic activity of the fetal pituitary gland.

N2  - This study examined the consequences of alcohol (ethanol) exposure during fetal life on lesion-induced dopaminergic synapse responsiveness (plasticity) in the olfactory tubercle of the adult rat. Normally, in the olfactory tubercle, olfactory bulbectomy elicits alterations in pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic markers, including, respectively, (1) increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity and immunoreactivity, which is associated with dopaminergic axon sprouting, and (2) increased dopaminergic receptor density and potentiated dopamine activation of adenylate cyclase. We have utilized biochemical and quantitative immunocytochemical methodology to examine these synaptic markers in olfactory bulbectomized or sham-operated adult rats. These animals were offspring of dams which were administered one of the following diets during pregnancy: (1) liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories ad libitum; (2) liquid diet containing an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin instead of ethanol, pair-fed; or (3) unaltered liquid diet ad libitum. The results show that prenatal alcohol exposure leads to suppression of the lesion-elicited dopaminergic synapse responsiveness in the olfactory tubercle. There were no significant differences between offspring born to control and pair-fed animals, indicating that the observed abnormalities were not due to alterations in their nutritional status. In conclusion, the present data are a biochemical and quantitative immunocytochemical demonstration of impaired lesion-induced synaptic responsiveness. This renders a new dimension in support of previous evidence indicating that prenatal alcohol exposure leads to altered neuroanatomical, neuroendocrinological and behavioral responsiveness to various challenges. Such impaired synaptic responsiveness may underlie brain functional abnormalities characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is well recognized as a risk factor associated with adverse fetal development. While precise safe or dangerous levels of maternal drinking have not been identified, it is clear that the women who drink most heavily are at the greatest risk. Prevention of alcohol-related birth defects requires development of programs directed to the special needs of addicted women and their families. The nature of addiction suggests that direct interventions focused on changing individual drinking behavior have the best chance of success.

N2  - There are reports that fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with immune deficiency or DiGeorge syndrome. To investigate the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the immune system, we used a mouse model of FAS in which C57BL/6J female mice were fed a complete liquid diet containing 25% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) from gestational day (g.d.) 1 to 18. Thymus cell numbers were markedly reduced in 18-day fetuses exposed to ethanol. Thymocytes from fetuses from the 25% EDC diet group and from pair-fed and ad-libitum control diet groups were compared by flow cytometry for expression of T cell differentiation antigens. The proportions of L3T4- and Lyt-2 positive thymus cells were significantly reduced in alcohol-exposed fetuses compared to controls; however, the number of Thy-1-positive cells did not differ among any of the groups. Six-day old neonates exposed prenatally to ethanol from g.d. 1 to 13 had thymus and spleen T cell populations similar to those of controls in almost all cases, indicating a 'catch-up' of T cell numbers in most animals. Spleen T cell function, assessed by response to Concanavalin A (Con A), or Con A plus T cell growth factors, was somewhat depressed in ethanol-exposed 6-day pups.

Y1  - 1989//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption produces various abnormalities in the offspring, termed fetal alcohol syndrome. We investigated various biochemical modifications occurring in the brain and the liver of pups born to alcohol-consuming rats. The parameters analysed were: superoxide dismutase, a protector against free radicals injury, enolase isoenzymes as markers of nerve cell maturation, glutamine synthetase involved in ammonia detoxification, alcohol and aldehyde deshydrogenases in order to evaluate the contribution of acetaldehyde teratogenicity and ATPase activities involved in ion and neurotransmitter transport. Activities of all these enzymes were decreased in the brain even when alcohol was withdrawn from the mother diet either during pregnancy or lactation. Activities were also decreased in the liver, except enolase and alcohol deshydrogenase activities, which were increased, suggesting possible adaptative events in the presence of alcohol. It seems likely that the multiple alterations observed in experimental fetal alcohol syndrome may be caused by free radicals following decreased superoxide dismutase activity in addition to the toxicity of alcohol and its metabolites.

Y1  - 1989//
N2  - The effects of prenatal exposure to ethanol on an alternation test were examined in adult Long Evans rats from three prenatal treatment groups: prenatal alcohol exposed 35% ethanol-derived calories, 35% EDC), nutritional control (0% ethanol-derived calories, 0% EDC) or standard control (lab chow, LC). Subjects were trained to alternate presses on levers to the left and right of a center food trough. Prenatal treatment did not affect the acquisition of this spatial alternation task. However, during the asymptotic performance phase of the task, subjects prenatally exposed to alcohol received fewer rewards and made more errors compared to the two control groups, which did not differ from each other. Even when test sessions were limited to 10 min, performance deficits in the 35% EDC group persisted. When visual cues were made available above the correct bar in a second experiment, performance deficits in alcohol-exposed subjects were no longer apparent. Marked sex differences were also noted in this task: males received more reinforcements, but also made more errors. Prenatal alcohol exposure may disrupt the normal development of behavioral laterality subserving position preferences, and this disruption may partly explain why performance of some spatial tasks is particularly sensitive to the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - The T-ACE questions: Practical prenatal detection of risk-drinking

Y1  - 1989//
N2  - Heavy metal alcohol intake is a major perinatal risk but, unfortunately, is difficult for obstetricians and gynecologists to detect. To develop a brief questionnaire appropriate for office detection of 'risk-drinking', that is, alcohol intake potentially sufficient to damage the fetus, defined here as >1 ounce of absolute alcohol per day, we obtained a quantitative drinking history at the first prenatal visit from 971 consecutive gravid women who admitted ever having drunk alcohol. In addition, we administered the 25-question Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test and the four CAGE questions (C = cut down, A = annoyed, G = guilt, E = eye opener), a screening test previously unstudied in pregnancy, and sought evidence of tolerance to the inebriating effect of alcohol, a question which does not appear to trigger psychologic denial. The patient was considered tolerant if it took >2 drinks to make her feel 'high'. Among 42 (4.3%) risk-drinkers and 929 women who did not report drinking at risk levels, four questions were found to contribute to reliably differentiating risk-drinkers from non-risk-drinkers (R2 = 14.6%, p < 0.0001). The probability of risk-drinking increased from 1.5% for those responding negatively to 62.7% for those responding positively to all four questions (T = tolerance, A = annoyed, C = cut down, E = eye-opener; odds ratio = 109X). A simple scoring scheme (2 points for T and 1 each for A, C, or E, with a total score of >2 considered positive) correctly identified 69% of the risk-drinkers (sensitivity) with a positive predictive value of 23%). The T-ACE questions take about 1 minute to ask and represent the first validated sensitive screen for risk-drinking appropriate for routine use in obstetric-gynecologic practice. If validated in further samples, broad application might contribute to better risk identification, secondary prevention efforts, and improved pregnancy outcomes for offspring at risk from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Drinking and smoking patterns amongst women attending an antenatal clinic - I. Before pregnancy
A1  - Waterson E.J.
A1  - Murray-Lyon I.M.
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - This paper provides basic epidemiological data on smoking and drinking patterns before pregnancy amongst 1117 pregnant women attending a London antenatal clinic. Similar data are already available from North America and surveys have been done in Scotland but there is a dearth of information from England and Wales. In the early stages of pregnancy, prior to recognition, heavy alcohol consumption (in excess of 56 units of alcohol per week) is associated with the Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. More moderate levels of intake (as little as 10 units of alcohol per week) have been associated with Foetal Alcohol Effects such as growth retardation. In our sample 19% of the mothers were drinking more than 10 units of alcohol per week. Six per cent were consuming more than the 14 units of alcohol currently recommended by three of the medical Royal Colleges as 'safe' for non-pregant women. Average weekly alcohol consumption was related to both the usual frequency and amount drunk, but also to binge drinking, beverage choice and combination, and reasons for drinking. In general, drinking was frequent and light. Those women who drank more per week tended to drink more frequently than those in the lower weekly consumption bands. Fourteen per cent of the sample admitted to binge drinking (more than 14 units of alcohol in a single sitting). Wine was the most popular beverage type. The range of beverages consumed was wider in the higher alcohol consumption bands. Those in the lower bands were more likely to drink only one beverage type. Social reasons for drinking were of far greater importance than reasons which emphasised the effects of drinking. However, heavy drinkers were unlikely to drink solely for social reasons. Seventy-seven per cent of the mothers were non-smokers, but the incidence of smoking increasesd in the higher alcohol consumption bands. The demographic characteristics of the smokers were in marked contrast to those of the heavier drinkers. Smokers tended to be younger, of lower social status and multiparous, whereas the heavier drinkers were more likely to be older, of higher social status and primiparous. This finding is of fundamental importance to those interested in planning screening or intervention programmes.

T1  - Sexually dimorphic behavioral and brain asymmetries in neonatal rats: Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Zimmerberg B.
A1  - Reuter J.M.
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - Behavioral and neuroanatomical asymmetries were assessed in 3-day-old male and female rat pups chosen from litters whose dams had received one of 3 prenatal treatments: 35% ethanol-derived calories, pair-fed control, or lab chow control. Behavioral laterality was assessed by observing the preferred tail bias on postnatal (PN) day 1. On PN day 3, brains were sectioned and morphometric analyses conducted for total brain volume, left and right neocortical volumes, and left and right hippocampal volumes. Prenatal alcohol exposure altered the population proportions of left, righ and neutral tail biases in male pups on PN day 1. Female pups were affected by both prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal undernutrition/stress of pair-feeding. Prenatal alcohol exposure decreased body weight and total brain volume, but increased the brain volume/body weight ratio compared to both control groups. Prenatal alcohol exposure also reduced the volumes of the hippocampus and neocortex, with the greatest proportional reduction found in the volume of the anterior neocortex. A left-right anterior neocortical asymmetry was observed, with tail bias, prenatal treatment and sex all significant factors. Alcohol-exposed males showed a 'feminized' asymmetry. These results demonstrate that a sexually dimorphic cerebral asymmetry can be detected at birth in rats; this asymmetry appears to be related to a postural position bias. The reversal of normal interhemisphere relations by prenatal alcohol exposure in male offspring suggested that the in utero hormonal milieu modulates the developmental of cerebral lateralization.

T1  - Commissural size in neonatal rats: Effects of sex and prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Zimmerberg B.
A1  - Scalzi L.V.
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - Sex differences have been reported in the size of the adult corpus callosum in both humans and rodents. This experiment investigated whether sex and/or different prenatal treatment conditions would influence commissural size at birth. Male and female 3-day-old Long Evans rats were selected from one of three prenatal treatment histories: prenatal alcohol-exposed (35% ethanol-derived calories, 35% EDC), nutritional control (0% ethanol-derived calories, 0% EDC) or standard control (lab chow). Midline sagittal areas of the corpus callosum and the anterior commissure were determined for these subjects. Male control subjects had significantly larger callosal areas than females. Prenatal alcohol exposure significantly abolished this sexual dimorphism, with 35% EDC males having a significantly smaller callosal area than males from both control groups. This effect was independent of prenatal treatment differences in body or brain size. There were no significant sex differences in the midline sagittal area of the anterior commissure, nor were there any apparent effects of prenatal treatment on this measure. These results indicate that sex differences in the size of the corpus callosum are present at birth. Since a difference in myelination cannot account for this difference in area, there may be a sex difference in the number of fibers or in the average fiber size. Additionally, the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on male, but not female, offspring suggest that this alcohol-related birth defect is hormonally mediated.

N2  - As a model of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) the rate of the maturation of the functions of the central nervous system was studied in the offspring of pregnant CFY rats receiving (from the 7th-15th day of gestation) either oral ethanol treatment or liquid diet containing ethanol. Both types of exposure caused numerous behavioural impairments, besides high perinatal mortality also the opening of the eyes and ears, and the appearance of postural reflexes were delayed. The newborn rats could be characterized by hyperactivity and weak motor coordination. The learning capacity, the avoidance conditioned reflexes was the poorest in the case of the offspring of mothers kept on liquid diet, containing alcohol, the latency of the conditioned response was significantly lenghtened. During reconditioning, in the case of the sexually already mature pups, the weakest performance was observed in the offspring of mothers having received oral alcohol treatment. This findings indicated, on one hand, that the retardation ceased and, on the other, that the learning and memory impairments caused by oral alcohol exposure was persistent. Following prenatal alcohol exposure carried out by different methods the neurotoxic effect, the retardation of the rate of maturation of the central nervous functions, and the adaptive mechanisms were all affected to different extent. Besides alcohol exposure also other factors (relative protein insufficiency, malnutrition) may be involved in the pathomechanism of the above mentioned phenomena.

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Long-Evans rat dams were treated with ethanol (4 g/kg, twice daily) by gavage on gestational days 10-14. This dosage schedule has been shown to produce significant behavioral and ponderal teratogenicity. Pair-fed dams were gavaged with isocaloric amounts of sucrose. All offspring were reared by untreated, surrogate dams. Pups were sacrificed on days 3 and 28, and whole brain neuronal plasma membranes were prepared for analysis by a fluorescence polarization technique using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as the membrane probe. On day 3, steady-state anisotropy was significantly decreased in the ethanol-treated pups. Arrhenius plots revealed that this difference was associated with a change on both membrane entropy and enthalpy. By day 28, the differences between groups disappeared. These data would be consistent with the view that the brief gestational ethanol exposure delays neuronal maturation.

N2  - Alcohol was administered to pregnant females via a liquid diet that contained either 35% ethanol-derived calories (35% EDC) or 0% EDC on gestation days 6-20. An ad lib lab chow group (LC) was also included. In Experiment 1, odor-aversion learning was examined in 10-day-old offspring. While both the 0% EDC and LC groups displayed odor aversions, the 35% EDC offspring did not. In Experiment 2, learning was assessed in an appetitive paradigm in three-day-old offspring. Once again, the 35% EDC offspring showed no evidence of learning. Experiment 3 examined odor-aversion learning in adults. Both alcohol-exposed offspring and controls learned the odor association equally well. These findings suggest that odor associative learning is a sensitive indicator for alcohol-related learning deficits in rat pups although these deficits may dissipate as the offspring matures. Since odor associations play a critical role in neonatal behaviors, these deficits may help explain other behavioral anomalies noted following prenatal alcohol exposure.

A1  - Handa R.J.
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure has been shown to produce long-term feminizing and demasculinizing effects on male rat behaviors which are organizationally dependent upon perinatal androgen levels. Such exposure has previously been shown to suppress the normal surge of testosterone during the critical prenatal period. Since defeminization of male rate behavior is dependent upon estrogen derived from the aromatization of testosterone in brain, brain aromatase activity was measured during the perinatal period in males and females exposed to alcohol beginning on Day 14 of gestation. Aromatase activity was measured in whole hypothalamus of fetuses from Day 16 through 20 of gestation and in the hypothalamic preoptic area and amygdala of animals 6-12 hr postparturition. Hypothalamic aromatase activity was elevated in fetal alcohol exposed males compared to controls on Days 18 and 19 of gestation and on postnatal Day 1. No effect of prenatal alcohol exposure was found in females. A sex effect in aromatase activity in the amygdala was evident on Day 1 when activity was found to be greater in males than females. Overall, these findings indicate that fetal alcohol exposure will elevate regional brain aromatase activity in males, but not females during the perinatal period of neurobehavioral sexual differentiation.

T1  - Alcohol-related birth defects: An update
A1  - Warren K.R.
A1  - Bast R.J.
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Historically, mankind has at least suspected that alcohol was somehow connected with undesirable effects on progeny. In the 18th century, physicians became aware that maternal alcohol consumption resulted in excess fetal and neonatal mortality, low birth weight, and many other deleterious effects. Perhaps as a response to the temperance and Prohibition periods, scientists lost sight of or interest in the effects of alcohol in pregnancy. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the issue surfaced again, and scientists began systematic and in-depth studies of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Epidemiologic research now suggests that FAS has outranked Down's syndorme and spina bifida in prevalence and is now the leading known cause of mental retardation. Further, it is the only one of these three that is preventable. Because a safe limit of alcohol consumption in pregnancy is not defined, abstinence during pregnancy is the most prudent preventive measure. Factors such as race, beer drinking, maternal weight gain, and low socioeconomic status are associated with a statistical increase in the incidence of FAS. In families where one child has been diagnosed as having FAS, the incidence rate can be as much as 405-fold higher than the worldwide average. Neurobehavioral deficits can occur in the offspring of drinking mothers in the absence of a diagnosis of full FAS. The deficits differ with age and seem to persist into adulthood. Mental retardation or borderline mental retardation is a nearly ubiquitous neurological deficit in diagnosed FAS. In one study, it occurred in 75 percent of the non-FAS offspring of mothers who continued to drink heavily throughout their pregnancy. From the mid-1970s, having established that alcohol is a teratogen, scientists have been trying to uncover the mechanism by which alcohol exerts its embryotoxic effects. Recent promising neuroanatomical studies have demonstrated that alcohol has a deleterious effect on neuronal migration and hence on the development of the cerebral cortex. Other studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure, by adversely affecting hippocampal development, may be responsible for the learning deficits so frequently encountered in FAS children. Other research has implicated prostaglandins in the mechanism of alcohol-related dysmorphology.

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Present data on the harmful fetal effects of maternal alcohol use have seriously questioned the safety of ethanol treatment, as once prescribed for arresting premature uterine contractions. Therefore, we analyzed retrospectively the fate of infants whose mothers took ethanol for threatened first-or second-trimester abortion in 1968-1973. One hundred thirty-six patients were given an average of 38 g of ethanol (10-120 g) per day for two to 34 days, whereas 103 comparable patients received no ethanol treatment. The immediate and long-term effects on each woman's offspring were followed from birth to age 14. No infant had typical fetal alcohol effects. Fetal growth and the rates of fetal/neonatal deaths and anomalies were similar in both groups. Furthermore, there was no difference in postnatal growth and development. Thus, ethanol treatment as once prescribed for threatened abortion evidently did not cause fetal damage.

T1  - Alcohol counselling of 85 pregnant problem drinkers: Effect on drinking and fetal outcome
A1  - Halmesmaki E.
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Eighty-five pregnant problem drinkers were given intensive counselling throughout gestation to persuade them to reduce or stop their alcohol intake. Nevertheless, 7% of their blood specimens collected at follow-up visits contained ethanol. Fifty-five women (65%) were able to reduce their alcohol consumption by at least 50%. Alcohol abuse was associated in a dose-dependent manner with fetal growth retardation detectable by ultrasonography from 27 weeks gestation. Twenty infants (24%) had a complete fetal alcohol syndrome and 22 (26%) had some features of 'fetal alcohol effects' (FAE). In addition, the rate of structural malformations was high (13%). Of the women with continuous alcohol abuse 89% gave birth to infants with at least one feature of FAE compared with only 49% of those who decreased their alcohol consumption.

N2  - Studies of alcohol-related birth defects in humans rely heavily on maternal self-reports of alcohol use. The accuracy of self-reports, and thus of related risk levels, is of concern to investigators, to public health professionals, and to persons advising pregnant women. We contrasted quantitative reports of drinking in pregnancy by 238 women with retrospective reports obtained 5 years later. Alhough correlated (r = 0.67, p < 0.0001), marked discrepancies suggested underreporting during pregnancy by a significant proportion of the women. The validity of the retrospective index was indicated in that it was somewhat more highly related to scores on the Michigan Alcholism Screening Test (MAST) and to a tally of alcohol-related craniofacial anomalies in the neonate than was the in-pregnancy index. Furthermore, the retrospective index and the MAST score were significant predictors of other neonatal anomalies; the in-pregnancy index was not. The only variable related to underreporting was MAST score, i.e., the higher the MAST score the greater the underreporting. The results suggest that previously reported thresholds of effect based on self-report data may be underestimates. The results also suggest that questions regarding alcohol-related problems may be more effective than direct consumption questions in the identification of women who drink heavily in pregnancy.

A1  - Blanchard B.A.

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Shuttle avoidance performance following pretreatment with physostigmine was assessed in 85- to 100-day-old rats whose mothers consumed a liquid diet consisting of 35% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) during pregnancy. Offspring of pair-fed (0% EDC) and ad lib lab chow (LC) dams served as controls. Animals received either 0, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg physostigmine sulfate prior to acquisition training in a shuttle avoidance apparatus. Training consisted of 50 trials/day for 4 days. Thirty-five percent EDC rats made fewer avoidances than controls during acquisition training. Treatment with physostigmine reduced the number of avoidances made, and did so similarly for all prenatal treatment groups. Escape latencies were not affected by prenatal treatment, although they were increased by physostigmine administration prior to training. Neither prenatal treatment nor physostigmine treatment affected activity as measured by the number of intertrial crossings while in the apparatus. These data indicate that alcohol-exposed animals did not respond differentially to physostigmine relative to controls, suggesting that cholinergic dysfunction may not underlie the prenatal alcohol-induced deficit in active avoidance.

N2  - The effect of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and lactation on -aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in different rat brain regions of 3-week-old pups was investigated. There was a significant decrease in the thalamus, pons, cerebellum and hippocampus, no change in posterior colliculus, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, hypothalamus, septum or striatum and a significant increase in frontal cortex, olfactory bulbs, anterior colliculus and amygdala. These modifications could be a consequence of alterations in membrane permeability and may be related to the behavioural disorders associated with the fetal-alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Maternal ingestion of alcohol appears to cause a pattern of congenital anomalies with a reduction of pre- and postnatal growth in the offspring. In order to study the possible implication of thyroid function in the effects of pre- and/or postnatal exposure to alcohol, we have studied serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels in rats from alcohol-fed mothers during the postnatal period (0-50 days). Blood alcohol levels of ethanol-treated pregnant rats were  20-25 mM and their serum T4 levels were decreased, compared with the pair-fed controls, at 15 and 21 days of gestation. No significant changes were observed in T3 levels. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with a decrease in both T4 and T3 levels in pups at birth. Although T4 levels continued reduced in the 40-50 days of the postnatal period, no clear effects were observed on T3 levels during this time. Moreover, the more marked alterations were obtained when the offspring were postnatally and pre+postnatally exposed to alcohol. Significant decreases were found in both T4 and T3 levels following postnatal exposure, except at the 20-25th day when a marked but transient increase in T4 cells was observed. These results indicate that alcohol exposure disturbs the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis, as measured by T3 and T4 hormone levels, mainly when the rats are exposed during the postnatal period.

N2  - Two groups of 4-year-old children were examined by a dysmorphologist without knowledge of previous examination results or prenatal exposure and categorized as to whether or not they showed fetal alcohol effects. A priori classification of children into the two groups was on the basis of their mothers' self-report of drinking when interviewed during pregnancy. Children born to 108 mothers in a 'heavier' drinking group (absolute alcohol concentration >30 mL/d [1.0 oz/d]) were compared with a matched group of children born to 97 mothers whose average absolute alcohol concentration was <0.3 mL/d (0.01 oz/d). The percentage of children with fetal alcohol effects in the heavier drinking v the comparison group was 20.4% v 9.3%. When fetal alcohol effects were studied in relation to only the absolute alcohol concentration scores, there was a significantly greater chance of a child being classified as having fetal alcohol effects with increasing levels of alcohol exposure prior to recognition of pregnancy (P = .013). A logistic regression, run on the absolute alcohol concentration scores and other primary exposures, indicated that fetal alcohol effects classification was not significantly related to nicotine, or marijuana but was significantly related to absolute alcohol concentration scores even after statistically adjusting for these other exposures (P = .002). Classification of fetal alcohol effects at 4 years of age was compared to a fetal alcohol effects classification obtained at birth by an independent dysmorphologist in a sample of 75 subjects examined at both ages, and 80% of the infants classified as having fetal alcohol effects at birth were classified as having fetal alcohol effects at 4 years of age. These findings have important implications in terms of evaluations of alcohol-exposed infants at various ages.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters behavioral laterality of adult offspring in rats
A1  - Zimmerberg B.
A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - The effects of prenatal exposure to ethanol on side preference behavior were examined in adult Long Evans rats from three prenatal treatment groups: prenatal alcohol exposed (35% ethanol-derived calories, 35% EDC), nutritional control (0% ethanol-derived calories, 0% EDC) or standard control (lab chow, LC). Rats prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibited less side preference in a two-lever operant chamber while responding for food reward and alternated between the left and right levers more than either control group, which did not differ from each other. Although side preference increased over days of testing in the control groups, the 35% EDC subjects's side preference did not change with increased experience. When responding on a nonrewarded schedule (extinction), the three prenatal treatment groups did not differ in side preference. Alcohol-exposed offspring also displayed a marked difference in paw use compared to control subjects: while most of the control subjects used one paw preferentially, 35% EDC subjects used both paws together or alternated paws. Prenatal alcohol exposure appears to alter the normal development of behavioral laterality, and this altered development persists into adulthood. Prenatal alcohol exposure may also alter the functional interaction between intrinsic laterality and reward contingencies.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and offspring hyperactivity: Effects of physostigmine and neostigmine
A1  - Bond N.W.
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Rats were fed a liquid diet containing ethanol from days 6-19 of gestation. Controls were pair-fed the same diet with sucrose substituted for ethanol, or received ad lib chow and water. The activity of the offspring was observed at 10, 16, 22 or 28 days-of-age. Overall, offspring exposed to alcohol prenatally were hyperactive compared to controls at 16 and 22 days, but not at 10 or 28 days. Administration of physostigmine had no effect on the activity of any group at 10 days. At 16 days, physostigmine enhanced the activity of the alcohol group, had no effect on the sucrose group, but depressed the activity of the chow group. At 22 days it led to a dose-related decrease in activity in controls but had no effect on the activity of the alcohol treated pups. At 28 days, physostigmine decreased the activity of all three groups. Administration of the quaternary derivative, neostigmine, indicated that the effects of scopolamine at 22 days were probably central in origin. These data indicate that a putative cholinergic/inhibitory system becomes functional in control pups before 22 days, but in pups exposed to alcohol prenatally development is delayed by a number of days.

T1  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area of the hypothalamus in male and female rats
A1  - Barron S.
A1  - Tieman S.B.
A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce a variety of behavioral and physiological alterations, including changes in sexually dimorphic behaviors. It has been proposed that alcohol alters these behaviors by altering prenatal androgen and/or other steroid levels. This study was designed to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on a sexually dimorphic neuroanatomical structure, namely, the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (SDN-POA). This nucleus is larger in males than females and is sensitive to perinatal sex steroid exposure. The SDN-POA was examined in 70-80-day-old male and female rats whose mothers received on days 6-20 of pregnancy either a liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) or a 0% EDC isocaloric pair-fed liquid diet. An ad libitum lab chow control group was also included (LC). Both volume and average cell size of the SDN-POA were markedly smaller in alcohol-exposed males relative to 0% EDC and LC controls. In contrast, prenatal alcohol exposure did not appear to affect SDN-POA volume or cell size in females. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not significantly alter the volume of a nearby nucleus, the nucleus of the anterior commissure, in either sex. These findings support the hypothesis that prenatal alcohol exposure alters sexual differentiation in males, perhaps by altering some aspect of the prenatal androgen environment. The absence of any effect in 35% EDC females suggests that males and females may be differentially sensitive to alcohol's effects on this nucleus.

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - Long-Evans rat dams were treated with ethanol (4 g/kg, twice daily) by gavage on gestational days 10-14. This dosage schedule has been shown to produce significant behavioral and ponderal teratogenicity. Pair-fed dams were gavaged with isocaloric amounts of sucrose. All offspring were reared by untreated, surrogate dams. Pups were sacrificed on days 3 and 28, and whole brain neuronal plasma membranes were prepared for analysis by a fluorescence polarization technique using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as the membrane probe. On day 3, steady-state anisotrophy was significantly decreased in the ethanol-treated pups. Arrhenius plots revealed that this difference was associated with a change on both membrane entropy and enthalpy. By day 28, the differences between groups disappeared. These data would be consistent with the view that the brief gestational ethanol exposure delays neuronal maturation.

N2  - A congenital alcoholic syndrome (CAS) belongs to rarely diagnosed embryopathies . It consists of polysymptomatic misdevelopings in numerous organs of the fetus caused by alcoholic abuse through the mother during the pregnancy. The diagnosis of the CAS is established on the basis of following topics: the anamnesis confirming the chronic alcoholism of baby's mother, the excluding of congenital genetic defects and intrauterine infections as well as qualitative and quantitative feeding deficits. In the differential diagnosis should be taken congenital cranial and facial dysmorphies which are most often seen in many syndromes such as: Pierre-Robin, Treacher-Collins, Weyer , Franceschetti - Zwahlen . In the presented paper there is described one case of the CAS observed during 15 months clinically and radiologically.

N2  - In contrast to the well-known picture of the 'fetal alcohol syndrome' (FAS), clinical symptoms of the incomplete FAS are less frequently recognized compared to the high incidence of the syndrome as stated in the literature. The diagnostic problem is a clear differentiation between mild forms of the incomplete FAS and clinical normality. Post-natal growth deficiency and microcephaly of unknown aetiology, clinical symptoms of hyperactivity, learning disabilities or mild mental retardation are the main features of the incomplete FAS. The diagnosis is established only by a positive history of maternal alcohol abuse.

Y1  - 1983//
N2  - Changes in the drinking and smoking habits of pregnant women in Seattle, Washington, were examined in the 6-year period that followed the first American announcement of the fetal alcohol syndrome. Between 1974/1975 and 1980/1981, the number of women who reported any alcohol use around the time of the first prenatal visit dropped from 81% to 42%, whereas the number of smokers dropped from 25% to 22%; binge and heavier drinking also declined. However, among drinkers, there was no decrease in the proportion of women who reported heavier drinking. Although the proportion of women who drink during pregnancy has decreased in the past 6 years, the relative constancy in the proportion of 'heavier' drinkers and binge drinkers, particularly around the time of conception, suggests the need for more attention to this important period of gestation in advice to women who are planning a pregnancy. Possible reasons for such changes in this particular community are discussed.

T1  - Prenatal loss in the rat following moderate consumption of alcohol incorporated in a liquid diet
A1  - Persaud T.V.N.
Y1  - 1983//
N2  - The teratogenic potential of alcohol in humans has now been confirmed, and a characteristic pattern of anomalies (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) is found in infants born to mothers who are chronic alcoholics. The pathogenesis of the fetal alcohol syndrome is unclear: very little is known about the way alcohol acts during pregnancy and alters fetal growth and morphogenesis. The objective of this investigation was to determine the effects of a widely used ethanol liquid diet in the pregnant rat. The ethanol liquid test diet is based on the Lieber-De Carli formula. 20 Sprague-Dawley rats were matched closely by weights and assigned in pairs to either an alcohol treated or a pair-fed control group. Control animals received the same amount of the liquid diet with maltose-dextrins substituted isocalorically for the ethanol. Graduated tubes were used for the oral delivery of the diets. Ethanol was gradually introduced into the diet as follows: 100 Kcal/l, days 1-2; 200 Kcal/l, days 3-5; 350 Kcal/l, days 6-12. Following this initial treatment period, all animals were then given rodent pellets and tap water ad libitum. The mothers showed no overt signs of gross toxicity. The mean maternal weight gain of the ethanol treated animals did not differ significantly from the controls. The incidence of fetal resorptions was increased, intrauterine growth was not affected and the offspring at term appeared normal. The results indicate that moderate alcohol consumption during early gestation in the rat led to significant prenatal loss but proved to be non-teratogenic.

N2  - Twenty children affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol are described. Their mothers either suffered from chronic alcoholism, or were binge or heavy drinkers while pregnant. Only in nine mothers (45%) was alcohol abuse recognized and associated with their babies' anomalies in the first months after birth; in some, the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome was delayed for many years. Alcohol abuse in pregnancy is probably a significant cause of birth and developmental defects in Australian children.

T1  - Some teratogenic properties of ethanol and acetaldehyde in C57BL/6J mice: Implications for the study of the fetal alcohol syndrome

N2  - To investigate the teratogenic effect of acute alcohol exposure, pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 25% ethanol (either two doses of 2.9 g/kg or one dose 5.8 g/kg) during the organogenic period either by intraperitoneal injections or by intubation. The incidence of malformations varied according to (1) the stage of embryonic development at the time of exposure, (2) the route of administration of the alcohol, and (3) the amount of alcohol given and the time period over which it was administered. Oral doses of alcohol were teratogenic although less so than the same dose given intraperitoneally, and two intraperitoneal doses four hours apart produced significantly more malformations than the same two doses six hours apart. The primary metabolite of alcohol, acetaldehyde, was also investigated for its teratogenicity. It was found that one or two doses of four percent acetaldehyde (0.32 g/kg), administered intraperitoneally were teratogenic. A further attempt was made to raise blood acetaldehyde levels by exposing mice to disulfiram, an inhibitor of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, prior to administration of alcohol. The disulfiram pretreatment did not increase the malformation rate. Treatment with alcohol on day 7 or 8 caused a variety of facial abnormalities, some of which were comparable to those seen in children with fetal alcohol syndrome. Exposure on day 9 or 10 resulted in limb defects. The results suggest that one or more episodes of heavy maternal drinking at critical periods in pregnancy may severely damage the embryo and may produce many features of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Alcohol can cause adverse effects at all levels of the nervous system, and it crosses the placenta. Occult brain damage occurs before clinical effects are apparent, as demonstrated by abnormal head CT scans in neurologically intact individuals. The fetal alcohol syndrome can occur in the absence of maternal signs of alcoholism and in a partial form, which, in isolated cases, is difficult to identify and relate to alcohol.

N2  - Forty children with the fetal alcohol syndrome were identified in the west of Scotland. All were growth retarded and had abnormal facial features, and all those who were tested were found to have neurological or developmental abnormalities. Two children died of associated physical defects. Most of the mothers were socially deprived, and all had drunk heavily while pregnant. Three women had subsequently died. These findings provide clear evidence that in the west of Scotland maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children.

The investigation revealed a broad scale of developmental hazards and psychopathologic symptoms indicating the negative long-range effects of alcohol abuse during pregnancy. The extent of morphologic damage was found to be a good predictor of psychopathology and mental impairment. Social environment and socioeconomic status appear less important as predictors.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a distinct pattern of malformation and mental impairment, to date associated only with advanced stages of maternal alcoholism. Children born to alcoholics are at risk for a wide range of problems, including one or a few of the characteristics of FAS. However, moderate to heavy drinking women, as a group, have a significantly increased probability of delivering smaller babies and having children who show some mild behavioral differences compared to controls whose mothers drink much less or not at all. The present review focuses primarily on recent scientific and medical findings and their implications for future research and prevention efforts.

N2  - Although alcohol has been used as a stimulant for centuries, the risk it represents to the unborn child has only recently received practical and scientific recognition. Alcohol is the most common teratogen today. Three out of every 1000 neonates are handicapped as a result of maternal alcoholism. Diagnosis is not usually difficult in severe cases, but the clinical and differential diagnosis of less severe and mild cases is very difficult. It is thus important for general practitioners and hospital doctors to be familiar with the symptoms, to recognise the diagnostic characteristics, and to know the best procedures for diagnosis.

Y1  - 1982//
N2  - The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on nipple attachment behavior was studied at a number of ages in rat pups whose mothers consumed liquid diets containing 35% or 0% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) or standard lab chow during pregnancy. In the first experiment, nondeprived pups were tested in groups of three (one from each of the prenatal treatment groups) for nipple attachment to an anesthetized lab chow dam. The second experiment examined the influence of the type of test dam (35% EDC, 0% EDC, or lab chow) on nipple attachment behavior. Finally, experiment three evaluated the possibility that the data from the preceeding experiments were the result of either testing the offspring in triads or alcohol-induced alterations in maternal behavior. Rat pups from all three groups reared by their biological mothers and a group of 35% EDC offspring fostered at birth to lab chow surrogate mothers were tested alone rather than in triads. The data from all three experiments clearly indicated an age-related pattern of nipple attachment behavior; the latency to attach was shortest in 6- to 12-day-old pups and increased rapidly from 13 to 21 days of age. Prenatal exposure to alcohol significantly increased the latency to attach to the nipple and the rank order of attachment at the younger ages (three to nine days of age) but not in the older animals. Also, the prenatal effect of alcohol was independent of the type of dam to which testing was conducted, the social interaction involved in testing triads, or fostering procedures. These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure can interfere with the development of normal suckling behavior, which might influence normal growth.

N2  - At the present time when so much attention is being paid to birth rates and planned pregnancies as well as to a general lowering of perinatal mortality and of prematurity and morbidity, we find that maternal alcoholism is a real medico-social problem for the community. Studying alcoholism in pregnant women has made it possible to work out a profile of the type of woman involved. The risk to the fetus was calculated not only in accordance with the quantities of alcohol taken and their metabolic effects on the embryo, the fetus and the newborn, but also on the general nutritional states (including lipids) and their effects, especially on the development of the brain. These different facts make it possible for us to work out a way of detecting and observing the woman closely during her pregnancy by carrying out repeated and combined tests especially on the level of alcohol in the blood and the level of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in the plasma. The consequences of maternal alcoholism are examined as to their effects during the progress of the pregnancy itself (abortion, prematurity and mortality) and especially on the product of the conception with its characteristic fetal alcohol syndrome (including a description of its, its incidence and the influence of previous alcoholism as well as the future of the child). The conclusion shows how important it is to do everything possible in the antenatal and post-natal clinics to prevent the condition but also to 'salvage' these children as far as possible when they have been born to alcoholic mothers so as to improve their nutritional and psycho-social states.

N2  - To study the effect of paternal chronic ethanol consumption on fetal development, an experimental rat model was established and compared to the fetal alcohol syndrome. Male and female Wistar rats were divided into 30% ethanol (E) and control groups. Before mating and during pregnancy the ethanol group and control group received E and water, respectively. Pregnancies were terminated on gestational day 21. The body weight, liver weight, blood glucose, serum insulin and cerebral CNPase activity were decreased in alcoholic males. The adverse effect of maternal chronic ethanol on fetal development was shown clearly and was not related to paternal ethanol. The adverse effect of paternal alcoholism on the fetus was shown in decreased litter size, or decreased body weight, cerebral weight and cerebral DNA, RNA and leucine incorporation into protein without a decrease in the litter size. The former finding was observed in the fetuses of aged male and female rats and latter in the fetuses of young female rats. In conclusion, both observations in our study indicate the adverse effect of paternal alcoholism on the fetal development.

N2  - In the past three years, we have seen three children who required prolonged inpatient admissions for severe feeding dysfunction resulting in nutritional and growth problems. The pregnancies were significant for severe maternal alcohol abuse during the entire pregnancy. All of the subjects had multiple physical findings and dysmorphic features seen in children with mild to severe fetal alcohol syndrome. Feeding evaluations showed significant delays in oral motor development. Specific oral motor dysfunction was not a commonality and did not appear to be a major determinant in delays in feeding development. Continued assessment revealed that the babies had limited suck patterns and were consistently noted to tire easily. Each required feeding by either gastrostomy and/or nasogastric feeding for prolonged periods of time. They started initial feeding by mouth at about 8 to 10 months. The times for complete oral feeding were 14, 17 and 18 months.

T1  - Can maternal alcohol ingestion cause neural tube defects?
A1  - Friedman J.M.
Y1  - 1982//
N2  - The importance of the teratogenic effects of ethanol have become increasingly well appreciated since the description of the fetal alcohol syndrome in 1973. Typical fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in babies exposed throughout gestation to chronic, heavy maternal alcohol ingestion (90 ml or more of absolute alcohol daily). We have recently seen three patients with neural tube defects and a history of maternal alcohol abuse during early gestation. In two of these cases, there were few or no stigmata of fetal alcohol syndrome. These observations suggest that exposure of an embryo to alcohol during neurulation may produce neural tube defects, even if the exposure is insufficient to cause typical stigmata of fetal alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 1982//
N2  - A study of 1,690 mother/child pairs at Boston City Hospital was conducted to assess the impact of maternal alcohol consumption on fetal development when confounding variables were controlled. Level of maternal drinking prior to pregnancy was associated with shorter duration of gestation. Lower maternal weight change, history of maternal illnesses, cigarette smoking, and marijuana use, however, were more consistently related to adverse fetal growth and development. New findings in this study include a negative association between maternal marijuana use during pregnancy and fetal growth. Also when confounding variables were controlled, women who used marijuana during pregnancy were five times more likely to deliver infants with features considered compatible with the fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Extended psychiatric and pediatric examinations were performed on patients with the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). A subgroup of these patients underwent psychological testing to measure intelligence, visual perception, and psycholinguistic abilities. Psychopathology was also studied in a matched control group. The investigation revealed a broad scale of development hazards and psychopathologic symptoms indicating the negative long-range effects of alcohol abuse during pregnancy. The extent of morphologic damage was found to be a good predictor of psychopathology and mental impairment. Social environment and socioeconomic status appear less important as predictors.

N2  - Four patients with clinical and laboratory features of the DiGeorge syndrome had a definite history of maternal alcoholism. Certain clinical abnormalities in the patients were characteristic of the DiGeorge syndrome as well as the fetal alcohol syndrome, including abnormalities of the eyes, ears, mouth, face, cardiovascular system, CNS, and immune system. Maternal alcoholism may result in the DiGeorge syndrome either as the single causative factor or in conjunction with other as yet unknown teratogens.

N2  - Presented is a review of the clinical manifestations of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the mode of action in this syndrome, the maternal malnutrition that may occur, and consideration that may prevent the development of FAS in the fetus. Several factors are discussed that may help explain the abnormalities noted in infants with FAS. Education regarding the dangers of alcohol abuse for pregnant women is essential in prevent the development of fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol-related birth defects.

Y1  - 1981//
N2  - Female Sprague-Dawley rats were either given 20% alcohol in drinking water and solid diet ad libitum (alcohol group) or were pair-fed to the alcohol group (pair-fed group) or were given water and solid diet ad libitum (ad libitum group) for four weeks. They were then mated and the alcohol group was changed to 30% alcohol in water. On day 20 gestation each rat was injected with 57Co-labeled microspheres into the left ventricle and radioactivity was determined in the placentas and kidneys. Cardiac output and blood flow to the placentas and kidneys was calculated. Fetuses and placentas were weighted, and the osmolality of the maternal plasma and water content of the muscle was determined. Cardiac output and blood flow to the kidneys did not differ among the three groups. Blood flow to the placenta, whether expressed as ml/min/g placenta or ml/min/placenta, or as % of cardiac output was significantly reduced in the alcohol group compared with the pair-fed and ad libitum groups, which did not differ from one another. Fetuses were significantly lighter and placentas were significantly heavier in the alcohol group than in the other two groups. Plasma osmolality was increased and muscle water was decreased about 7% in the alcohol group, indicating a moderate degree of dehydration. It is concluded that chronic alcohol consumption leads to a redistribution of blood, with less blood supplying the placentas. This may contribute to the growth retardation seen in fetal alcohol syndrome.

This is the first observation of polydactyly in rats as a consequence to exposure to ethanol in utero. These observations may be related to the occurrence of polydactyly and polysyndactyly in the fetal alcohol syndrome, which occurs in children born to human mothers who abuse alcohol during pregnancy.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of maternal alcohol ingestion on fetal growth and development in C3H mice. Mice were fed lab chow or isocaloric liquid diets containing either 30, 25, 20, or 0% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) for four weeks prior to and throughout pregnancy. The 25, 20, and 0% EDC groups were pair fed to the 30% EDC group, which had free access to the diet. On Day 18 of gestation, live fetuses were removed by caesarian section, weighed, and stored in Bouin's solution for subsequent teratological evaluation. The results indicated a dose-related effect of alcohol on prenatal mortality, fetal body weight, and frequency of soft tissue malformations. Comparisons between the chow and 0% EDC group on fetal outcome measures were not significant. Thus, restricted caloric intake, per se, cannot account for the teratological effects observed.

Y1  - 1981//
N2  - The effects of alcohol on the fetus include a wide range of problems; the complete fetal alcohol syndrome is the extreme end of the spectrum. At critical doses alcohol has the potential for multiple adverse effects on the maternal-placental-fetal system. Variability of outcome probably is related to individual differences in drinking patterns as well as in biologic susceptibility. At Boston City Hospital Prenatal Clinic, therapy was provided for pregnant women who reported drinking heavily. Reduction in maternal alcohol consumption before the third trimester was associated with improved neonatal outcome. The obstetrician's office is a potential site for prevention programs. A 10-question drinking history enables physicians to identify pregnant women at risk. Supportive counseling focused on reduction of alcohol use can be integrated with regular prenatal care. Pregnant women who do not respond promptly should be referred to specialized treatment programs. This strategy has the potential to improve the health of both mother and infant.

N2  - This prospective study examined long-term behavioral characteristics of children whose mothers drank alcohol and/or smoked cigarettes during pregnancy, compared to matched controls. Maternal habits had been assessed by interview during pregnancy: alcoholics and alcohol abusers were not included in this study. Primary outcome measures were naturalistic observations of children's behavior at age 4 in the home setting. Offspring of moderate drinkers (mean=0.45 oz. absolute alcohol/day during pregnancy) generally were less attentive, less compliant with parental commands, and more fidgety during mealtime than were offspring of occasional and non-drinkers (mean=0.07 oz. absolute alcohol/day during pregnancy). During storytime, an interaction of maternal drinking and child's sex occurred. The postnatal home environments did not differ as a function of maternal drinking or smoking habits.

N2  - This study investigates contingent negative variation (CNV) in ten children diagnosed as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and ten control children whose mothers reported only infrequent drinking during pregnancy. Cortical potentials were obtained using a procedure similar to Cohen's (1976) design. Stimuli consisted of a randomly presented flash followed 1.5 sec later by a tone. Sixty-four trials were presented with tone offset under experimenter control. For the next 128 trials, the subject pushed a button to turn off the tone. The EEG was recorded from Cz, P3, and P4 referred to linked earlobes. In addition, a resting EEG was obtained prior to the start of the trials. Cortical potentials were averaged separately over the two sets of trials and measures of slope and integrated amplitude obtained. Preliminary analysis showed that four of ten FAS children had negative slopes while eight of ten control children had negative slopes. These differences between groups, while in the predicted direction, were not statistically significant. Additional analyses are in progress.

Y1  - 1981//
N2  - Children diagnosed as FAS using standard criteria of maternal alcoholism, poor growth, delayed development and characteristic facial appearance underwent an investigative protocol involving skeletal x-ray surveys, cardiac assessments and intravenous pyelograms (IVP). Significant skeletal findings included cervical spine fusion in 20 of 46 children (43%), x-ray confirmation of microcephaly in 26/49 (53%) and abnormal thoracic cage development in 13/48 (27%). Thirty-nine of 54 children (72%) demonstrated a characteristic tapering of the shaft and occasional associated prominence of the tuft of the distal phalanges. Bone age was delayed 2 standard deviations or greater in 14 of 51 children (27%). Cardiac lesions were found in 31 of 76 (41%) and a further 12 (16%) had functional murmurs. Lesions were ventricular septal defect 20 (26%), Tetralogy of Fallot 4 (5.1%), plus a variety of less frequent abnormalities. IVP's were limited to 19 random cases with 5 (26%) showing alterations from the normal. Cervical spine abnormalities of FAS as compared to the Klippel-Feil Syndrome are dissimilar and probably represent a different entity. Hand and lateral cervical spine x-ray studies are felt to be a useful adjunct to the diagnosis and management of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Numerous studies have appeared in the literature which suggest that paternal alcohol consumption may have adverse effects on subsequent offspring. However, to date, no teratologic examination has been performed on fetuses conceived subsequent to paternal alcohol consumption. The present study has examined fetuses conceived by alcohol-treated male Swiss webster mice for gross anatomical congenital defects in an attempt to evaluate of possible mechanism for decreased viability of offspring sired by alcoholic males. Sexually mature males males were maintained for 28 days of a total liquid nutriment diet in which alcohol (6.3%, v/v, U.S.P. ethanol) comprised 32% of the caloric content. Subsequently, the animals were mated with nulliparous females. On day 18 of gestation, the gravid females were sacrificed and the fetuses were examined for congenital defects. Only 14% of the matings which occurred 3-5 days after alcohol treatment resulted in pregnancy, as alcohol-treated males during this time had reduced birth weight (0.85 +/- 0.04 g vs 0.92 +/- 0.11 g; p = 0.059) and crown-rump lengths (1.83 +/- 0.06 cm vs 1.99 +/- 0.11 cm; p<0.001) as compared to control fetuses. The frequency of congenital defects did not differ significantly between the experimental and control groups. No significant differences were noted between experimental and control progeny conceived more than 5 days after alcohol treatment. These results suggest that although some changes may be seen in progeny sired by alcohol treated males, the specific anomalies associated with the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome are most probably not due to paternal alcoholism.

T1  - Endocrine balance as a factor in the etiology of the fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Anderson Jr. R.A.
Y1  - 1981//
N2  - It is well documented that children with the fetal alcohol syndrome are a direct consequence of heavy maternal ethanol consumption during pregnancy. The mechanism by which ethanol exerts its teratogenic effect is however, far from understood. Recent experimental evidence has shown alcohol to have a direct inhibitory effect on embryogenesis. Little information, however, is available concerning other factors associated with maternal drinking which may contribute to abnormal fetal development. Proper materno-fetal hormonal balance is essential to insure successful pregnancy outcome. Of particular importance with respect to normal fetal development, are the levels of placental tropic hormones; pituitary hormones such as prolactin and oxytocin; adrenal cortical hormones; both maternal and fetal thyroid hormones; maternal and fetal sex hormones; and maternal insulin. Ethanol alters the levels of a variety of hormones associated with the hypothalamic/pituitary-gonadal, -adrenal and -thyroid axes. Many of these alterations have been observed in the male, however, with little data available on the female. In spite of the known adverse effect of ethanol on certain aspects of female reproductive function, few if any studies have examined the effects of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy on maternal endocrine balance. It is hoped that the present review will provide a rationale for the examination of alcohol effects on maternal endocrine hormones, as well as to provide possible target areas with respect to fetal development subsequent to ethanol-induced endocrine imbalance.

N2  - Alcohol was administered in a vitamin-supplemented liquid diet (Stardit) to Wistar rats 4 weeks before mating and during pregnancy. Of the daily calories 38-40% were supplied by alcohol and by isocaloric sucrose in the controls. Offspring of alcohol drinking dams showed a reduced birth weight and gained weight less rapidly than the controls. On day 3, 4, 7, 12, 17 and 21, experimental animals and controls were perfused for histological and electron microscopic investigations. Morphometric analysis of the cerebella (Fol. 5 and Fol. 8) showed no difference in the number of Purkinje cells. However, on day 7 the Purkinje cell nuclei of experimental pups were significantly smaller. This difference disappeared at day 12. Electron microscopic investigations in the 4, 7, and 12 days old experimental animals revealed a delayed cytoplasmic maturation of Purkinje cells which mainly involved the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At 17 days, there was no difference between the two groups. These data are discussed in relation to alcohol-induced metabolic changes in the brain.

T1  - Effects of alcohol on the fetus: Impact and prevention
A1  - Little R.E.
A1  - Streissguth A.P.
Y1  - 1981//
N2  - In the spectrum of adverse effects on the fetus or infant associated with maternal drinking during pregnancy the most dramatic is the fetal alcohol syndrome, a pattern of malformation that has been associatd with maternal alcohol abuse. Other undesirable outcomes of pregnancy linked to alcohol exposure in utero include growth deficiency, major and minor anomalies, decrements in mental and motor performance, and fetal and perinatal wastage. Alcohol, like other teratogens, does not uniformly affect all those exposed to it. Rather, there seems to be a continuum of effects of alcohol on the fetus with increasingly severe outcomes generally associated with higher intakes of alcohol by the mother. The cost of fetal damage associated with alcohol exposure is very high. A program to decrease the incidence of fetal alcohol effects is therefore imperative. The cornerstone of such a program must be not only education of the public but also careful training of all professionals who provide health care for pregnant women.

T1  - Alcohol and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy
A1  - Sokol R.J.
Y1  - 1981//
N2  - Heavy alcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy has long been suspected of being a risk factor for abnormalities in the fetus or infant. Only during the last decade have these assumptions been supported by scientific studies. A clustering of fetal defects observed in some cases has been labelled the fetal alcohol syndrome. The syndrome involves prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, central nervous sytem involvement and craniofacial abnormalities, some of which are characteristic of the syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome is relatively rare, affecting from 1 in 300 to 1 in 2000 infants; approximately 450 cases have been reported since the syndrome was identified. Despite this rarity, however, heavy alcohol consumption is an important risk factor during pregnancy. A review of the current literature indicates that in animals alcohol in high doses is embryotoxic and teratogenic, that heavy drinking is not uncommon before and during pregnancy and that the fetal alcohol syndrome and other effects on the fetus associated with alcohol abuse appear with significant frequency among mothers who drink heavily. Heavy alcohol consumption is a perinatal risk factor that not only can be detected by the physician, but also can be reduced in concerned, cooperative patients. Thus, awareness of this problem gives health care personnel an opportunity to help in the prevention of abnormal outcomes of pregnancy.

N2  - Experience so far accumulated, as well as clinical reports, are likely to suggest the existence of a causal relationship between chronic abuse of alcohol by pregnant women and intrauterine fetal damage, usually with poor prognosis. The pathological pattern of alcoholic embryopathy is characterised primarily by inhibition of prenatal and postnatal growth, cerebral damage, cranio-facial, skeletal, and extremity dysmorphism, cardiovascular dysplasia, abnormality of genital organs and of palmar crease, and atypical dermatoglyphics. Incidence and severity of malformations were found to depend on quantitative alcohol consumption, length of exposure to alcohol, phase of the mother's alcohol disease at the time of pregnancy, timing of exposure to alcohol during pregnancy, and genetically differentiated activities of alcohol-dehydrogenase. Prophylactic action against alcoholic embryopathy can be based on persuasion of drinkers to change their drinking habits. Medical termination of pregnancy should be proposed in severe cases of chronic alcoholism.

Y1  - 1981//
N2  - As the fetal alcohol syndrome is now regarded as the third commonest cause of congenital mental deficiency in man, it is surprising that little attention has been paid to the build up and concentration of ethanol in the tissues of the mother and fetus after oral administration of the agent. The recent introduction of the Alcolometer (Lion Laboratories Ltd) now makes it possible to make rapid and accurate measurements of ethanol levels in all tissues. We have used the Alcolometer to investigate the relationship between the time of administration of ethanol in the pregnant mouse and its concentration in certain maternal and fetal tissues, and in the liquor amnii. The extremely rapid concentration of ethanol in the maternal and fetal compartments suggests one reason at least why so called 'binge' drinking in early pregnancy is a potent cause of damage to the developing embryo. Another significant finding is the relationship between the levels of ethanol found in the fetus and liquor amnii respectively. This suggests that the fetus urinates ethanol into the liquor amnii, thereby setting up a to-and-fro distribution of ethanol between the fetus and the liquor, and producing a prolonged period of teratogenicity on the part of the agent.

T1  - Epidemiological appraisal of the literature on the fetal alcohol syndrome in humans
A1  - Neugut R.H.
Y1  - 1981//
N2  - An evaluation of the evidence regarding the association between heavy maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy and the occurrence in offspring of that cluster of abnormalities called the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is undertaken from an epidemiological perspective. Areas of concern in assessing the literature include the objectivity with which the maternal drinking history was obtained, the nature, systematic or not, of examination of offspring, the presence or absence of a comparison group, the control for potentially confounding factors and, perhaps most important of all, whether or not the identification of a case was made blind to knowledge of the maternal drinking history. While well-documented evidence that can implicate a hypothesized teratogen is difficult to obtain, the data available concerning the effects of in utero exposure to high doses of alcohol must be carefully and thoughtfully scrutinized so that valid inferences may be drawn. In this review particular attention is focused on the nature of the association between in utero alcohol exposure and mental retardation, certainly the most devastating of the FAS features.

N2  - The effects of prenatal alcohol on learning and retention of passive avoidance and discriminated shock escape were examined in offspring of rats who consumed isocaloric liquid diets containing either 35, 17.5 or 0% ethanol derived calories (EDC) or lab chow during pregnancy. Alcohol exposed progeny required more trials to reach criterion during passive avoidance acquisition and had shorter second trail latencies into the shock compartment than did controls. Both these measures were found to be direct functions of prenatal alcohol exposure. No differences between groups were evident during retention testing (1, 3, or 7 days later). During the 25 trial acquisition phase of T-maze escape, alcohol exposed progeny made more errors despite equivalent group performance by the end of training. During retention testing 24 hours later, these offspring again evidenced more errors regardless of whether or not the original contingencies were reversed. Both learning and retention deficits in the T-maze were directly related to the percent EDC consumed by the mother during pregnancy.

N2  - A methodology for investigating vigilance behavior in preschool children was developed. The administration of the task was adapted to young children and a scoring system was devised to adjust for the higher level of random responding found in this sample of preschoolers. 28 3- and 4-yr.-olds were given the Stanford-Biner Intelligence Test and a 12-min. vigilance task. The children, drawn from a sample used in a larger study, were the offspring of three groups of mothers: recovered alcoholics who drank during pregnancy, recovered alcoholics who did not drink during pregnancy, and nonalcoholics who drank litt or nothing during pregnancy. A significant correlation was found between the number of correct responses on the vigilance task and IQ (r26 = . 53, p less than .01). The conclusions that can be drawn regarding the relationship of vigilance to maternal alcohol use (chi 2 = 4.82, p less than .09) are limited by small sample size.

N2  - It has now become evident that alcohol is teratogenic to the fetus. However, the more subtle effects of alcohol on the fetus, and its subsequent effects on the developing child, are less well known, particularly in relation to borderline or retarded intelligence. What is uncertain is the amount of alcohol required to produce fetal damage, and the effect of a single excessive intake of alcohol during the organogenetic period in which the growing fetus is most susceptible. This paper reviews the current literature on the subject of alcohol in pregnancy and the fetal alcohol syndrome.

It was calculated that approximately 386 children with the full-blown fetal alcohol syndrome and 1,563 with alcohol-related birth defects were born in New York State in 1978. The lifetime cost of providing medical care, remedial education, and custodial care for this cohort of children was estimated at over $155 million. Limitations of the estimation procedures and in the data available on the incidence and cost of alcohol-related birth defects are discussed.

N2  - Pregnant Long-Evans rats were fed isocaloric liquid diets containing either 35% or 0% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) during gestation. In Experiment 1, female offspring were trained on an operant DRL 10-sec schedule of reinforcement beginning at approximately 80 days of age. Offspring of dams in the 35% EDC treatment group initially obtained a greater number of rewards as compared to 0% EDC controls under the DRL schedule. With extended training, differences between the two groups diminished. The introduction of a cue light, which signalled the availability of reward, had no differential effect upon the alcohol-treated animals and controls. Experiment 2 demonstrated that when a cue light was present from the onset of DRL 10-sec training, male and female offspring of the 35% EDC group generally obtained fewer rewards relative to their 0% EDC counterparts. The results are discussed in terms of lower operant bar press rates and poorer discrimination learning in alcohol-exposed progeny.

A1  - Anandam N.

Y1  - 1980//
N2  - The fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized behaviorally by mental retardation, which is usually accompanied by growth retardation as well. Studies with rats were carried out to assess the effects of alcohol in utero on preweanling learning and memory, in the absence of growth and developmental deficiencies. In Experiment 1,4 g ethanol/kg was intubated in a liquid diet twice daily to rats on gestation days 6-21. When tested on day 12 on an appetitively-motivated straight alley task, ethanol treated pups did not differ from controls in rate of acquisition or extinction. In Experiment 2, ethanol was administered to dams via a high-protein liquid diet containing 30% ethanol derived calories between gestation day 6 to delivery. When tested on day 10 on an appetitively-motivated Y-maze discrimination task, ethanol treated pups required more trials to reach criterion during acquisition and reversal than controls. On day 12, the groups did not differ significantly on the performance of the previously acquired response. These results indicate that prenatal ethanol-induced impairments of learning (if sufficiently complex) are present in rat pups as early as 10 days of age.

T1  - Teratogenic effects of ethanol in human beings
A1  - Nitowsky H.M.
Y1  - 1980//
N2  - Clinical and epidemiologic studies during the past decade have strongly implicated alcohol as a teratogen for human beings. Evidence supporting this contention has been obtained in studies on various species of experimental animals. Maternal alcohol use during gestation can result in the fetal alcohol syndrome characterized by somatic growth retardation, abnormalities of the central nervous system with psychomotor retardation and disturbances in behavior, and a cluster of facial dysmorphic features. Clinical observations suggest that more subtle manifestations of alcohol teratogenicity can occur, such as a reduction in mean birth weight with no other apparent somatic effects, or milder central nervous system effects presenting in later childhood as learning disability or behavioral deficits. There is no evidence in support of a safe threshold for alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Although no simple dose-response relationship has been defined, clinical observations indicate that heavier maternal alcohol use during gestation is associated with a greater frequency and severity of adverse pregnancy outcomes. These include a higher risk for early spontaneous abortion and a higher perinatal mortality rate. Many of these and related issues may be resolved with prospective studies correlating maternal alcohol use and pregnancy outcome, particularly if more objective quantitative measures of alcohol consumption can be employed.

N2  - Piglets from 12 litters farrowed by 18-mo-old, first litter (L1) alcohol-consuming dams were evaluated for altered morphology. A second group of piglets, farrowed by six 3-yr-old, second litter (L2) alcohol-consuming dams, was also evaluated. Litters from 6 non-alcohol-consuming gilts and 6 non-alcohol-consuming sows were used as controls. Mean litter size and birth weight for L1 and L2 piglets were significantly less than controls. Fetal mortality rates for L1 and L2 piglets were much greater than controls. Anomaly rates observed in fetal deaths were 11% and 100% for L1 and L2, respectively; no anomalies were seen in the control group piglets. Anomalies observed in group L1 included prolapsed rectum, undescended testicle, hypoplastic testicular tissue, and microphthalmia. Anomalies seen in group L2 included one occurrence of each of the following: anencephaly, microcephaly, cranial bone hypoplasia, microphthalmia, cleft palate, hypoplasia of extremities, hypodactylia, polydactylia, cryptorchism, hypoplastic gonadal tissue, cloacal atresia, and two occurrences of micrognathia, syndactylia, and hypoplasia of tail. Open-field activity behavioral studies show significantly greater activity in the offspring of alcohol-consuming dams. The data from Sinclair (S-1) miniature swine support the data from other species, establishing the relationship between maternal alcohol consumption and fetal anomalies.

N2  - Aspects of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) not previously emphasized are illustrated by 7 new cases, 2 of whom are aboriginal patients. The diagnostic and social importance of seeking further affected family members, and the influence of associated adverse factors are discussed. The concept of a critical period in gestation, or 'binge' susceptibility of the fetus and a spectrum of FAS presentations are described. An increasing prevalence of FAS may be expected with current alcohol consumption trends in Australian females. A possible plan of management of 'at-risk' mothers is briefly outlined.

N2  - Maternal alcoholism represents one of the major causes of infantile deficiency. It is also responsible in humans for 2-3 per thousand of congenital malformations. The morphological caracteristics of the fetal alcohol syndrome are described. The dymorphogenic risk increases with the chronicity of the maternal alcoholism. Alcohol intoxication produces in mice fetal resorptions and congenital malformations. Preventive measures are discussed, through a better clinical information and increased experimental investigations.

A1  - Chernoff G.F.
Y1  - 1980//
N2  - CBA, C3H, and C57 female mice maintained on a diet of 20 percent ethanol-derived calories prior to and throughout gestation were mated in a diallele cross. Prenatal death, malformations, and fetal weights were directly related to maternal blood alcohol levels, indicating a maternal effect. Fetal abnormalities and maternal blood alcohol levels varied with maternal strain (CBA > C3H > C57) and were inversely related to maternal alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Microsomal ethanol oxidizing systems induction was directly associated with increased fetal abnormalities, being greatest in CBA females. These results indicate that liability for the pattern of malformation observed in this syndrome is dependent on maternal blood alcohol levels, which are determined by the rate of maternal alcohol metabolism as well as the amount of maternal alcohol consumption.

Y1  - 1979//
N2  - Retrospective and prospective investigations of children to alcoholic women gave an incidence of fetal alcohol lesion of one per 300 deliveries of whom half had the complete fetal alcohol syndrome. Perinatal and infant mortalities were increased seven to tenfold and low birth weight (< 2500 g), preterm deliveries (<37 weeks) and smallness for gestational age (<-2 S.D.) were increased eightfold, threefold and twelvefold, respectively. Small size at birth correlated with reduced mental performance later in life, 58% had IQ below 85 and 19% below 70. 8% had cerebral palsy. The incidence of cerebral palsy associated with maternal inebriety was 1/5000 deliveries, i.e., every sixth case of cerebral palsy. Tracing of alcoholic women during pregnancy and treatment had favourable effects on intrauterine growth when sobriety could be induced early in pregnancy but could not protect from functional brain disturbance measured by neurological performance and by evoked response electroencephalography. Damage to the fetus by alcohol is now the largest known health hazard by a noxious agent that is preventable.

N2  - Maternal alcoholism can cause fetal damages irreversibly compromizing either the somatic or the mental development. It can also giving rise to malformations of various organs, particularly of the C.N.S. Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by a serious defect of growth by typical dysmorphic features and behavior anomalies which are recognizable already in the neonatal age. Therapeutic possibilities do not exist for affected subjects; the only remedy for the moment is the prevention of pregnancy in chronic alcoholic women, which obviously presents various difficulties and problems.

N2  - The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on thermotaxic behavior was investigated in 5-day-old rat pups. Pregnant dams were administered a liquid diet which contained 35% ethanol-derived calories (35% EDC) on days 6 to 20 of gestation. Two control groups were included: a liquid diet control which was pair-fed and had sucrose substituted for ethanol (0% EDC), and a group fed standard lab chow (LC) throughout pregnancy. Pups from each of these prenatal treatments were tested on a thermal gradient (thermocline). On each of 5 trails, pups were placed in the cool end of the thermocline and their position along the gradient was measured after 10 min. All prenatal treatment groups displayed thermotaxic behavior by moving towards the warm end. However, pups in the 35% EDC treatment group moved significantly further towards the warm end in the later trials. Despite their position on a warmer surface, their body temperature did not rise concurrently. Thermoregulatory deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure might account for these results.

N2  - To study the role of genetic factors in the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behaviour, dams of two rat lines developed to differ in voluntary alcohol intake, alcohol-preferring (AA) and alcohol-avoiding (ANA) rats were given a 5-10% alcohol solution mixed with a 1% sucrose solution as a sole drinking liquid throughout gestation. Sleep-wake behaviour of the offspring was studied at the ages of 7, 14 and 20 days, using a movement-sensitive mattress. In ANA rats, sleep recordings showed that prenatal alcohol exposure increased the percentage of waking but decreased the percentage of active sleep. Sleep-wake behaviour of the AA rats was not affected by alcohol exposure in utero. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not change open field behaviour in 1 month old rats, except that the alcohol-exposed AA rats' defaecation was decreased. When rats were 3 months old, voluntary intake of 10% (v/v) alcohol increased for alcohol-exposed ANA rats and decreased for alcohol-exposed AA rats as compared to the controls. The results indicate that AA rats may compensate for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behaviour, whereas offspring of the alcohol-exposed ANA dams suffer from severe behavioural disturbances. These findings further suggest that genetic factors are responsible for the differences in the susceptibility of rat foetuses to alcohol-induced long-term effects on behaviour.

A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 1987//
N2  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on grooming, locomotion, and rearing in response to stress were examined in adult rats whose mothers consumed a liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories (EDC). Offspring of both pair-fed 0% EDC mothers and ad libitum chow-fed mothers were included as controls. In Experiment 1, females groomed more than males following placement into a novel test chamber, but no differences due to prenatal treatment were observed. Ethanol-exposed animals groomed more than controls following the stress of a forced 1-min swim (Experiment 2), but when rats tested in Experiment 1 were observed again after forced swim stress (Experiment 3), no differences due to prenatal treatment or sex were observed. Experiment 4 examined the effects of pretreatment with 1 mg/kg naloxone on novelty-induced grooming and as in Experiment 1 prenatal treatment did not affect grooming responses. Females again groomed significantly more than males and naloxone reduced grooming equally for all groups. The results suggest that novelty-induced grooming is a sex-influenced behavior, with females grooming more than males, and that animals exposed prenatally to alcohol and tested as adults may have altered responses to certain stressors (i.e., forced swim) under specific conditions. The altered grooming response of alcohol-exposed rats to swim stress can be eliminated by preexposing them to novelty stress.

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - Performance of a Morris water task was examined in young rats whose mothers consumed a liquid diet consisting of 35 % ethanol-derived calories (EDC) during pregnancy. Offspring of pair-fed (0 % EDC) and ad lib lab chow (LC) dams served as controls. Rats were required to find a platform submerged below the surface in a pool of opaque water. A trial ended when the rat remained on the platform for 15 sec, or had been in the tank for 180 sec reaching the platform. Subjects received 5 trials daily for 3 consecutive days, followed by reversal training on Day 4. Groups did not differ in swimming ability. On Day 1 there were no group differences among females in latency to reach the platform or in distance traveled, but male 35 % EDC and 0 % EDC animals had shorter latencies than LC controls. On Day 2, latencies and distance traveled of LC and 0 % EDC controls decreased while 35 % EDC animals showed no change from Day 1, so that alcohol-exposed rats took longer to reach the platform and traveled a greater distance than controls. On Day 3, 35 % EDC females took longer than controls to reach the platform, and 35 % EDC animals of both sexes traveled a greater distance than controls. Search patterns on the first reversal trial on Day 4 suggest the differences are in spatial processing and not learning per se, but more so in alcohol-exposed males than females. The impaired performance on this task suggests that prenatal alcohol exposure alters the ability to process spatial information.

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) describes a pattern of dysmorphogenesis observed in some offspring of women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy; partial expression of this pattern are fetal alcohol effects (FAE). The purpose of this investigation was to measure selected craniofacial parameters in the CD-1 mouse fetus following exposure to alcohol on gestational day (D) 8. CD-1 mice were mated for 1 hr; D0.0 designated by the presence of a vaginal plug. On D8, 0 hr, and D8, 4 hr, 33 dams were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 25% (v/v) alcohol in physiological saline solution (0.015 ml/gm maternal body weight). Appropriate controls were maintained. The animals were sacrificed every 12 hr from D12.0 through D17.0. Implantation sites were examined and recorded as live, dead, or resorbed fetuses. All live fetuses were weighed, examined for gross defects, and fixed in Bouin's solution. Twenty-three bilateral parameters were recorded for linear dimensions defining face and cranium. The fetal weights were statistically lower in treated as compared to control fetuses only on D16.0 through D17.0. Statistical analysis of the morphometrics identified five distinct growth patterns in treated mice as compared to controls. The anomalies induced in the CD-1 mouse fetus following exposure to alcohol on D8.0 resembled FAE rather than FAS. Morphometric analysis of the cranofacial region may be an important clinical tool for the quantitative identification of alcohol-related effects in the offspring of women who consumed alcohol while pregnant.

N2  - Transient compression of the umbilical cord has been implicated as a potential cause of unexplained brain damage and/or fetal death. We induced acute fetal hypoxia by compressing the umbilical cord of the fetal rat with a microvascular clamp. Direct observation of fetal behavior immediately after cord compression identified a three-phase behavioral response to acute hypoxia, consisting of an initial suppression in motor activity, a brief period of hyperactivity, and a secondary suppression of movement. All three phases occurred in <2 minutes from the onset of hypoxia. The stereotypic hypoxic response of rat fetuses may be adaptive as a means of removing mechanical sources of umbilical cord compression. Among fetuses exposed to alcohol in utero, the response to hypoxia was diminished in intensity and duration. Because of their altered hypoxic response, alcohol-exposed fetuses may therefore be at greater risk from transient cord compression in utero.

N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes malformations of the eyes with serious consequences to the vision of the affected children. A high percentage (up to 90%) of children suffering from the fetal alcohol syndrome have eye abnormalities, including malformation in the outer eye region, disorders of motility, and defects of different intraocular structures. Two kinds of malformations stand out as most typical - hypoplasia of the optic nervehead (up to 48%) and increased tortuosity of the retinal vessels, especially of the arteries (up to 49%). Visual acuity is often moderately or severely reduced. Considering the developmental timing of different tissues of the eye, one can presume that there is a risk for deleterious effects of alcohol on eye structures at any point of time from early gestation until development is completed.

T1  - Heredity and alcohol-induced brain anomalies: Effects of alcohol on anomalous prenatal development of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - Using two inbred strains of mice which have similar rates of alcohol metabolism, we asked whether prenatal alcohol exposure would cause greater incidence and severity of defects in the development of two forebrain fiber tracts, the corpus callosum and the anterior commissure, in mice prone to these defects (BALB/c) than in mice not prone to these defects (C57BL/6). Pregnant animals were fed 0.6 kcal/g body weight of a Sustacal-based liquid diet containing 0, 15, 17.5, 20, or 25% ethanol-derived calories from day 7 to fetal assessment on day 18 of gestation. Most of alcohol's greatest effects and the greatest strain differences in alcohol's effects on fetal variables were produced by the 17.5% diet. This dose had inhibitory effects on fetal body, brain, and midsagittal corpus callosum and anterior commissure growth. All these effects, except that on brain weight, were significantly greater in C57s than in BALBs. When the results were compared with prenatal growth curves for normal untreated mice, the effect of alcohol on corpus callosum but not anterior commissure growth was largely explained by its effects on overall development. The 17.5% diet had a greater specific effect on size of the anterior commissure in C57s than BALBs but increased the incidence and severity of its permanent dysmorphology in BALBs more than in C57s. Anterior commissure size and morphology may be sensitive indicators of alcohol's effects on prenatal brain development. Hereditary differences in rate of maternal alcohol metabolism no doubt have important consequences for risks arising from prenatal alcohol exposure. However, this study clearly indicates that inherited factors, other than those that influence rate of alcohol metabolism, are important influences on the overall fetal response and the specific responses of the anterior commissure to prenatal alcohol exposure.

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - Serum estradiol, estriol, progesterone, PRL, and hCG concentrations were measured at 4-week intervals in 40 pregnant women who chronically abused alcohol and in 20 abstinent pregnant women. Sixteen alcohol users gave birth to infants with the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), whereas the remaining 24 infants of alcohol users and all infants of the abstinent women were healthy. The women whose infants had the FAS had decreased estradiol and estriol levels throughout pregnancy. Progesterone levels also tended to be low. In contrast, the alcohol users had increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy compared with those in the abstinent women, but this rise was not related to the FAS. The concentrations of hCG fluctuated widely, without any consistent difference between alcohol users and abstinent women. Thus, heavy maternal abuse of alcohol resulting in FAS is accompanied, primarily or secondarily, by reduced estrogen concentrations throughout pregnancy and increased PRL levels during the 16-24th week of pregnancy.

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - As part of the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Questionnaire administered in the 1985 National Health Interview Survey, nearly 20,000 respondents ages 18-44 answered questions about their awareness of the risks of smoking and heavy drinking during pregnancy. In reference to smoking, interviewers asked about miscarriage, still-birth, prematurity, and low birth weight; in reference to heavy drinking, they asked about miscarriage, mental retardation low birth weight, and birth defects, as well as fetal alcohol syndrome. For each of these adverse outcomes, a majority of subjects acknowledged increased risk because of smoking or heavy drinking during pregnancy. The range was 66-80 percent of respondents for the four questions on smoking, with the perceived association to smoking strongest for low birth weight. Approximately 84 percent of respondents associated heavy drinking with increased risk for each of the suggested pregnancy outcomes. Smoking seemed to be perceived to pose a lesser risk to pregnency than heavy drinking. This relative lack of awareness of the pregnancy risks of smoking was more apparent among respondents with less education and more pronounced among blacks than whites. Women were more likely than men to express some opinion on these pregnancy-related questions and were more cognizant than men of the risks. On this limited survey, Americans ages 18-44 were not very knowledgeable about fetal alcohol syndrome. Among the 55 percent who had heard of fetal alcohol syndrome, fewer than one in four correctly identified it as a set of birth defects when offered three possible definitions. It will be interesting to correlate responses to these 'knowledge' questions with NHIS data still forthcoming on reported actual smoking and drinking behavior among women respondents who were recently pregnant.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and offspring hyperactivity: Effects of para-chlorophenylalanine and methysergide
A1  - Bond N.W.
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to either a liquid diet containing ethanol, pair-fed an identical diet with sucrose substituted for ethanol, or received ad lib chow and water, during days 6-19 of gestation. Pups were injected with a dose of 100 mg/kg of para-chlorophenylalanine, 48 hr, 24 hr or immediately prior to activity testing at 16, 22 or 28 days of age. Further groups were injected with isotonic saline just prior to activity testing. Pups exposed to alcohol prenatally were more active than controls at 16 days of age. Para-chlorophenylalanine brought about significant increases in activity when injected 24 or 48 hr prior to testing in 16-day-old pups, and significant increases in activity when injected 24 hr prior to testing in 22- and 28-day-old pups. However, these effects of para-chlorophenylalanine were similar regardless of prenatal treatment. In a second study, 16-day-old pups received saline, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg of methysergide immediately prior to an activity test. Methysergide brought about a dose-related decrease in activity in all three groups of pups. Most importantly, the effects on activity of the methysergide were similar regardless of the treatment received during gestation. These data indicate that the hyperactivity associated with fetal alcohol exposure is unlikely to result from alterations in the ontogeny of a serotonergic system involved in response inhibition.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Several questions in the 1985 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Questionnaire, which was part of the 1985 National Health Interview Survey, addressed respondents' consumption of alcohol. Sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of health risks related to heavy drinking, health practices, and the prevalence of certain health conditions were examined in relation to drinking levels. Although cause-effect relationships should not be inferred from the associations, the findings suggest some provocative areas for prevention and research. Heavier drinkers were more commonly found among men than women. Level of drinking was associated positively with years of education and family income, but was inversely related to age. Compared with light drinkers, heavier drinkers were much more likely to drive after they had had too much to drink. While more than 90 percent of the population knew that heavier drinking increases the risk of liver cirrhosis, less than half knew about the increased risk of throat cancer and cancer of the mouth. Most respondents aged 18-44 years (80 percent or more) knew that heavy drinking increases the chance of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and more women than men (62 versus 49 percent) had heard of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, 70 percent or more of those who had heard of FAS described the syndrome as a newborn addicted to alcohol rather than a child born with certain birth defects. Heavier drinkers of both sexes were less likely than others to be nonsmokers, and moderate drinkers were more likely than others to exercise or play sports regularly. Moderate drinkers also tended to have lower lifetime prevalence rates than others for hypertension and heart trouble.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Umbilical cord length is reported to be a good indicator of fetal movement. This study was designed to examine the effects of chronic alcohol exposure on umbilical cord length in fetal rats. Exposure to alcohol during prenatal development was associated with shortened umbilical cord length, relative to controls. This finding was not a function of body weight differences alone and provides evidence that fetal movements may be decreased as a consequence of maternal alcohol consumption. The possible role of suppresed fetal movements in some of alcohol's teratogenic actions is also discussed.

A1  - Ager J.
A1  - Martier S.
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Typically, the rate of abusive drinking during pregnancy considerably exceeds the rates of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related birth defects, suggesting that other factors may modify the impact on the developing organism. Data in the literature supporting this susceptibility hypothesis are sparse. In this paper, two studies in different samples, using different analytic strategies to examine susceptibility to different adverse outcomes are presented. Among 176 pregnancies in which lowered birth weight for gestational age was detected as an effect attributable to frequent beer drinking, 27 infants weighted < 2,700 grams and 149 weighed more. Using discriminant analysis to contrast these groups, lowered birth weight for gestational age was associated with black race and lower maternal weight and weight gain. The effects of these factors were additive with that of persistent alcohol exposure; no interactions were detected, but pregnancies with risks in addition to alcohol were more likely to yield growth-retarded infants. In a second study, pregnancies resulting in 25 FAS cases were contrasted with 50 controls. A four-factor model accounted for nearly two-thirds of the explainable variance in the occurrence of FAS. Adjusted for frequency of maternal drinking, chronic alcohol problems and parity, there was a sevenfold increase in risk for FAS among black infants. The findings from both studies are consistent with the susceptibility hypothesis and have potentially important implications for public health and clinical approaches to prevention, as well as for future research.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Acute and chronic intubations of ethanol to pregnant rats produced changes in spontaneous fetal behavior four hours later. Fetuses from mothers in intermediate alcohol groups (4 and 6 g/kg) were substantially less active than controls (0 g/kg), but fetuses from low (2 g/kg) and high (8 g/kg) alcohol groups showed little indication of behavioral suppression. Circulating levels of alcohol in maternal blood, fetal homogenate and amniotic fluid at the time fetuses were observed confirmed that fetuses were exposed to alcohol in utero, but the measured concentrations of alcohol were not predictive of fetal activity. We suggest that some of the developmental consequences of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome may be the consequence of fetal inactivity induced by alcohol in utero.

N2  - Pregnant rats were intubated with alcohol (3.5 g/kg, twice daily) on gestation days 11-21. Control animals were intubated with an isocaloric sucrose solution and were pair-fed and pair-watered to alcohol-treated dams. At birth, offspring were placed with non-treated surrogate dams. When animals were slightly more than 1 year of age, they were tested for passive avoidance learning, spontaneous alternation and activity. Groups did not differ in passive avoidance learning or spontaneous alteration but animals prenatally exposed to alcohol were more active than controls. Additional studies showed that this increased activity was not affected by testing animals in the presence of environmental stimuli such as objects which could be manipulated, or by odors from mouse shavings from male and female mice.

T1  - Is social drinking during pregnancy harmless?
A1  - Hatfield D.
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - The last 10 to 15 years have provided a growing body of evidence that demonstrates a distinct relationship between excessive alcohol consumption during pregnancy and birth defects. In light of this voluminous quantity of research, no responsible health professional or researcher would deny that alcohol can cause fetal abnormalities if consumed chronically and in large quantities. However, close examination of the literature does not support the no threshold corollary - that is that any amount of alcohol will have a detrimental effect on the fetus. At present, it appears that only those women who consume large amounts of alcohol on a chronic basis are at risk of giving birth to children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and its associated anomalies. Prevention should be aimed at this group of women. Blanket warnings and recommendations for total abstinence may serve little purpose other than to instill unnecessary fear, anxiety and guilt in those women at little or no risk while having no affect on the real target audience; the chronic heavy drinkers.

N2  - The present study examined the effects of physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on activity in young rats whose mothers consumed isocaloric liquid diets containing 35% or 0% ethanol-derived calories on days 6-20 of pregnancy. A pair-feeding procedure was utilized and an ad libitum lab chow group was included. Physostigmine was administered to 18-day-old offspring on 3 consecutive days with activity measures recorded for 30 min each day. Injections of physostigmine produced significant reductions in activity in alcohol-exposed offspring relative to control groups. These results provide support for a functional cholinergic deficit in offspring exposed to alcohol in utero and may have relevant clinical implications in the treatment of attentional deficit disorder which can occur following prenatal alcohol exposure.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - A survey was conducted to ascertain the extent to which programs have been undertaken to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and/or fetal alcohol related birth defects. A questionnaire was sent to the public health departments in each state and the District of Columbia. Telephone follow-up interviews were conducted. Data were obtained with respect to the nature and costs of fetal alcohol syndrome (and fetal alcohol effects) prevention programs. Other information was elicited concerning perception of fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects as a health problem. The major conclusion was that, as a whole, state governments have not made a sustained commitment to the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome. There are some instructive exceptions, however. Several states have initiated programs that could serve as a model for a national effort. These data, scant as they are, suggest that a properly focused and balanced prevention program can reduce maternal alcohol consumption.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Rats were prenatally exposed to alcohol (3.5 g/kg/twice daily) on gestation days 11-21. Control animals were vehicle-treated and pair-fed or untreated and fed ad lib. When animals were more than 1 year of age, they were tested for nose-poking behavior with female mice or empty cages and then male mice or empty cages as test stimuli. Alcohol exposed animals made significantly more nose pokes than pair fed or ad lib fed controls. Alcohol exposed females made significantly more nose pokes with female mice as test stimuli whereas males made fewer nose pokes when tested with female mice as test stimuli. Testing in the presence of male mice did not affect nose poking significantly. Nose poking of female alcohol-exposed animals was not affected by female mouse bedding relative to testing with empty cages but was increased in male alcohol-exposed males relative to empty cages.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Thousands of children are born each year with alcohol-related birth defects. However, despite comparable levels of prenatal alcohol exposure, some children are affected less severely than others, whereas others do not appear to be affected at all. Epidemiological investigations and experimental studies in animals suggest that maternal or fetal genetic factors, maternal age or parity, and pattern of drinking are important risk factors affecting alcohol's actions on the embryo/fetus. Identifying these and other risk factors may provide a means for cost-effective prevention efforts.

T1  - Lithium and the neonate: Developmental and metabolic aspects
A1  - Messiha F.S.
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - The interrelationship between lithium salts, which has been used in clinical trials of alcoholism, and ethanol, which evoke fetal alcohol syndrome by chronic use, was studied. This was made by evaluating the effect of prenatal and postnatal exposure to LiCl on ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolizing enzymes in the newborn mouse. The three Li-treatment regimens made consisted of acute and short-term prenatal exposure to LiCl in addition to postnatal exposure until weaning of the neonates. The weaned mice were then kept on water for a subsequent two weeks prior to sacrifice. The effects of LiCl given in drinking fluid, on body weight, selected organ weights, hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and heart lactate dehydrogenase of the offspring were determined. Prenatal and postnatal ingestion of LiCl by the nursing mother resulted in decreased brain weight of offspring from both sexes. Concomitantly, there was a reduction in female but not male kidney weight. A marked decrease in the testis weight also occurred. The Li-treatment induced both neonatal hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase and heart lactate dehydrogenase in both sexes. Conversely, an inhibition of hepatic mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, for the enzyme with the apparent high K(m), was determined in the male offspring. Maternal postnatal ingestion of LiCl decreased brain and spleen weights from corresponding control of neonatal male and female, respectively. This Li-treatment also induced hepatic neonatal alcohol dehydrogenase in both sexes. The results suggest that maternal ingestion of LiCl may interfere in brain development. It appears that the spleen, kidney and the testis are sensitive to Li effects depending on duration of maternal exposure to LiCl and to the neonatal sex. The induction of neonatal hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase concomitant with no changes or inhibition of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase may render them susceptible to alcohol intoxication, particularly to acetaldehyde toxicity.

T1  - Pituitary-adrenal responses to morphine and footshock stress are enhanced following prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Nelson L.R.
A1  - Taylor A.N.
A1  - Lewis J.W.
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - The effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on pituitary-adrenal function in adult offspring was assessed by measuring corticosterone (CS) levels in plasma following exposure to two forms of footshock stress, intermittent and continuous, and after administration of 20 mg/kg of morphine. The footshock experiments were conducted at two time points in the circadian pituitary-adrenal cycle. Prenatally ethanol-exposed (E) rats had higher levels of CS than pair-fed and normal controls following intermittent footshock when tested at the crest of the CS circadian rhythm. However, this difference was not present when intermittent footshock was presented at the trough of the circadian cycle. At either time of day, there were no differences among the prenatal treatment groups in the basal condition or following continuous footshock. In addition, E rats had significantly higher levels of plasma CS than controls following morphine. Plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels were measured after intermittent footshock at the crest of the circadian rhythm and were significantly higher in E rats than in controls. These results extend our previous reports of enhanced activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in response to other stressors as well as to ethanol in adult rats exposed to ethanol in utero. They also confirm that E rats are differentially hyperresponsive only to intermittent footshock stress, not to continuous footshock, as we had found to be the case when the analgesia induced by these two stressors was the dependent measure.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - The effects of maternal alcohol use on mental development, growth, and dysmorphogenesis was studied in a sample of 1-year-old infants born to elderly primiparous mothers. Alcohol intake was measured using Jessor's AA score and a simple count of maximum number of drinks consumed in one day. Infant cognition was assessed using the Bayley Scale of Mental Development. Alcohol levels prior to during and following pregnancy were obtained. Alcohol intake was greatly reduced during pregnancy, returning to prepregnancy levels following birth. A significant linear relationship between drinking prior to pregnancy and infant mental development was found. The average mental development score of infants whose mothers consumed < 3, 3.3 to 29.7, or > 30 mL (< 0.10, 0.11 to 0.99, or > 1.0 average fluid ounces) of absolute alcohol per day was 115, 108, and 95, respectively. Maximum number of drinks consumed in a day related to physical anomalies. No alcohol measure was significantly correlated with condition at birth, postnatal illness, or growth parameters of height, weight, and head circumference at 1 year. Deficits found were less pronounced than those reported in infants with fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - Experimental studies on lipoprotein metabolism in rats reared with liquid alcohol diet from the fetal life
A1  - Tamura Y.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - Recently numerous reports show deleterious effects of alcohol abuse on pregnant women giving their children a high risk of stillbirth and/or several developmental abnormalities and mental retardation, i.e. the Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). In the present study, the effects of maternal alcohol consumption on lipid metabolism in the litter liver were investigated in rats. These rats showed not only quite less lipid deposition in spite of large amount of alcohol consumption up to adulthood, but also showed increased FFA oxidation in the livers. In addition, increased level of very low density lipoprotein and hypoglucagonemia were found. 40 micrograms/kg of glucagon which is known as an inhibitory factor of apoprotein production in the liver, was injected for 2 weeks into the rat tail vein and resulted in apparent fatty liver and hypolipoproteinemia. Norepinephrine injection (1 mg/kg) caused plasma glucagon to be depressed in the rat as compared with adult alcohol rats. Plasma cyclic AMP response to glucagon was also depressed in these rats. From these results, it is suggested that the deranged glucagon secretion from the pancreas and lowered glucagon-induced cyclic AMP response would relate to the abnormal lipoprotein metabolism in the rat.

T1  - Pup-induced maternal behavior in adult and juvenile rats exposed to alcohol prenatally
A1  - Barron S.

Y1  - 1985//
N2  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on pup-induced maternal behaviors were examined in virgin rats whose mothers consumed liquid diets containing either 35 or 0% ethanol-derived-calories (EDC) on days 6-20 of gestation. A pair-feeding procedure was utilized to control for reduced caloric intake and, in addition, an ad libitum lab chow group was included to control for possible liquid diet effects. The results from experiments 1 and 2 revealed a sexually differential effect on this behavior in adult virgins exposed to alcohol in utero. Adult 35% EDC females showed a variety of deficits in maternal behaviors relative to controls; however, males with similar prenatal treatment appeared unaffected. In experiment 3, both 35% EDC male and female juveniles displayed altered maternal behaviors relative to controls. These results demonstrate yet another behavior sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure. Prenatal hormonal alterations occurring as a consequence of maternal alcohol consumption may be a mechanism by which this long term behavior effect is observed. This hypothesis and the importance of future research in this relatively new are of fetal alcohol studies are discussed.

Y1  - 1985//
N2  - Fetal alcohol effects in 359 infants born to disadvantaged women identified as having a history of alcohol abuse or as controls and who provided reports of alcohol use in pregnancy are being studied in a prospective design. Alcohol abuse was assessed with the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST). Alcohol use (AA/day) was based on short-term recall covering 2-week periods prior to each antenatal visit. A tally of anomalies associated with fetal alcohol syndrome was obtained in a blinded examination of each infant. This tally was significantly related to the MAST classification and, for the MAST+ subjects, the tally was related to first trimester AA/day. Birth weight, length, and head circumferences were negatively correlated with AA/day (entire pregnancy); however, the effect was attenuated and not statistically significant in models with covariate control. It is possible that these measures were near the threshold of effect. Scale scores of the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale and three scale scores of the Graham/Rosenblith Behavioral Examination of the Neonate were unrelated to the MAST classification and to AA/day.

N2  - Luteinizing hormone (LH) secretory patterns were characterized in adult male and female rats exposed to ethanol during the last week of fetal life. Gonadectomized fetal alcohol exposed (FAE) males and females had significantly reduced plasma LH titers as compared to those of pair-fed (PF) controls. The phasic afternoon LH secretory response to estrogen and progesterone priming was also significantly reduced in FAE females. These differences do not appear to be a result of altered pituitary sensitivity to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH), since the infusion of LHRH resulted in an equal response in PF and FAE females. Subsequent characterization of the episodic pattern of LH secretion in FAE males revealed significantly reduced mean LH level as well as a decreased pulse amplitude and frequency when compared to PF males. Taken together, these data indicate that some of the central mechanisms controlling pituitary LH secretion are altered by prenatal exposure to alcohol.

A1  - Rudeen P.K.
A1  - Guerri C.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - The neural membrane-bound enzymes, acetylcholinesterase, Na/K-ATPase and Ca-ATPase were examined in six brain areas in perinatal rats at 5, 15 and 25 days of age following alcohol exposure in utero. Female Wistar rats were mated with adult male Wistar rats and maintained on either a liquid diet containing ethanol (5% w/v) or on a control liquid diet for various periods during gestation and the perinatal period. These periods were: before and during gestation only (until birth of the offspring); before and during gestation and following birth; during only a period of gestation and contuining postnatally. Enzyme activity was determined by spectrophotometric methods in the following areas of the brain in each offspring: telencephalon, cerebellum, hippocampus, septal area, preoptic area, and medial basal hypothalamic area. Analysis of the data indicates that alcohol exposure in utero will heterogeneously decrease enzyme activity among the six brain areas when compared to enzyme activity in the same brain areas in animals which were not exposed to alcohol in utero. The activity of the three enzymes were most significantly reduced on day 5 of age, compared to levels in the control animals. Enzyme activity in each brain area was generally most significantly affected in animals exposed to alcohol both pre- and postnatally. The results indicate that fetal alcohol exposure reduces neuronal enzyme activity relative to the period of ethanol exposure in utero; the longer the period of time that alcohol was consumed by the mothers of pre- and postnatally, the greater the effect of alcohol on the enzyme activity. Also maturation of enzyme activity is heterogeneous in the brain areas examined; alcohol exposure in utero affects the development of the enzyme activity differentially in the different areas of the brain.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome in twin pregnancy
A1  - Chasnoff I.J.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - In recent years, it has been realized that some infants of frankly alcoholic mothers escape the stigmata of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and others have only a few of the characteristics. These infants are thought to display fetal alcohol effects (FAE). The controversy regarding the amount of alcohol a woman can safely drink during pregnancy and the effects of timing and individual physiology on producing FAS vs FAE in the infant are important questions which can perhaps be partially answered through examining twin pregnancies and offspring. Data are presented regarding the long-term growth and development of a set of dizygotic twins, one with FAS and one with FAE, delivered to a mother who drank moderate amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. The variation in the degree of abnormality found in dizygotic twins exposed to similar amounts of alcohol at the same time during gestation indicates that differences in fetal susceptibility to ethanol dysmorphogenesis are of prime importance to the expression of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and offspring hyperactivity: The effects of home-cage shavings and test chamber temperature
A1  - Bond N.W.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - Rats were fed a liquid diet containing alcohol from days 6-19 of gestation. Controls were pair-fed the same diet with sucrose substituted for ethanol, or were allowed ad-lib chow and water. The activity of the offspring was observed in isolation at 10, 16, 22, or 28 days of age. Offspring exposed to alcohol prenatally were hyperactive relative to controls at 16 and 22 days, but not at 10 or 28 days. The presence of home-cage shavings in the test chamber affected the activity of the three groups similarly. In a second study, isolation-induced activity was observed at a test room temperature of 23degree or 33degreeC. Offspring exposed to alcohol were hyperactive in comparison with pair-fed controls, at both 16 and 22 days, when tested at 23degreeC. However, the difference in activity was attenuated at 16 days and abolished at 22 days if pups were tested at 33degree C. These findings indicate that the hyperactivity displayed by alcohol-treated offspring may be due in part to their experiencing greater thermal stress when removed from their dam and littermates.

T1  - Effects of scopolamine on spontaneous alternation and shuttle avoidance in rats exposed to alcohol in utero
A1  - Rockwood G.A.
A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - The behavioral effects of the anticholinergic scopolamine were examined in rats exposed to alcohol prenatally. Pregnant Long-Evans rats received isocaloric liquid diets containing either 35% or 0% ethanol-derived calories on Days 6-20 of gestation. A pair-feeding procedure was used, and a lab chow control group was also included. In Experiment 1, adult offspring were tested on a spontaneous alternation task following 1 mg/kg scopolamine or saline. Independent of prenatal treatment, scopolamine caused an increase in the number of trials to alternate. In experiment 2, offspring were tested on a two-way shuttle avoidance learning task following a 1 mg/kg injection of scopolamine or methylscopolamine. Alcohol-exposed animals injected with methylscopolamine made fewer avoidances than controls on the second day of testing while treatment with scopolamine enhanced avoidance performance to control levels. These data suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol does not interfere with scopolamine-induced changes in the behavior of adult rats.

T1  - Zinc deficiency acts as a co-teratogen with alcohol in fetal alcohol syndrome

A1  - Rennert O.M.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - Because alcoholism has adverse effects on zinc nutrition and many pregnant women consume less than the recommended dietary allowances of zinc, we postulated that zinc deficiency acts as a co-teratogen with alcohol in the fetal alcohol syndrome. We compared the effects of alcohol on progeny of pregnant mice fed a zinc-deficient diet compared to those fed a diet with adequate zinc. Pregnant CBA mice (n=66) were fed the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet with 0, 15, or 20% ethanol-derived calories containing 0.3 (low) or 8.5 (high) mug zinc/ml. Dams were sacrificed on day 18 of gestation. Resorptions, malformations, and individual fetal weights were recorded. Analysis of fetuses included assays for zinc, assessment of soft tissue malformations, and alizarin red staining for skeletal malformations. Fetal weights were lower in the groups fed the zinc-deficient diet for each concentration of alcohol (p<0.005). The groups fed the combination of low zinc plus alcohol had 37-52% resorptions, while the animals on the zinc-deficient diet without alcohol or the high zinc diet with alcohol had 0.2% resorptions. Skeletal malformations were related to alcohol concentration but not zinc intake, while external malformations were higher in those maintained on the low zinc-ethanol diet. These results suggest that zinc deficiency potentiated the teratogenic effects of alcohol and that nutritional intervention for alcoholic women during pregnancy might reduce the incidence or severity of fetal alcohol syndrome.

A1  - Barrison I.G.

A1  - Murray-Lyon I.M.
Y1  - 1985//
N2  - Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can produce a spectrum of abnormalities in the developing foetus, ranging from minor retardation of growth to the fully developed 'foetal alcohol syndrome'. This syndrome comprises a constellation of physical and mental defects associated with a characteristic facial appearance that is found in children born to chronic alcoholic women. Although it was thought to be extremely rare in the U.K., several case studies have recently appeared in the literature, and its incidence is probably increasing. In moderately drinking pregnant women increased rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and congenital malformation as well as growth retardation have been reported, though some of these findings await confirmation. It is likely also that certain behavioural abnormalities are consequent on maternal alcoholic intake. The major U.K. finding so far is that consumption of more than 100 g alcohol per week in the early stages of pregnancy is associated with reduced birth weight. There is no doubt that alcohol is teratogenic in laboratory animals and that the effects are dose-related. In humans the threshold dose necessary to produce damage to the foetus and the time in pregnancy that alcohol is particularly likely to have deleterious effects have not yet been established. In the present state of knowledge there are difficulties in recommending safe limits. It is obvious that abstinence before and during pregnancy is the safest course, but one drink a day is unlikely to be harmful. Greater efforts are needed to educate women about the dangers of alcohol consumption in pregnancy.

N2  - Forty childen exposed to variable amounts of alcohol in utero and 40 control children were studied. All mothers had been enrolled in an antenatal programme aiming to identify and reduce alcohol use and abuse during pregnancy. Follow-up was at the median age of 22 (18 to 27) months. A significant reduction in intrauterine growth was seen in children born to alcoholic mothers. Three of six children continuously exposed to high amounts of alcohol throughout fetal life showed growth retardation and physical abnormalities characteristic of fetal alcohol exposure, while infants whose mothers had stopped drinking did not suffer these effects. Psychological or behavioural disturbances were found in all but one of 13 children born to alcoholic mothers. The home environment during the first two years did not compensate for the effects of fetal alcohol exposure. Mothers classified as excessive drinkers but not abusers all reduced their alcohol consumption after the first trimester. Their children did not differ from controls with regard to physical development or behaviour but many were retarded in speech and, in addition had a more unstable family background.

N2  - Heavy alcohol consumption (more than 80 g per day) in pregnancy is associated with the foetal alcohol syndrome. More moderate consumption is reported to result in increased rates of spontaneous abortion, still birth and congenital malformation as well as growth retardation. There may be functional deficits in early childhood. In the light of current knowledge abstinence from alcohol before and during pregnancy is advisable.

T1  - Effects of alcohol on functional development of the auditory pathway in the brainstem of infants and chick embryos
A1  - Pettigrew A.G.
A1  - Hutchinson I.
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - The effects of alcohol on the development of neural function in the auditory pathway of the brainstem have been examined in human neonates and chick embryos. Auditory brainstem evoked responses were recorded in six infants of mothers for whom there was evidence of alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In four of the infants, evoked responses were abnormal, with poorly defined, inconsistent peaks. Neurophysiological and histological studies were done on chick embryos which received a single dose of alcohol early incubation. In most surviving embryos the neuroanatomical arrangement of the auditory nuclei in the brainstem was normal. However, Golgi impregnation revealed abnormalities in the length and structure of the dendrites in nucleus laminaris. Electrically evoked neuronal activity revealed abnormalities of synaptic function and the distribution of nerve terminals. The results indicate that in infants and chick embryos the functional development of the auditory pathway in the brainstem is disrupted by exposure to alcohol. Such early changes in this sensory pathway may contribute to the behavioural and intellectual handicaps associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome.

A1  - Pratt O.E.

Y1  - 1984//
N2  - Fourteen previously reported cases of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) showed anomalies of brain structure varying in severity from microscopic disorganization of tissue structure, or abnormalities in neuronal or glial migration only visible microscopically, to complete or partial agenesis of regions such as the corpus callosum or cerebellum and large neuronal heteropias. The difficulty is illustrated of differentiating this type of damage, lacking in specificity and uniformity, from other syndromes of uncertain aetiology, such as De Lange, DiGeorge and Dubowitz, in at least one of which (DiGeorge syndrome) maternal alcoholism has been implicated. Similar brain damage is also seen in other conditions with known causes. In FAS and syndromes with this type of brain damage, most of the non-CNS features which make the conditions clinically recognizable may well be determined by timing or ancillary factors. Alcohol-related antenatal effects should not be identified to restrictively with FAS but should be considered in any condition of unknown aetiology with disorganization of brain structure and mental retardation.

T1  - Interactions between trace elements and alcohol in rats
A1  - Dreosti I.E.
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - Interactions between ethanol and trace elements are reviewed at two levels. The first concerns the effect of alcohol on the concentration and distribution of certain trace metals in the body; changes are described for copper, iron, manganese, selenium and zinc. The second relates to the possible protection afforded by some trace elements against alcohol-related damage. The significance of maternal zinc to the fetal alcohol syndrome is discussed in the light of evidence that pregnancy outcome in rats after gestational alcoholism is less favourable in zinc-deficient dams than in nutritionally replete animals. Cellular metabolism of ethanol may lead to the generation of damaging superoxide and hydroxyl radicals; several trace elements, notably zinc, manganese, selenium and copper, may function protectively as free radical scavengers and as antioxidants. Evidence is presented of increased lipid peroxidation in zinc-deficient tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats and of enhanced activity of Mn-superoxide dismutase in fetal and adults rats exposed to ethanol.

A1  - Sugathan T.N.
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - Investigators on fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) both clinical and experimental, have generally concentrated attention on chronic alcoholis. In an attempt to elucidate the effects of binge drinking on pre- and postnatal development, single doses of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 ml/g body weight of alcohol solutions (25% v/v of ethanol in saline) were administered intraperitoneally to groups of mice on days 8-12 of gestation. Controls were untreated or starved for 6 h. Fetuses collected on day 18 revealed retardation, fetal mortality and craniofacial and digital malformations. While growth retardation and fetal mortality were dose-dependent, malformations were stage-dependent. The 0.01-ml group exhibited only postaxial polydactyly of the forepaw. The reduction in fetal weight of 0.03-ml groups corresponded well with that of umbilical cord length. Following administration of single doses of 0.01 ml/g of ethanol solution on days 8-12, groups of mice were allowed to deliver. Controls were untreated or pairfed and pair watered. Pups were reared by the respective mothers and their survival and growth were observed till postconception day 71 and thereafter brother/sister matings were carried out. At least one pup in each litter remained extremely stunted and failed to reproduce. No significant differences in mortality, growth rates and reproductive capacity of the rest of the pups were observed. It is concluded that single but heavy doses of ethanol during organogenesis leads to a situation reminiscent of human FAS.

Y1  - 1984//
N2  - A total of 464 children of 323 women registered for alcoholism treatment in Budapest, Hungary, were studied in 1977-1979. A complex epidemiologic investigation was carried out using medical, psychological and anthropological data. The data were evaluated on the basis of a semiquantitative diagnostic scoring system for fetal alcohol syndrome. The score distribution curve for 301 children whose mothers imbibed during pregnancy was statistically significantly different from the score distribution curve for 163 children born to alcoholic mothers who remained abstinent during pregnancy and from the curve for a matched control group of 464 children. A significant difference was also found between the score distribution curves for the latter two groups. Twenty-five children of 301 drinkers (8.3%) scored below -30 points and were said to show typical manifestations of the syndrome. All of the mothers in this group imbibed large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. A further 205 children of 464 alcoholic mothers (44.2%) scored between -30 and -10 points and were diagnosed as having an atypical form of the syndrome. Among the 205 children, 168 were the offspring of 301 drinkers (55.8%) and 37 were the offspring of 163 alcoholic females who were abstinent during pregnancy (22.7%). A stepwise discriminant analysis showed the best discriminating variables - in order of entry into the discriminant functions - to be current weight, nose-upper lip distance, behavioral disturbance (irritability), root of the nose, intelligence quotient, and palpebral fissure. The most important cause of fetal alcohol syndrome is the direct toxic effect of alcohol on the fetus.

A pair-feeding procedure was employed, and an ad lib lab chow control group was also included. At 5, 10, or 15 days of age, pups were infused with a saccharin solution through a cannula implanted in the oral cavity. Half of the pups in each group were then injected with lithium chloride (LiCl), which served as the poisoning agent, and the other half with sodium chloride (NaCl) as a control. Animals were subsequently tested for a conditioned aversion to the saccharin solution. At 15 days of age, all of the pups in the LiCl-poisoned group demonstrated a conditioned taste aversion to the saccharin solution, but the degree of this aversion was less in alcohol-exposed offspring. At 10 days of age, a taste aversion was learned, although it was not as strong as that shown by 15-day-old pups, and it appeared to be learned equally well by all of the prenatal treatment groups. At 5 days of age, there was marginal support for taste aversion learning. Again, it did not interact with prenatal treatment. The ontogenic differences in taste aversion learning exhibited by alcohol-exposed offspring relative to controls are discussed in terms of altered hippocampal development.

T1  - Changes in the term mouse placenta associated with maternal alcohol consumption and fetal growth deficits
A1  - Kennedy L.A.
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - Primiparous mice were fed alcohol in their drinking water as 0%, 10%, 15%, or 20% (v/v) solutions on days 11 through 18 of gestation. Based on blood alcohol levels and on locomotor and health impairments, these treatment groups represent situations of mild, moderate, and severe alcohol abuse. There were significant alcohol-related fetal growth deficits but no increase in fetal mortality or malformation. Placental weight was reduced with increasing alcohol intake. Histologic examination of the placenta revealed an increase in the frequency and severity of intravascular coagulation of maternal erythrocytes in the labyrinth and advanced degenerative changes in the basal zone of alcohol-exposed placentas. These observations suggest that both the vascular and the endocrine functions of the placenta are compromised in alcohol-consuming dams.

Y1  - 1984//
N2  - This paper reports the findings of two studies of children born to alcoholic parents. In the first study follow-up examinations were carried out in 30 children suffering from the fetal alcohol syndrome. In comparison with the initial assessment, the children had improved in their overall psychiatric status and psychological functioning at follow-up after 36 months, although some psychiatric features such as hyperactivity showed no significant change. Progress of development was independent of sex, age, social environment and therapeutic measures. In the second study children with either an alcoholic father or mother or two alcoholic parents and normal controls were compared with regard to symptoms, diagnoses, and past case history. All subjects attended the child psychiatric clinic. The heightened psychiatric risk for all children with alcoholic parents was clearly shown by this study. Based on questionnaire data and psychiatric symptom scores, it was not possible to differentiate between children with alcoholic fathers, alcoholic mothers and those with two alcoholic parents. With regard to psychiatric diagnoses there was a tendency to correlate with maternal alcoholism, but both types of disorders occurred with the same frequency among children with two alcoholic parents.

T1  - Drinking amongst pregnant women: Some initial results from a prospective study
A1  - Plant M.L.
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - A review is presented of the characteristics of the foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). It is noted that in its most extreme from the FAS encompasses both physical and mental abnormalities. Some of the initial results are briefly presented from the first two phases of a Scottish prospective study. This relates to the patterns of alcohol use and misuse of 1008 pregnant women. These data indicate that self-reported alcohol consumption was slightly but significantly correlated with previous obstetric problems. In addition, a minority of the study group, due to their levels of alcohol consumption, may run an increased risk of giving birth to abnormal offspring. It is concluded that on the basis of current evidence those planning or experiencing pregnancy should be advised not to drink.

Y1  - 1984//
N2  - The authors report 7 cases of chondrodysplasia punctata in whom maternal alcohol intoxication was found. Most often, it consisted of chronic and confirmed alcoholism, except for the last case, in which an acute intoxication had occurred at about the 4th or 5th week of pregnancy. Clinically, the appearance of the children was evocative of fetal alcohol syndrome, except in the last case when, in contrast, the facial dysmorphy was very typical of chondrodysplasia punctata. The skeletal anomalies preferentially involve the lower limbs, sometimes the sacrum, and in one case, the dorsal spine. Upper limbs are always spared. The maternal hepatic lesions may be responsible for the skeletal impairment, due to their repercussion on the metabolism of vitamin K. This skeletal impairment would then be close to that induced by treatment with warfarin during pregnancy. It is absolutely necessary to X-ray the lower limbs in cases with fetal alcohol syndrome, so as not to overlook associated bone lesions.

N2  - In 1973, the fetal alcohol syndrome was rediscovered by Jones, Smith, and their collegues. Dysmorphology attributed to fetal alcohol syndrome usually follows substantial alcohol abuse by the mother during pregnancy, but the authors know of no reports of similar presentations in infants born to mothers who have abused solvents while pregnant. The authors know of no reports of fetal damage due to toluene or other solvent abuses, but chronic solvent use after birth is reported to cause brain, bone-marrow, liver, and kidney dysfunction.

N2  - Forty married women in a psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of alcoholism were interviewed to obtain details of their pregnancies and outcome of pregnancies with particular reference to spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, deaths, mental handicap and congenital abnormalities. Forty controls matched by age and with a diagnosis of endogenous depression were also interviewed. No significant differences were found in the fertility, outcome of pregnancy or state of the children. The probable reasons for this are discussed briefly and the introduction contains a review of some of the literature on the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

A1  - Smith D.W.
Y1  - 1978//
N2  - Although heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been widely recognized as a serious risk to the exposed fetus, previous studies have not indicated the magnitude of risk in nonalcoholic populations. As part of a larger study of pregnancy and health, 1,529 unselected pregnant women were interviewed during the 5th month of pregnancy regarding alcohol intake during the month preceding recognition of pregnancy and during the first 5 months of pregnancy. AA scores (average ounces of absolute alcohol/day) were obtained on each mother for the two time periods. At the time of delivery, 82 infants born to the heaviest drinking women (AA>1.0 during either time period or other high-risk drinking patterns) were matched with infants born at the same time whose mothers were light drinkers or abstainers. Each pair of infants was referred for clinical evaluation without knowledge of maternal drinking history. Of 163 infants examined, 11 were judged clinically to show signs of prenatal effect of alcohol on growth and morphogenesis. Nine of these 11 had mothers with AA>1.0. Only 2 of these infants were classified as having the fetal alcohol syndrome, and both of their mothers were very heavy drinkers (AA>5.0 pre-recognition of pregnancy). The other 7 infants, who showed lesser alterations of growth and morphogenesis suggestive of fetal alcohol syndrome, were born to women who reported drinking an average of one ounce or more of absolute alcohol per day in the month before recognition of pregnancy, a period which may actually include the earliest weeks of pregnancy. These results indicate that both moderate and heavy levels of alcohol intake during early pregnancy may result in alterations of growth and morphogenesis in the fetus. The relationship of the observed abnormalities of growth and morphogenesis in infancy to future CNS performance is under investigation.

N2  - The relationship of alcohol consumption by a woman during pregnancy and specific dysmorphic features and mental deficiency in her offspring is becoming increasingly well recognized. Neuropathologic studies of the teratogenic effects of alcohol on the human fetus have, to the knowledge, only been undertaken in the two cases under discussion here. The first infant has already been reported in the literature as having the clinical features of fetal alcohol syndrome. The second infant presented clinically with severe hydrocephalus and a profoundly abnormal neurologic status. The brains of these infants show similar, extensive, and unusual defects of neuronal migration.

The finding of this spectrum of abnormalities raises the possibility of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy. The deleterious effects of alcohol on the developing fetus are emphasized. In view of the high prevalence of alcoholism in this country the fetal syndrome must be regarded as a serious and preventable cause of morbidity.

Y1  - 1978//
N2  - The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), though a recent addition to the diagnostic vocabulary, was recognized in the offspring of alcoholic women at least 250 year ago. The pattern of malformations, characteristic of this syndrome, was not recognized until 1973 at which time Dr. Kenneth Jones noted similar abnormalities in children born to alcoholic mothers. More recently he has determined that the FAS is the third leading cause of mental retardation in Seattle, Washington. As other physicians throughout the country become more aware of the characteristics of this syndrome many children will be identified as displaying the FAS and their mothers can be identified as alcohol abusers. These identifications may lead to the prevention of other affected children being born to such women.

N2  - The potential teratogenic effects of alcohol have been suspected for centuries, but it was not until the work of Lemoine in 1968 and the independent observations of Jones and Smith in 1973 that a distinct, dysmorphic condition associated with maternal, gestational alcoholism was described in medical literature. Yet in spite of the growing awareness of the clinical manifestations of the fetal alcohol syndrome, recognition has been minimal in many areas where alcoholism rates might suggest a sizable number of affected offspring. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to summarize the clinical features of ethyl alcohol teratogenesis to aid in the early recognition of those affected and to facilitate appropriate family preventive counseling and patient management.

N2  - Current data clearly point to an association between chronic maternal alcoholism and serious morphological and developmental abnormalities in the fetus. When these abnormalities are severe the condition is recognizable as the fetal alcohol syndrome. However, this represents only the most severe end of a spectrum of abnormalities, some of which may be found in a proportion of infants exposed to lesser amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol is an avoidable hazard for the fetus, but only through increased awareness by the medical community and improved education of the lay public may we hope to control this problem.

The signs consist of a decrease of body length and weight beginning at birth, microcephalus, marked decrease of intelligence and narrowing of the palpebral fissure. Frequently congenital cardiac defects are found and sometimes anomalies of the genitalia and other malformations. Experience so far indicates a causal relationship between considerable alcohol abuse of mothers during pregnancy and intra uterine fetal damage. The prognosis is poor; in severe cases of chronic alcoholism interruption of pregnancy should be seriously considered.
