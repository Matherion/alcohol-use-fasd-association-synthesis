N2  - Women who consume alcohol during pregnancy are at risk of giving birth to children with a pattern of physical, developmental, and functional defects collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Approximately 40,000 infants in the United States are born with FASD per year, costing an estimated $6 billion in health, education, and social services. Ethanol is the main constituent of consumable alcohol and is the addictive neuroactive compound that causes FASD. However, therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of FASD are not available. While prenatal ethanol exposure affects development of almost all organs, the brain and craniofacial features show the most severe defects. The cerebellum is particularly sensitive to the effects of ethanol during development. Our studies have demonstrated that high dose of ethanol (blood ethanol concentration 80 mM) induces apoptosis in the external granule layer of cerebellum, and inhibits the differentiation and reduces the survival of cerebellar granule cells. At this concentration, ethanol also increases oxidative stress in the cerebellum and in cerebellar granule cells. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin polyphenolic compound found in various plants, including grapes, berries and peanuts. It exhibits a wide range of pharmacological effects, including prevention of heart disorders, blocking of lipoprotein oxidation, free radical scavenging, prevention of apoptosis, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. It mimics caloric restriction by extending the lifespan of different organisms via activation of deacetylases from the sirtuin family. Recent studies have shown that resveratrol exhibits neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress. Using a rodent model of FASD we further demonstrate that resveratrol prevents ethanol-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in the external granule layer of cerebellum and in cerebellar granule cells. It also prevents harmful ethanol effects on the survival and differentiation of cerebellar granule cells. Together our studies demonstrate that resveratrol may be a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of FASD.

N2  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of comprehensive community-based interventions to reduce fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in two populations from the Northern Cape Province in South Africa. Methods: Changes in the prevalence of FASD, and in maternal knowledge and drinking behaviour, were assessed in De Aar and Upington, Northern Cape Province, before and after an intensive community-level intervention. Eight community workers implemented educational activities to raise awareness of the risks of maternal drinking and to alter community norms about alcohol use in pregnancy. All children were examined by two dysmorphologists at 9 months of age and those with evidence of FASD were reassessed at 18 months. Neuropsychometrists evaluated infant neurodevelopment. Structured maternal interviews with FASD cases and matched controls determined patterns of alcohol use and knowledge about FASD. Results: At baseline, 809 children were evaluated, 751 after intervention. FASD prevalence pre-intervention was 8.9% (72/809) and 5.7% post intervention (43/751; p =.02). In multivariate logistic regression, controlling for maternal age and ethnicity, FASD prevalence was 0.73 fold lower post-intervention than pre-intervention (95%CI=0.58-0.90; p =.004). Dysmorphology scores reduced from 4 at baseline (IQR=2-7) to 3 (IQR=1-6; p =.002). After intervention, a large proportion of women reported having received educational messages, levels of knowledge about alcohol increased and some changes were detected in attitudes to drinking. Conclusion: Comprehensive community-level interventions might reduce the burden of FASD in heavily-affected areas of South Africa, by about 30%. This, the first study ever to document the effectiveness of FASD prevention using clinical outcomes, suggests that comprehensive community-level services should be implemented in similar settings to reduce this very common, oft neglected, disorder.

N2  - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Many women drink during their childbearing years as well as use ineffective contraception. FAS-PACE Stepped Care Intervention (FSCI) utilized the Project CHOICES brief intervention model in implementing this "research to practice" model into 4 public health settings. In addition, FSCI utilized Case Management (CM) practices in two CM tiers. FSCI implementation goals were to prevent alcohol-exposed births by reducing alcohol use among women of childbearing age and/or increasing contraceptive knowledge/utilization. The purpose was to develop, implement, and evaluate population-based and targeted prevention programs for FASD Prevention. The project measured five main outcomes of the FSCI: 1. Reduce alcohol use among women of childbearing age 2. Reduce alcohol use among pregnant women. 3. Increase effective contraception 4. Decreased unintended pregnancies 5. Decrease stress levels The methods used were a multi-point, 3-Step, longitudinal design. The sample included 535 women between the ages of 12 and 44 who were sexually active (SA) risk drinking (RD) and were ineffectively using contraception or pregnant. Results: FAS-PACE intervention methods significantly reduced the number of women who self-reported binge drinking and increased the number of women who used effective contraception in all three interventions. The stress levels were reduced in the case-managed Personal Skills and Personal Support interventions (p <.000). Narrative Summaries: FAS-PACE consisted of a stepped care intervention utilizing a continuum of services from brief intervention to 6 month intervention and to intensive 3 year intervention. Personal CHOICES program (brief intervention) had 244 women who received services. At the three-month follow-up, 68 women were contacted and of those, 34 (50%) no longer participated in binge drinking activities. At the six-month follow-up, 42 of 70 previous binge drinkers reported no longer drinking at risk levels. Forty women reported not using contraception effectively at intake with 24 doing so at the six-month follow-up. Personal SKILLS (up to 6 month intervention) program resulted in women reducing binge drinking at the (p <.05) level. The conclusion reached was that despite poor follow-up in this commonly transient population the FSCI program resulted in decreased risk drinking and increased contraception use among participants.

N2  - Due to the physical and psychological consequences of in utero alcohol exposure, it is imperative that caregivers have evidence-based interventions that lead to a decrease in alcohol use during pregnancy. Interventions based on theoretically active components of behavior change and motivation have the potential to decrease prenatal alcohol use and, consequentially, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. This study determined the effectiveness of a Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention in decreasing prenatal drinking. The influence of the MI intervention on pregnant women's drinking behaviors as mediated by Self-Determination Theory's concepts of basic psychological needs and autonomous motivations determined what mechanisms of the intervention evoked a change in behavior. Of 171 pregnant women who reported previous year alcohol use, 67 consented to participate with random assignment to an MI Intervention (MII) group or a No-MI Intervention Comparison (NIC) group. After receiving education regarding risks of prenatal alcohol use, both groups were assessed for alcohol usage, levels of basic psychological needs, and autonomous motivations at baseline and 4-6 week follow-up. The MII group received the intervention following the baseline assessments. Fifty-six pregnant women completed all study procedures. Structural equation modeling determined the effectiveness of the intervention in decreasing pregnant women's drinking behaviors as mediated by basic psychological needs and autonomous motivations over the 4-6 week period. Two significant paths were found between the type of intervention group and (i) changes in number of drink days per week (p <.05) and (ii) gains in levels of basic psychological needs (p <.05) with the NIC group reporting greater changes in both at follow-up. The MI intervention provided by this study was not found effective in decreasing pregnant women's drinking behaviors during pregnancy. Confounders, such as the standard education provided to both groups by the researcher who was trained in MI, may have provided an additional intervention that decreased the women's drinking behaviors in both groups. Decreased variability in levels of reported drinking, basic psychological needs, and autonomous motivations reported by the two groups at baseline may also have affected the results. This study provided the groundwork for future interventions that will assist pregnant women to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Despite efforts to increase public awareness and explicit recommendations to avoid alcohol while pregnant, rates of prenatal alcohol consumption have not declined in the last decade. Healthcare providers that interact regularly with the population at risk, have the utmost potential of preventing or changing this abusive behavior. Therefore, we aimed in this study to determine if obstetricians, family practitioners and pediatricians are aware of current recommendations, are well informed about fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and whether healthcare providers' own bias to alcohol consumption affected how information was conveyed to their patients. Methods: Staff, fellow, and resident physicians within the Cleveland Clinic system were surveyed using a web-based survey tool. The survey consisted of 38 questions on practice characteristics, knowledge of FASD, awareness of the risks of prenatal alcohol consumption, counseling practice, comfort level discussing FASD, social/moral attitudes regarding alcohol consumption, and demographics. Results: 12% of physicians felt that 1-3 drinks per week is safe while trying to become pregnant. Most physicians felt it was unsafe to consume alcohol while pregnant, but 10% felt that it is safe to consume alcohol during the third trimester. About a quarter of physicians were uncomfortable about discussing alcohol consumption with their patients and half of them stated that they are not current with the literature on prenatal alcohol exposure. More than 25% of physicians felt that they were not adequately trained to counsel their patients on the dangers prenatal alcohol exposure and more than half felt that their colleagues were not well educated on the subject. More male physicians felt that women who consume alcohol while pregnant should be subject to legal penalties, while more female physicians and physicians who have children felt that women who consume alcohol while pregnant are solely responsible for their actions if they continue to drink after being counseled. Finally, 90% of physicians felt that they have a professional responsibility to protect the developing embryo from alcohol consumption. Conclusion: From the results obtained we have concluded that obstetricians, pediatricians, and family practitioners need to be better informed on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. With this knowledge they can then convey this information to women of childbearing age and ultimately prevent FASD.

N2  - Alcohol drinking during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, with fetal alcohol syndrome being the most severe form of this disorder showing a collection of birth defects which include facial dysmorphology and neurological dysfunctions. Recently, it has been suggested that alcohol-mediated changes in microRNA profiles may account for the deficits associated with fetal alcohol exposure. MicoRNAs (miRNA) are non-coding RNAs approximately 21-23 nucleotides in length that are able to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding to target mRNA and either causing transcript degradation or halting translation. In this study, a zebrafish embryo model was used to examine an early alcohol exposure regimen during gastrulation on specific 2 miRNAs: miR-430a and let-7h. In early development of the zebrafish, miR-430 has been shown to regulate morphogenesis, clearance of maternal mRNAs, and brain rescue in MZdicer mutants; and let-7 is known to be involved in cell migration in the nervous system development. The zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 0.32, or 2% (w/v) alcohol (ethanol) beginning at 3.5 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and the treatment lasted for 4 hours during the gastrulation stage of the zebrafish embryo development. These developing embryos were evaluated for morphological alterations at 48 hpf and were sacrificed for miRNA analysis. MiRNA was isolated using the mirVana Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real time RT-PCR was used to verify the quantitative changes in miRNA expression with SYBR green based RT-PCR using MyiQ single-color RT-PCR detection system (BioRad). The RT-PCR data was normalized to U6 snRNA. The results showed that zebrafish embryos exposed to 2% alcohol exhibited significant morphological alterations, such as cardiac edema and a curved vertebral column. However, such defects were not observed in embryos exposed to 0.32% alcohol. The miRNA expression data showed that alcohol treatment did not alter the expression of let-7h or miR-430a. Nonetheless, the data showed a trend in decreasing mean deltaCT in the 2% alcohol treated group suggesting an increase in the expression of miR-430a, and a similar pattern of trend was found in the let-7h analysis.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure often results in neurodevelopmental deficit and growth retardation constituting phenotypes of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The type and extent of expression of these phenotypes following prenatal alcohol exposure depends on multifactorial environmental and genetic interactions, which are not well understood. We previously reported that mouse embryos exposed to alcohol (88 mM) at the stage of neurulation cause growth retardation and abnormal development of embryos with two major phenotypes - neural tube closed (Alc-NTC) and neural tube opened (Alc-NTO). We further demonstrated significant differences in DNA methylation between the Alc-NTO and Alc-NTC phenotypes, including a 10-fold greater number of methylated genes on Chromosome 10 and X in Alc-NTO than Alc-NTC (Liu et al., 2009). Here we show that genes on the X chromosome display increased DNA methylation and cluster together, both physically and functionally. Genomic location analysis showed that the 178 genes reside in 8 separate clusters within a chromosomal band of 0.5-3 cM: bands XqA1.1 (0.5 cM, 14 genes from Ppp1r3f-Ftsj1), XqA1.3 (0.25 cM, 7 genes from Ndufb11-Zfp182), XqA5 (1 cM, 6 genes from 3830403N18Rik-Zic3), XqA7.3 (1.5 cM, 17 genes from Nsdhl-Brcc3), XqD (2 cM, 10 genes from Ercc6l-Atp7a), XqF1 (1 cM, 9 genes from Bex2-Il1rapl2), XqF3 (2.5 cM, 13 genes from Pfkb1-Magea1) and XqF5 (1.5 cM, 9 genes from Ap1s2-Egf16). Ingenuity analysis further revealed that these gene clusters are closely related in function, including in cell cycle, cell death, cellular growth and proliferation, nervous system development, cancer, and cardiovascular system development. Analysis of gene expression using Affymetrix microarrays supported an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression for some genes. For example, Ftsj1 and Zic3, which are specifically responsible for the developmental disorders X-linked mental retardation and neural tube defects, showed increased methylation. The current study demonstrates that DNA methylation may serve as both a marker to predict neural tube defect and as a mechanism underlying abnormal gene function in fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Background: Heavy drinking during pregnancy is the cause of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), the leading known cause of mental retardation. L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1), a protein critical for promotion of neurite outgrowth is considered a major target for ethanol toxicity in FASD. Our previous studies suggest that ethanol inhibits L1 mediated neurite outgrowth by increasing the fraction of L1 within lipid rafts (LR). Objective: Our objective in this study is to determine whether the effect of ethanol is on the LR or on L1. We utilize L1 KO mice to prepare cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) that had only LR but no L1. Thus, exposure of these cells to ethanol only exposes LR, and not L1. Exposure of wild type (WT) CGN exposes both L1 and some LR. Our hypothesis is that if LR are the target of ethanol, then ethanol exposed LR (present in lysates of KO CGN) mixed with unexposed L1 (present in lysates of WT CGN) contains more L1 than unexposed KO CGN mixed with unexposed WT CGN. If L1 is the target, then ethanol exposed L1 (present in lysates of WT CGN) redistributes to unexposed LR (present in lysates of KO CGN). Methods: CGN from L1 KO and WT postnatal day 6 mice are cultured overnight separately. For ethanol exposure, CGN are incubated in 25 mM ethanol for 1 hour. Neurons are washed free of ethanol, suspended in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer at a ratio of L1 KO:WT 4:1 (to dilute the LR in WT) and mixed on ice for 1 hour. LR are isolated from the mixed lysates using sucrose density gradients. Ten fractions are collected and LR containing fractions are pooled (LR) and the remaining fractions are pooled (non-LR). Western blotting is performed to identify L1 in LR and non-LR. L1 is quantified by densitometry and the percent of total L1 in lipid rafts (%L1 in LR) is calculated (pixels in LR)/(pixels in LR + non-LR). Results: The %L1 in LR are: 7%,-/-KO/WT; 12.4%,-/+ KO/WT; 24.5%, +/-KO/WT; 22.7%, +/+ KO/WT. Only when the LR are exposed to ethanol does the %L1 in LR increase. Conclusion: This data may demonstrate that ethanol alters lipid rafts thereby increasing L1 within them.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure leads to long-lasting deficits in learning and memory. Using a rat model, we have previously shown that choline supplementation during early development can attenuate some fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), including deficits in learning and memory. Choline is a quatranary amine, classified as a nutrient essential for human health. It acts as a methyl donor, and subserves various signaling pathways, including its role as a precursor for platelet-activating factor, sphingosylphosphocholine, diacylglycerol, and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It is not known how choline is able to mitigate alcohol-related learning deficits; however, identifying these mechanisms could contribute to the identification of additional treatments for FASD. It is hypothesized that developmental alcohol exposure induces learning and memory deficits, in part, by altering cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus, a CNS structure well-known for its role in memory function. To test this hypothesis, quantitative autoradiography was used to measure the hippocampal density of M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes that bind acetylcholine. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were orally intubated with ethanol (5.25 mg/kg/day) from postnatal days (PD) 4 to 9, a period of brain development equivalent to the human 3rd trimester; controls received sham intubations. From PD 4 to 30, subjects were injected s.c. with choline chloride (100 mg/kg/day) or saline vehicle. After behavioral testing from PD 31 to 33, brain tissue was collected on PD 35 for autoradiographic analysis. Data from the binding studies indicate that early developmental alcohol exposure increases the expression of M1 and M2 receptors. Furthermore, choline supplementation attenuates the ethanol-related increase of muscarinic receptors to a level not significantly different from that of control subjects; choline had no effect on muscarinic receptors among controls. These data suggest that perinatal alcohol exposure can cause long-lasting changes in the development of the cholinergic system; specifically, it may lead to reductions in cholinergic release and consequent upregulation of muscarinic receptor expression. This study further shows that choline supplementation may be attenuate alcoholrelated behavioral changes by normalizing cholinergic function, possibly by increasing the availability of choline for acetylcholine synthesis.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a wide range of abnormalities including defects in stress axis function. One of the possible mechanisms of alcohol's effect is epigenetic reprogramming causing abnormal DNA methylation in the key genes regulating the stress response such as proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene. In previous work we have demonstrated the hypermethylation of the promoter region of the POMC gene and consequent decrease in the POMC gene expression in the hypothalamus of rats prenatally exposed to alcohol. Also, the affected rats showed significant increase in stress axis response manifested by the elevated level of plasma corticosterone. In order to verify that the alcohol effect is mediated by the methylation changes we supplemented maternal diet with the methylation donor choline. The data of pregnant rats fed with liquid diet containing ethanol or choline-supplemented diet containing ethanol were compared with the rats fed a control diet with and without choline. The methylation status of the proximal POMC promoter was determined by Real-Time PCR using the probes specific to the methylated and unmethylated state of the promoter region. The stress axis response was determined by measuring basal and LPS-induced corticostrone levels in plasma. The choline supplementation reversed the aberrant DNA methylation in the hypothalamic POMC promoter and normalized the POMC gene expression in the offspring. It also restored the plasma corticosterone level and stress hyperresponse back to the norm. These results show support that an aberrant methyl metabolism plays an important role in the epigenetic changes caused by fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been shown to cause abnormality in stress axis function in the offspring. Fetal alcohol exposed rat offspring shows increased corticosterone production and the hormone response to immune challenge such as lipopolysaccaride (LPS). However, it is not known whether these abnormal changes of basal and LPS-stimulated corticosterone levels is transmitted to next generations. To determine the trangenerational effect, we exposed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats to alcohol during gestational day 7 and 21 and produced F1 offspring. Then both male and female F1 rats were mated with the animals born from a different dam but fed a similar diet to obtain the F2 generation. A third generation (F3) was derived from a cross of the 2 similarly treated F2 rats from different dams. These rats were used to determine the basal and LPS-stimulated corticosterone levels in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the fetal alcohol exposure increased basal plasma level of corticosterone in both male and female rats during adulthood. Additionally, the LPS-induced corticosterone level was much higher in alcohol-fed than in control-fed rats. Interestingly, a higher corticosterone response to LPS was observed in the alcohol-fed female rats than in alcohol-fed male rats. The increased basal and LPS-induced corticosterone levels in alcohol-fed male offspring persisted for both F2 and F3 generations. However, alcohol-fed female offspring showed normal basal and LPS-induced corticosterone levels in F2 and F3 generation. These results suggest that fetal alcohol exposure increases stress axis hyperresponse both in male and females offspring. Furthermore, because the offspring (F1) and its germ cells (F2) were exposed to alcohol during development via F0 female, the persistence of alcohol effects in the F3 male but not in the F3 female indicates that the transgenerational effect of fetal alcohol is transmitted via male germ line.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure often results in neurodevelopmental deficit and growth retardation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The penetration and outcome of the alcohol exposure however is depending on multifactorial environment and genetic interaction which is not well understood. Here, we demonstrated that three strains of mice, C57BL/6N (C57), DBA2 (D2), and 129, have great scale of heterogeneous response to same dose of alcohol at same embryonic stage. All strains of mice were analyzed in whole embryo culture at gestation day 8.25 (E8.25) with or without alcohol administration at 88 mM for 6 hours in the initial stage. The embryos harvested two days from initial culture were evaluated for growth rate using Van Farby scoring system and for apoptotic marker caspase 3 staining. We found that forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, heart, optic vesicle, caudal neural tube, and hindlimbs of C57BL/6J were delayed in growth, while forebrain and optic vesicle did in D2, and none in 129, as compared to their controls respectively. Caspase3, an intermediate apoptotic marker, staining showed that large number of caspase 3-immunostaining (im) cells were found in parietal forebrain, midbrain, rhombencephalon, as well as in none-neural regions e.g. head, 1st and 2nd brachial arches in alcohol treated C57 embryos, only a few were found in corresponding regions of their controls. In contract, only a small number of caspase 3-im cells were found in either the alcohol treated or the controls of the D2 embryo. Similar caspase 3-im scale to D2 were found in 129 embryos, except minor increase in the dorsal optic vesicle, and VII & VIII cranial ganglia, and somites of the alcohol-treated. These observations indicated that mouse strains with different genetic background were response to alcohol in distinctive different manner. The alcohol-resistant strains, D2 and 129 may have genetic or epigenetic makeup, which differ to C57 and were protected against alcohol insult.

N2  - Alcohol exposure during fetal development poses a risk of subsequent neuroanatomical abnormalities in the brain. Human MRI studies indicate that fetal alcohol exposure can cause developmental abnormalities of the corpus callosum, and that certain patterns of morphological abnormalities of the corpus callosum may be related to specific learning disability profiles. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in midsagittal area of the corpus callosum would be evident in an ovine model of fetal alcohol exposure, in which pregnant ewes received IV infusions of alcohol (1.75 g/kg) or saline in a 3-day-on/4-day-off weekly binge pattern. Lambs from normal control, saline, first-trimester-only alcohol-exposure, and all-three-trimester alcohol-exposure groups were killed at 5 months age; brains were fixed in situ via intra-carotid perfusion. Brains were extracted and transected along the mid-sagittal plane, and both forebrain hemispheres were placed sagittal-side down on a clear surface supported at a fixed distance above a digital camera. Brains were then illuminated and photographed from below, at the same zoom level and fixed distance between the camera and brain, yielding digital images for unbiased comparison of callosal area. Image analysis software was used to precisely outline the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum in each hemisphere, with care taken to discriminate between white matter of the corpus callosum and white matter of the fornix. The cross-sectional outline was subdivided to obtain standardized measures (Witelson 1989) of length, total area, and areas of seven regional subdivisions (rostrum, genu, rostral body, anterior midbody, posterior midbody, isthmus and splenium). Although preliminary analyses with limited statistical power failed to reveal significant differences between the prenatal treatment groups, results suggest a tendency toward smaller total mid-sagittal areas in brains from alcohol-exposed lambs. Further development of these methods with more subjects may permit modeling of human alcohol-induced callosal dysmorphology in the sheep.

N2  - Introduction: Although prenatal alcohol exposure is often associated with a unique pattern of dysmorphic facial features (e.g., midfacial hypoplasia, short palpebral fissures), little is known about longitudinal changes in these features over the course of development. In a Cape Town, South African sample with variable alcohol exposure, we examined whether facial anthropometric measurements changed over a 4-year interval, and if facial measurements predicting alcohol exposure remained consistent across time. Methods: Data on 22 standard anthropometric landmarks were obtained from 3D facial images. The initial sample consisted of 15 children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 15 with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (HE), and 15 born to alcohol abstinent mothers (controls). 16 standard anthropometric features were measured at an average age of 5.0 years and 4 years later at 9.0 years. Logistic regression was used to identify a set of anthropometric measurements that optimally classified the sample at each time point. ANOVA was employed to compare relative growth of these features between the groups. Results: At both ages, lower facial depth alone distinguished FAS from controls (Age 5: sensitivity=86%, specificity=83%; Age 9: sensitivity=87%, specificity=93%). Correct classification was substantially lower at both ages when comparing HE and controls. At age 5, bitragal width was the only predictor with 70% sensitivity and 79% specificity. At age 9, nasal bridge length was the only predictor with 60% sensitivity and specificity. The FAS group demonstrated more relative growth compared to the HE group for outer canthal, palpebral fissure (p = 0.07), nasal length, lower facial height and total facial height (p = 0.023). The HE group exhibited more relative growth compared to the controls for minimal frontal, bizygomatic, bigonial, and inner canthal widths; upper, mid, and lower facial depths, and ear length. Conclusion: Anthropometric measures that correctly identify prenatal alcohol exposure in a homogeneous age group differ across age, which could be partially due to "catch-up" growth. Furthermore, different measures provide optimal classification when distinguishing FAS or HE from controls. These results support the clinical observation that FAS facial features become more subtle as the affected individuals age.

N2  - Dysmorphic facial features are one potential consequence of exposure to alcohol during human fetal development. Facial dysmorphology is a requisite feature for diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and is presently the most well-accepted means for identifying children with FAS. The purpose of this study was to assess whether prenatal alcohol exposure induces facial dysmorphology in our ovine model of prenatal alcohol exposure, by applying standard anthropometric facial measurements that have been shown to successfully classify FAS in a clinical sample. Time-pregnant ewes were assigned to one of four treatment groups: normal control, saline control, alcohol exposed during first trimester (gestational day [GD] 4-41), or alcohol exposure during all three trimesters (GD 4-132). Alcohol was administered as a 1.75 g/kg IV dose (infused over 60 minutes) in a 3-day-on/4-day off binge pattern, and 17 standard anthropometric features were measured on postnatal day 4. All data from the alcohol exposed lambs were combined for the current analysis. ANOVA was used to test if the 17 measurements were different between treatment groups and logistic regression was employed to identify a set of anthropometric measurements that optimally classified the sample. Only two measurement means (nasal bridge and lower facial height) were different between the alcohol-exposed and normal control groups. However, logistic regression successfully classified the alcohol-exposed from normal controls (sensitivity=81%, specificity=78%), based on bigonial width, lower facial depth, and nasal bridge length. Classification of alcohol-exposed from saline controls demonstrated approximately the same sensitivity but less accurate specificity (44%). These results demonstrate that the identification of prenatal alcohol exposure in this sheep model is effective using standard anthropometric facial measures, even when the single measurement averages were not different between the treatment groups. These findings provide evidence that the sheep model exhibits a facial dysmorphology phenotype, in addition to the previously demonstrated neuroanatomical and neurobehavioral deficits, confirming that this ovine model of prenatal alcohol exposure includes the key phenotypes of FAS.

N2  - Diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is difficult due to lack of distinct facial dysmorphic feature described in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Study in humans, using anthropomorphic facial measurements has begun to discriminate subtle difference against maternal drinking history. A parallel mouse facial model is also being studied with definitive information on dose and timing of alcohol exposure. In this study, we further study the craniofacial bone facial dysmorphology over time with goal of better identification of FASD phenotypes. Alcohol induced craniofacial bone dysmorphology in postnatal day 7 (P7) and 21 (P21) C57BL/6J mice were longitudinally studied, using micro-CT scanning and 3D linear measurements. Pregnant dams were administered liquid diet or ad libitum chow from embryonic day 7 (E7) to (E16). Four treatment groups were examined (CHOW, ALC-PF [prepregnancy alcohol and pregnancy isocaloric pair-fed], PF-PF [pre-and pregnancy pair-fed], and ALC-ALC [pre-and pregnancy alcohol]). All delivered pups were culled to 6/litter and surrogate fostered. Three dimensional microCT imaging was performed at P7 and P21, and 15 anthropometric 3D linear measures were collected. Data was examined by ANAOVA, and Logistic Regression to discern features that predict alcohol exposure with high accuracy. At P7, two width measurements (minimal frontal and inner canthal) showed significant alcohol induced differences comparing Alc-Alc to PF controls. Using Logistic Regression, at P7, 74% of the ALC-ALC mice vs 83% of the PF controls (PF-PF, and ALC-PF) were correctly predicted using two width measurements (inner canthal and minimal frontal). Similar prediction rates were achieved at P21 but with three different widths (minimal frontal, bigonial, inner orbital width). Current data indicates that alcohol induced craniofacial bone dysmorphology provides further information either independently or in conjunction with facial feature analysis to diagnosis for FASD. Further studies are in progress to delineate regional bone deformation in consequence of alcohol exposure.

N2  - Introduction: Craniofacial bone dysmorphology is an important but under explored diagnostic feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). To further understand the developmental consequences of alcohol exposure, this study was designed with the following objective: Identify the effect of alcohol exposure on underlying cranial facial bone growth in a mouse model, while taking into consideration the individual volume variation of the craniofacial region characterized by the centroid size of 17 manually labeled cranial facial bone landmarks. Methods: Three treatments of C57BL/6J dams, CHOW, ALC-PF (pre-pregnancy alcohol exposure and at-pregnancy isocaloric pair-fed), and ALC-ALC (pre-and at-pregnancy alcohol exposure) were studied. The Micro-CT scan yielded volumetric data for each mouse sample with 40x40x40 um3 voxel spacing. Pups born to all treated dams were scanned at postnatal 7 day (P7) and at P21 for longitudinal studies of craniofacial bone development. Using Amira Software,17 landmarks on the craniofacial bone surfaces were defined and the frontal, parietal, occipital and jaw bones were segmented. The centroid size of 17 landmarks and the volumes of the four bones were computed and analyzed using general linear model with SPSS 17.0 to examine effect of alcohol disposure on craniofacial bone development. Results: At P21, the most prominent patterns appeared when the centroid size was not involved as a covariate: ALC-ALC showed significantly less bone development (p < 0.001) in frontal, parietal and occipital regions than ALC-PF and CHOW, while the latter two groups did not differ in frontal, pariental or jaw bone volumes. At P7, group differences were detected by fewer measures. The centroid size at both P7 and P21 stages was significantly smaller (p < 0.003) in ALC-ALC than ALC-PF and CHOW, but was similar between the ALC-PF and CHOW groups. Conclusion: These results validate our hypothesis that at-pregnancy alcohol exposure has a significant impact on reducing craniofacial bone development after birth. And, the retardation of the craniofacial bone growth was exacerbated by age. Further studies will help delineate effects of quantity and frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure on craniofacial bone dysmorphology to enable diagnosis of FASD.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which includes a spectrum of cognitive, behavioral, and structural developmental deficits. Diagnosis of Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the more severe form of FASD, depends, in part on a distinct set of abnormal facial features (smooth philtrum, short palpebral fissures, thin upper vermilion). FASD children often exhibit no, or a subset, of facial features and clinical diagnosis is not reliable. Resent studies using 2D morphometry and discrimant analysis using C57BL/6 mouse embryos demonstrated how alcohol exposure produces a specific set of abnormal facial features that may assist in diagnosis of FASD with partial phenotypes. To improve facial recognition methods in a mouse model we analyzed facial dysmorphology using a 3D volume rendering methodology. We exposed C57BL/B6J dams (B6J) with alcohol (Alc) consisting of 4.8% (v/v) in a liquid diet for 16 days pre-pregnancy, chow and water diet during mating, and the alcohol liquid diet reinstated on gestational days 7(E7) to E17. Treatment controls included a pair-fed (PF) group and an ad lib access to chow and water (Chow). We established a computational analysis of facial feature using a detection algorithm to test the divergence of facial dysmorphology between treatment groups. Using micro-video digitization, high-resolution mouse micro-video facial images were acquired for a total of 30 mouse E17 embryos from each treatment group. The digitalized images were collected from a series of fixed camera angles with images taken from a sequence of 100 camera angles, which were stacked into a video volume. Using a feature extraction approach and video volume for classification of embryonic mouse images with treatments separated into alcohol exposed and normal (control) groups, we show prediction results for the 30 Leave-One-Out cross validation test with an overall classification rate is 86.75%. Visualization of the feature points, selected by the feature analysis algorithm, on the surface mapped to the original mouse shows that critical areas of the face that contribute to the alcohol effect focus on the eye and the mid-face regions. We suggest that 3D modeling of alcohol exposed mouse embryos will assist in defining facial features in FASD where partial dysmorphology subsets can be used to predict alcohol exposure with significant accuracy.

N2  - Prevention of alcohol use is difficult thus therapies that ameliorate alcohol's damage are desirable. The severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) increases with parity, implying the depletion of a protective maternal factor. Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency and causes neurodevelopmental deficits that parallel FASD. We hypothesized that moderate maternal ID exacerbates alcohol-induced associative learning impairments and tested this in offspring of iron-sufficient (IS) or ID rat dams using cerebellumdependent eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC) and hippocampus-and amygdala-dependent fear conditioning. We exposed pups to 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg/day alcohol during the brain growth spurt via gastric gavage (postnatal days 4-9; P4-9). ID dams had a subclinical ID and were not anemic. In contrast, ID offspring were anemic at P10 and had normalized with dietary repletion by adolescence. During adolescence, ID significantly exacerbated alcohol-induced associative learning deficits measured using ECC. Alcohol-exposed ID pups had values for CR frequency and amplitude that were~30% of the responses in ID-only or alcohol-only animals. In addition, the ID-alcohol combination significantly impaired outcomes in cued and contextual fear conditioning. However, the ID-alcohol combination did not affect motor coordination. To determine whether cellular losses were associated with the ECC behavioral deficits we examined cerebellar proliferation and apoptosis at P10. ID and alcohol did not alter proliferation; however, ID significantly increased alcohol-induced apoptosis 2-fold in comparison to IS animals of the same alcohol dose. This is the first study to show that subclinical maternal ID profoundly and specifically exacerbates alcohol's effects on associative learning in the offspring. We propose that maternal iron status is an important modulator of fetal neurobehavioral outcome following alcohol exposure. Increased monitoring and treatment of ID in at-risk pregnancies may ameliorate damage to the fetus.

N2  - Alcohol dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of alcohol. Expression of 3 alleles at the ADH1B locus results in enzymes that differ in turnover rate and affinity for alcohol. The ADH1B*3 allele, which appears to be unique to African Americans, is associated with more rapid alcohol metabolism than the more prevalent ADH1B*1 allele. We and others have previously demonstrated that the presence of at least one maternal ADH1B*3 allele confers a protective effect against alcohol teratogenicity in African American infants and children (McCarver et al.,1997; Jacobson et al., 2006; Arfsten et al., 2004; but cf. Stoler et al., 2002). This study was conducted to determine whether the maternal ADH1B*3 allele continues to be protective in alcohol-exposed individuals during adolescence. 186 adolescents and 167 mothers participating in the 14-year follow-up of the Detroit Longitudinal Cohort had been genotyped for ADH1B alleles. The frequencies of the ADH1B*3 allele were 17.6% in the mothers and 21.0% in the adolescents, which are consistent with the 22% expected for the African American population. Confirming previous studies, prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with reduced head circumference and increased attention problems and externalizing behaviors in adolescents born to mothers with two ADH1B*1 alleles but not in those whose mothers had at least one ADH1B*3 allele. By contrast, the presence of an ADH1B*3 in the adolescent did not protect against any fetal alcohol-related deficits at this age. Moreover, the presence of at least one ADH1B*3 allele in the adolescent was associated with alcohol-related deficits in executive function and arithmetic calculation that were not seen in adolescents with two ADH1B*1 alleles. No differences in pregnancy alcohol intake were found in mothers with the ADH1B*3 allele. This study demonstrates that the protective effects of the maternal ADH1B*3 allele continue to be evident during adolescence and suggests that differences in alcohol metabolism genes may help account for individual differences in the vulnerability of offspring to the effects of fetal alcohol exposure. The protective effect of the maternal ADH1B*3 allele may be due to the more rapid metabolism of alcohol that it confers on the mother, which presumably results in a reduction of the peak blood alcohol concentration to which the fetus is exposed during each drinking episode.

N2  - Maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can induce a range of behavioural and cognitive deficits in offspring, which are collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). There are significant delays in motor development and sensory-motor skills in children with FASD, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these deficits are poorly understood. The goal of this research project is to test the hypothesis that the Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movements (KINARM) will serve as an effective tool for identifying and measuring specific, neurologically-based motor deficits in children with FASD. These deficits will be revealed through investigation of multi-joint upper limb movements during the performance of sensory-motor tasks (reaching and arm positionmatching tasks). Children (21 FASD; 86 Controls, aged 6 to 17 years, male and female) performed two separate tasks: (i) a visually-guided reaching task with fingertip feedback only; and (ii) an arm position-matching task in the absence of visual feedback. Children with FASD significantly differed from controls in many reaching task outcome measures, specifically those measures related to the initial motor response (distance and direction errors), corrective responses, and total movement time. In particular, exceptionally large effect sizes were observed for outcome measures related to the first (initial) movement (e.g. distance and direction error), and the total movement path length relative to the optimal path length. In the position-matching task, children with FASD constricted the spatial workspace of the subjectcontrolled arm relative to the robot-controlled arm in both the horizontal and vertical axes. The results suggest that children with FASD have difficulty integrating sensory information into planned motor movements. The KINARM is a promising research tool that may be used to assess motor control deficits in children affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) describes the continuum of adverse effects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, and attention are particularly affected in children with FASD. Eye movement tasks have proven to be a powerful tool for assessing deficits in executive function in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate aspects of executive function using a remote video-based eye tracking system in children with FASD. Children with FASD and ageand sex-matched control children performed a delayed memory-guided sequential task and a predictive task. In the delayed memory-guided sequential task, each trial began with the appearance of a central fixation point (FP) followed by the sequential appearance of two targets illuminated briefly in two of four quadrants of the screen. After a variable delay the central FP was extinguished, instructing the subject to generate two saccades to the remembered target locations in the same sequence in which they appeared. This task assessed the ability to suppress planned saccadic responses as well as working memory. In the predictive task, subjects were instructed to follow a target that alternated between two known locations in the right or left hemi-field at either specific inter-stimulus intervals of 750 ms and 1000 ms, or pseudo-randomly (interleaved trials). This task assesses the ability to adjust motor responses to a predictable sensory pattern. In the delayed memory-guided sequential task children with FASD had shorter latency SRT's, indicative of an increased frequency of timing errors. However, there were no differences between groups on the parameter of spatial working memory (correct sequence of saccades). In the predictive task, the FASD group differed from controls with respect to SRT, but not in amplitude or velocity of saccades. In contrast to the control group, SRT's within the FASD group did not differ between the fixed inter-stimulus intervals and the interleaved trials. These results suggest that subjects with FASD have difficulty using sensory information to modify the motor program. Together, these findings demonstrate that eye movement tasks can be used to assess deficits in response inhibition and sensory-motor integration in children with FASD.

N2  - Studies of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have consistently shown executive function deficits. In addition, one cross-sectional study has suggested that impairments in some aspects of executive function become more pronounced with age in this population. The goal of this project was to examine the development of executive abilities in a small longitudinal sample of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and typicallydeveloping controls. Fourteen children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) and nine non-exposed control children (CON), ages 7-14, were administered the Verbal Fluency (VF) and Trail Making (TM) tests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) twice, 1 to 5 years apart. Primary Measures included total correct responses for VF conditions (Letter Fluency, Category Fluency, Category Switching) and completion times for TM conditions (Visual Scanning, Number Sequencing, Letter Sequencing, Number-Letter Switching, Motor Speed). The difference between scaled scores was calculated to measure the rate of change relative to the norm on each of these eight Primary Measures. Scores were analyzed using analysis of variance techniques. The main effect of group was not significant, suggesting that change in performance over time on measures of VF and TM does not differ between groups. These data fail to replicate a previous cross-sectional study suggesting that children with FASD have difficulties with some executive function tasks which grow more pronounced with age. Based on this small longitudinal sample, it appears that performance on these executive function measures may develop at a rate similar in children with FASD and controls. Although children with FASD display impairments on measures of executive functioning, these impairments do not appear to worsen over time. Although our study was limited by a small sample size, it demonstrates the potential value of utilizing longitudinal techniques to address developmental changes in this population. Additional studies are needed to further examine the development of executive abilities in children with FASD.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with a continuum of neuropsychological and behavioral difficulties; the most severe outcome on this continuum is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The characteristic facial features of FAS allow identification of affected individuals. However, neuropsychological difficulties also occur in alcohol-exposed children who do not meet criteria for FAS. Because these children lack physical markers of maternal alcohol use, the link between prenatal alcohol exposure and neurobehavioral difficulties may be minimized. Clarification of a distinct neurobehavioral profile of prenatal alcohol exposure could aid in identification of alcohol-exposed children and lead to earlier interventions for affected individuals. In one previous investigation, latent profile analysis (LPA) was used successfully to distinguish alcohol-exposed children from controls using measures that focused primarily on executive function and spatial processing. The current study sought to extend this work by including a broader range of neuropsychological domains. A standardized neuropsychological test battery was administered individually to 174 children ages 6-16 with heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol but not FAS (n=63) and typically developing controls (n=111) and data were analyzed with LPA. To maximize power, 17 measures were selected based on their ability to distinguish between groups. Variables included measures of language, executive function, academic achievement, fine motor skills, visuomotor integration, learning, memory, and attention. Results indicated that a 2-class model best fit the data. Model fit was determined by testing multiple class solutions (e.g. 1 vs. 2-class models) and then evaluating two fit indices, the Akaike Information Critreria and Bayesian Information Criterion. In addition, the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test for the 1 vs. 2-class solution was evaluated. The resulting profile successfully distinguished subjects with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure from nonexposed controls with 79% overall accuracy; 81.0% of alcohol-exposed cases and 77.5% of controls were correctly classified. These data build on previous work and suggest that a wide range of neuropsychological measures can be used to distinguish nondysmorphic alcohol-exposed children from typically developing controls.

N2  - Volume of caudate nucleus but not hippocampus has been shown to be affected by fetal alcohol exposure (Archibald et al. 2001; Astley et al., 2009); both studies used manual tracing. Volumes of caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were measured using tracing by a senior neuroanatomist (CW) and FreeSurfer, an automated brain segmentation program. Structural MRI data were obtained from 32 Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) school-age children at 11.6 years (range=9.7-13.7) on a Siemens 3T Allegra scanner. 13 were heavily alcohol exposed, and 19 had mothers who abstained or drank at low levels during pregnancy. Five were diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and 8 were heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE). Inter-observer reliabilities for the manual tracing ranged from r=.94-.99, Median=.98. Manual tracing was highly correlated with FreeSurfer volumes, rs ranged from.74 for right hippocampus to.89 for total caudate, Median=.83. Frequency of alcohol use during pregnancy was related to smaller volumes based on both tracing (caudate, r=-.44, p =.01; corpus callosum, r=-.38, p <.05; hippocampus, r=-.32, p =.07) and automated segmentation (caudate, r=-.39, p >.05; corpus callosum, r=-.40, p <.025; hippocampus, r=-.36, p <.05) as well as smaller total intracranial volume (TIV; r=-.51, p<.01). There was a dose-dependent relation of diagnostic group to volumes of the three brain structures and TIV. Caudate, corpus callosum, and TIV were significantly smaller in the FAS group than HE and controls, and hippocampus was smaller in FAS than controls. Partial correlation was used to examine the degree to which the relation of fetal exposure with brain structure volume continued to be evident after adjustment for TIV. The relation of prenatal alcohol to caudate and corpus callosum volume was no longer significant but continued to be evident after control for TIV; by contrast, hippocampal volume was clearly no longer related to exposure. This study, which is the first to use FreeSurfer to examine brain structure in fetal alcohol exposed children, demonstrates the validity of this automated segmentation methodology, which is substantially more time-and cost-efficient than manual tracing. These data are also consistent with previous reports that caudate is disproportionately vulnerable to fetal alcohol exposure, whereas hippocampus is relatively spared.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol use in pregnancy is one of the few modifiable risk factors for poor pregnancy and child outcomes, including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Fetal alcohol exposure is one of the most common preventable causes of intellectual disability. Aims: To identify Australian women's preferred information sources, and their perceptions of health professionals' role regarding alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Methods: In 2006, via computer assisted telephone interview, we collected data from 1103 Australian women (69% participation) of childbearing age (18-45 years), including their preferred information sources, and the role of health professionals regarding alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Results: Half the participants had seen information about the effects of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. The most common sources were brochures (16%), media programmes or articles (13%), and television advertising (10%). Participants identified health professionals (52%) as the best source of information, followed by television advertisements (12%) and brochures (9%). The internet was a frequent second source of information (22%). Younger participants (18-29 years) were more likely to use the internet, family or friends, or school classes to find information; older participants (30-45 years) preferred media programmes or articles. Participants agreed that health professionals should ask pregnant women about alcohol (96.9%), should advise women how much alcohol is safe to drink in pregnancy (96.9%) and advise women who are thinking of becoming pregnant to give up drinking alcohol (91%). Conclusions: Australian women use a variety of information sources to learn about alcohol in pregnancy. However, in this survey they report a strong preference for health professionals to provide information to women including how much alcohol can be consumed safely in pregnancy. Strategies to reduce fetal alcohol exposure and prevent FASD should include clear guidelines for the community delivered via the preferred information sources women have identified in this survey.

N2  - Background: We have previously reported to this Society that fetal alcohol exposure during late gestation in sheep leads to endothelial dysfunction and increased stiffness in a wide range of vascular beds. Our present aim was to determine whether these effects persist into postnatal life. Method: Ethanol (0.75 g) was infused iv daily into 7 ewes, over 1 h, from 95 days to 135 days of gestation (term ~145 days). Control ewes (n = 7) received saline. The lambs were born normally and, at 8 weeks, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined in vivo. At 9 weeks the lambs were euthanised, and small (~250 lm diameter) coronary, renal, mesenteric, femoral and cerebral artery reactivity and wall stiffness were tested in vitro. Results: Endothelial relaxation was impaired in renal, femoral and mesenteric arteries from alcohol exposed lambs [P = 0.001]. Constriction was en- hanced in the femoral, and relaxation to nitroprusside impaired in renal and femoral vessels [P = 0.01]. Cerebral and coronary arteries were not affected. PWV was reduced in alcohol exposed lambs [P = 0.006], suggesting arteries were less stiff. Indeed, coronary and femoral vessels were more compliant when tested in vitro, but renal, mesenteric and cerebral arteries were stiffer following alcohol exposure. The reduction in PWV was greater in males. Conclusions: The vasodilator dysfunction identified in alcohol exposed fetuses persists postnatally in some vascular beds. In contrast, the arterial stiffness observed in alcohol-exposed fetuses is reversed, giving way to increased compliance associated with lower PWV in lambs. These permanent vascular changes in early postnatal life may lead to life long risk for vascular disease.

N2  - Background: Few studies have investigated the effects of fetal alcohol exposure on the developing lung. We recently showed that alcohol exposure during the third trimester impairs the maturation and immune status of the fetal ovine lung. Our present aim was to investigate whether these alterations persist into postnatal life. Methods: Pregnant ewes were catheterized at gestational day (GD) 90 and infused daily with ethanol (0.75 g/kg i.v., n = 9) or saline (n = 7) over 1 h from GD95-135. Ewes gave birth naturally at term (~GD147). At two months after birth, lung tissue was collected and the lung parenchyma was morphometrically analyzed. Surfactant protein (SP)-A, -B, -C and -D and interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Surfactant phospholipid composition in lung lavage fluid was analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: There were no significant differences in lung tissue weight, volume and morphometry, collagen content, pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and surfactant phospholipid composition between the control and ethanol-exposed groups. SP-D mRNA levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the ethanol-exposed lambs compared to controls. Conclusions: Daily prenatal ethanol exposure during the third trimester does not significantly alter lung growth and structure at two months after birth. Although SP-D expression was not altered in the fetus, it was increased in ethanol-exposed lambs; as SP-D has immunomodulatory roles, innate immunity may be altered. As the alterations observed in the fetal lung immediately following ethanol exposure do not persist, this suggests the lung is able to repair.

N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which is linked to early pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction, and impaired placentation. Alcohol impairs the immune response, but its effects on the complex interactions between the feto-placental unit and the maternal immune system, which arc necessary for placentation, are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of chronic gestational exposure to alcohol on cytokine expression profiles in placenta, mesometrial triangle (MT-implantation site), amniotic fluid, and maternal serum. Design: Pregnant Long-Evans rats were fed with isocaloric liquid diets in which alcohol comprised 0% (N= 4) or 24% (N= 8) of the caloric content, starting on gestational day (GD) 6. Blood, amniotic fluid, placentae, and MT were harvested on GD 18. The samples were subjected to a bead-based multiplex ELISA, which included measurement of 11 pro-inflammatory cytokines, 5 anti-inflammatory cytokines, 5 anti-inflammatory chemokines, 1 pro-inflammatory chemokine, and 2 growth factors. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. Results: 24-plex analysis revealed that, in controls, the levels of nearly all analytes measured, except GCSF, IL-1beta, and TNF-alphafz were in higher in placenta as compared to the MT. Gestational alcohol exposure significantly reduced expression of 9 cytokines in the MT, 7 of which were pro-inflammatory in nature (IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, IP-10, and MCP-1). The 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines reduced by ethanol exposure were IL-5 and eotaxin. In contrast, VEGF was significantly elevated in the MT of alcohol-exposed dams. Alcohol exposure had no significant effect on cytokine expression profiles in placental tissue, amniotic fluid, or maternal serum. Conclusion: Chronic gestational exposure to alcohol alters cytokine expression profiles at the site of implantation. Alcohol-mediated reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are needed to promote trophoblast implantation, could represent a critical factor in the pathogenesis of impaired placentation in FASD. Moreover, increased VEGF expression could reflect persistence of non-converted maternal vessels associated with ethanol exposure.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is characterized by growth deficiency and all models of intrauterine growth restriction demonstrate reductions in uterine blood flow (UBF). Pregnancy-induced increases in UBF (30 fold) are associated with elevation in eNOS expression, phosphorylation, and NO production at the level of UAECs. We hypothesized that alcohol will reduce eNOS expression and its activity by reducing eNOS phosphorylation via alterations in the signaling pathways that control eNOS activity in UAECs. UAECs from pregnant ewes (gestational day 120-130) were validated using FACS. Maternal binge drinking patterns were mimicked; UAECs (passage 4, n = 5 replicates) were treated with 0 (control), 60, 90, 120, or 150 mg/ dl of alcohol in a compensating system for 3 h on 3 consecutive days. Cell viability was validated by trypan blue microscopy, Calcein AM imaging, and caspase 3 immunoblotting. The number of viable cells between groups was not different (control, 891,250 + 11,433; alcohol, 834,000 + 49,784; P=0.73). Uncleaved caspase 3 was unaltered and cleaved caspase 3 was undetectable. Compared to control, at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl alcohol, total eNOS level was significantly reduced to 70%, 70%, 63%, and 43% respectively. p635eNOS also decreased substantially to 29%, 21%, 18%, and 15% with increasing alcohol doses. Caveolin-1, a protein associated with eNOS was significantly decreased only at the highest dose. Investigation of the ERK1/2 pathway, the major signaling cascade coupled to eNOS activation in UAECs revealed that total ERK1 was reduced to 87%, 75%, 55%, and 16% and total ERK2 was reduced to 66%, 55%, 35%, and 21%, respectively at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl alcohol. Further, pERK1 level was reduced to 57%, 32%, 29%, and 24% with increasing alcohol doses. These alterations were specific to ERK1/2 signaling in that pAKT or total AKT were not altered among groups. These data were consistent with and validated by both confocal imaging as well as high throughput proteomics. These data delineate the effects of binge alcohol on the abundance and post-translational modification via phosphorylation of eNOS and ERK1/2 enzymes in UAECs. Further, stoichiometrically disproportional levels of eNOS and caveolin-1 may influence eNOS activation. These results strongly suggest that intrauterine environment plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of FASD.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Youth living with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) face particular challenges in achieving success in school, the workplace, and the wider community. Risk and protective factors each affect the youths' ability to maximize their potential, greatly influencing outcomes. There is an urgent need for an assessment tool that reflects these risk and protective factors experienced throughout their life, as well as the youths' lived experiences. The present study attempts to create an interview tool that will better assess resilience levels among young males. Methods: Focus groups comprised of the researcher, a young male living with FASD, and adults close to the young male, constructed interview questions to match the cognitive ability of the young male; questions examine early life stability, risk factors, resilience levels, world view, and temperament. Using an iterative research design, this tool will identify the effect of these and other criminogenic factors on life outcomes for predominantly urban males, 16 to 20 years of age, who are or have been involved with the justice system. Results: It is expected that this tool will greatly assist in accurately predicting the negative relationship between instability in daily living and positive life outcomes for youth living with FASD. Conclusions/Discussion: Through the use of this tool, risk factors will be better identified and processes can be implemented for early interventions with families unable to provide a stable and supportive environment for their children, particularly if their children are living with the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) in meconium are validated biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure. In clinical practice, meconium analysis can potentially be used to identify newborns at risk for alcohol-related disabilities, who can then be followed up and assisted if any disabilities emerge. This study aims to determine whether women are willing to partake in such screening by assessingmaternal participation in a pilot neonatal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: All Grey-Bruce women delivering at St. Joseph's Hospital were offered a screening program involving meconium analysis and long-term follow-up of positive cases. With consent, meconium was collected and tested for FAEE using validated methods. Positive cases were followed-up by a public health nurse who conducted timely developmental assessments and made referrals to appropriate intervention programs if delays emerged. The rates of voluntary participation and positivity for fetal exposure in this open screening program were then compared to the rates previously observed in this population when testing was offered anonymously. Results: Of the 55 women who were offered screening, 43 consented. Among these, one positive case was identified and is currently being followed-up by the Public Health Department. The consent rate in this open screening program is significantly lower (p<0.05) than in the previous study where testing was anonymous (78% vs. 94%, respectively), and the positivity rate is only 3%in contrast to 30% positivity rate observed with anonymous testing (p<0.01). Conclusions: Findings suggest that open screening results in lower participation and low positivity for fetal exposure. This implies that despite the potential benefits of such screening programs, maternal unwillingness to consent may severely limit the usefulness of meconium testing for large population-based open screening.

N2  - Case report:: A 16-year old girl presented after two generalized seizures for neurological assessment. At the age of 9 years fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was diagnosed based on microcephaly, characteristic facial anomalies including short palpebral fissures, thin vermilion border of the upper lip and smooth philtrum as well as postnatal growth retardation and global cognitive deficits. Neurological examination was otherwise normal. A waking state EEG showed focal slowing and focal sharp waves in the right temporal region, an EEG during sleep was normal. MRI of the brain revealed an abnormally thick cortex with bilateral polymicrogyria (PMG) in the superior frontal gyrus with asymmetric distribution. Discussion: A wide range of cerebral malformations is associated with FAS as demonstrated in both histological and neuroradiological studies. There is experimental evidence that alcohol interferes with many molecular, neurochemical and cellular events occurring during normal development of the brain. In the first month of human gestation maternal ethanol drinking is associated with a great incidence of craniofacial and neuronal tube anomalies. In the second trimester alcohol exposure reduces the number of neurons and glia cells in the neocortex and induces changes in radial glia as well as neuronal proliferation, generation, and migration. During the third trimester of gestation alcohol interferes with synaptogenesis as well as glial development, increases natural cell death and cell necrosis, and involves the impairment of neuronal cell migration. PMG in FAS has been described only in a single patient who was included in a neuropathology study in 1979. The autopsy of this patient revealed PMG in the orbital, temporal, and parieto-occipital surfaces. In our patient history, clinical features, and genetic investigations provided no evidence for any of the known genetic or acquired causes of PMG. Therefore, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of PMG in our patient rather than a mere coincidence. Conclusion: We present the 2nd patient of PMG in FAS and confirm the phenotypic variability of cerebral malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In patients with severe neurological impairment or seizures neuroimaging is recommended. Furthermore, FAS should be considered as a differenzial diagnosis for PMG.

N2  - Background: A cardinal feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), and models of IUGR demonstrate dysfunctional maternal uterine vascular adaptations including lower uterine blood flow and decreased angiogenesis. This altered remodeling is mediated in part by estrogen, which is significantly elevated during gestation. Further, estrogen specifically induces ovine pregnant uterine artery endothelial cell (P-UAEC) proliferation. Hypothesis: In this study, we hypothesized that there exists an interaction between estrogen and alcohol on ovine P-UAEC proliferation. Methods: P-UAECs were isolated from pregnant ewes(gestationalday120-130; term= 147), FACS sorted, validated, and maintained in culture to passage 4. To mimic maternal binge drinking patterns, P-UAECs were cultured in the absence or presence of alcohol (150 mg/dl) in a compensating system for 3 h on 3 consecutive days. Cell viability was validated by trypan blue exclusion microscopy, Calcein AM imaging, and immunoblotting. Following this treatment paradigm, control and binge alcohol treated P-UAECs were abstained from alcohol for two days and then treated with increasing concentrations of estrogen (0.1, 1, 10 nM) in the presence or absence of alcohol. Angiogenesis index was evaluated using BrdU Proliferation Assay. Results: Trypan blue stained cell count demonstrated that the number of viable cells in the control and binge alcohol groups were not different (control, 891,250 +/- 11,433; alcohol, 834,000 +/- 49,784; P = 0.73). We also observed that uncleaved caspase 3 was unaltered by binge alcohol and cleaved caspase 3 was not detectable demonstrating cell viability. A significant main effect of the alcohol treatment paradigm was noted (two way ANOVA, P = 0.003). Irrespective of the dose, estrogen-induced P-UAEC proliferation was significantly decreased in response to chronicbingealcohol(P = 0.025). Incontrast, estrogen-induced proliferation trended higher in response to acute alcohol treatment (P = 0.057). Further, estrogen-induced proliferation in chronic binge treated P-UAECs was significantly lower compared to acute alcohol treatment (P <0.001). Interestingly, these findings were closely associated with the effects of binge alcohol on the activity state and expression of the angiogenesis-associated enzyme eNOS and its related signaling cascades. Alcohol decreased P635eNOS, total eNOS, PERK1, total ERK1, and total ERK2 to 15%, 43%, 24%, 16%, and 21%, respectively whereas no alterations were observed with the AKT pathway. Conclusions: Thus: 1) proliferative effects of alcohol depend on the alcohol treatment paradigm; 2) chronic binge alcohol impairs estrogen-induced proliferation; 3) binge alcohol decreases the expression and activity of eNOS, a protein associated with P-UAEC proliferation; 3) effects of chronic binge alcohol on P-UAECs are specifically associated with ERK cascade not AKT pathway; and 5) these findings support the idea that the uterine compartment may play a key role in the pathogenesis of FASD.

N2  - The number of multiple congenital anomaly syndromes is increasing. Dysmorphology is important in the recognition and description of syndromes. Information obtained from studies of developmental and cellular processes in lower organisms has offered significant contributions to the understanding of the pathogenesis of syndromes. Most of the syndromes have genetic defects including chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations. Mutations in genes for transcription factors, growth factors, receptors, cell adhesion molecules, signal transduction, structural proteins, and transporters have been identified in genetic syndromes. In addition, alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which includes a range of developmental deficits. Fetal anticonvulsant syndromes are another example of environmental factors. Clinical use of genetic diagnosis is rapidly developing. Molecular diagnosis is available in many of the well known syndromes. Genome-wide screening of patients with multiple congenital anomaly and/or mental retardation using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization has recently led to the identification of new microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Proper diagnosis of syndromes makes it possible to provide genetic counseling for the parents, medical care and an accurate prediction relative to such a child's future development. Longitudinal observation of patients is necessary for better clinical management. Clinical investigations can also help to identify the genes involved in normal and abnormal morphogenesis, which often act as patterning genes and transcription factors that regulate other genes during embryonic development. Cooperation between basic studies and clinical genetics will produce promising results.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal stress was shown to induce a chronic anxiety state in adult humans. In addition to stress, fetus can be affected by alcohol. In USA 12.2% pregnant women are reported to use alcohol [1]. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by physical, psychical, and behavioral disturbances and learning deficit. The aim of the work was to study the influence of prenatal stress in combination with alcohol on locomotor activity, anxiety, and social behavior (sniffing and licking) of mice. Methods: Pregnant CBA/LacJ mice were given 11% ethanol solution ad libitum throughout gestation (without access to water) and stressed (restriction two hours daily in an unpredictable manner) during the last week of pregnancy. Three-month-old male offspring (A+S) were tested in the open field, dark-light box, elevated plus maze, marble burying, and social interaction tests. The control group consisted of the male mice of the same age from non-stressed dams, which had drunk the water during gestation. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA Results: In the marble burying test, A+S animals buried significantly more marbles (7.7+/-1.1) than intact ones (4.1+/-0.5) [F(1,27) = 8.77, P<0.01]. In the social interaction test, A+S animals spent more time (300.8+/-20.7 s) sniffing and licking three-week-old male mouse than intact ones (190.5+/-11.4 s) [F(1,28) = 21.75, P<0.001]. The total path length in the open field, test and the time spent in the center of the open field, for A+S mice did not differ from that of intact ones [F(1,17) = 0.001, P>0.05] and [F(1,17) = 0.32, P>0.05]. In the dark-light box test, no significant differences between A+S and intact animals in the time spent in the light compartment were found [F(1,16) = 0.94, P>0.05]. In the elevated plus maze test, there were also no differences in the time spent in open arms between A+S and control mice [F(1,16) = 0.06, P>0.05]. Therefore, in three tests for anxiety (dark-light box, elevated plus maze, time in the center of the open field) no significant effect of prenatal stress and alcohol exposure was found. The marble burying test is considered as an experimental model of obsessivecompulsive disorder [2,3]. An increased number of buried marbles and the enhanced social activity time in A+S mice were shown. Significantly increased sniffing and licking in A+S animals represent the manifestation of obsessions and compulsions rather than social interaction. The lack of any differences between A+S and control animals in the path length in the open field test showed that an increased marble burying and social activity was not associated with locomotor activity deviation. Conclusions: Stress and alcohol during prenatal development do not influence on anxiety state and locomotor activity in mice. Prenatal exposure to stress and alcohol can produce obsessivecompulsive- like behavior.

N2  - Objective: The fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the leading non genetic cause of mental disability and social and emotional problems in affected children, adolescents and young adults. However, efforts on research and prevention up to date have been poor. Materials and methods: In the Muenster University FAS clinic 135 young FAS patients were assessed for IQ, sustained attention, memory, information processing and psychosocial development. Additionally, social and emotional outcome was studied in 60 adult patients with FAS. Results: Children and adolescents with FAS show severe deficits in cognitive functioning. They suffer from a burdensome social and emotional maladaptation. Most adult FAS patients live in dependent circumstances. The occupational development is characterized by disruption and failure, and severe social problems are common in patients. Three in four adult patients are victims of (sexual) abuse. Conclusions: Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy causes severe cognitive, emotional and behavioural impairments in the child. Deficits are irreversible and persisting. Prevention of FAS, thus, is essential in gynecological counseling. Due of the variety of impairments caused by prenatal alcohol exposition and the persisting inability of independent living, patients with FAS need intense care, support and assistance throughout life.

N2  - Cerebral angiogenesis during brain development is under control of growth factors from the vascular endothelial growth factor family (VEGF). The fact that alcohol affects VEGF expression and angio-genesis in adults prompted us to investigate whether prenatal alcohol exposure may alter brain vascularization in both rodent and human foetuses. Mouse foetuses and pups were exposed to different concentrations of alcohol (0.5-3 g/kg) from embryonic day 13 to the first day of life (P1). Twelve foetuses with foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and age matched controls (22-36 WG) were also selected. Morphometric analyses on Glut1 immunostained brain slices were carried out. Protein and mRNA levels of the endothelium marker PECAM and VEGF receptors were quantified by q-RT-PCR and Western blot in mice. Calcimetry and videomicroscopy studies were performed on mouse cultured endothelial cells. In mice, perinatal alcohol exposure induced a dose-dependent reduction of the vascular network with a disorganization of microvessels which were randomly distributed. Protein and mRNA levels of PE-CAM and VEGF receptors were significantly reduced. Alcohol inhibited glutamate-induced calcium mobilization in endothelial cells and affected microvessel growth and survival. Though microvessel density was not significantly modified in human brains, cortical micro-vessel architecture was disorganized, 30-50% of vessels being non radially oriented 30 WG onwards. These results suggest that alcohol-induced developmental brain abnormalities could be partly due to vascular defects, and that members of the VEGF family would have an interest as FAS biomarkers.

N2  - Introduction: Alcohol use in pregnancy has been associated with numerous adverse effects including miscarriage, stillbirth, malformations, low birthweight and infant mortality. Developmental problems and fetal alcohol syndrome may occur. Despite national recommendations to abstain from alcohol use during pregnancy, rates remain high in Australia. Co-morbid psychiatric and alcohol use disorders are common and have been shown to have detrimental effects on treatment outcomes, with increased medical comorbidity, suicide, violence, child abuse. Aims: To determine the use of alcohol during pregnancy in women referred to a perinatal mental health team. Methods: A retrospective study of pregnant women referred to a perinatal mental health team was undertaken. A review of medical records identified the reported use of alcohol during pregnancy, demographic details including age, employment status, marital status, parity and psychiatric diagnosis. Outcomes of pregnancy recorded include gestational age at birth of baby, birth weight and malformations. Results: Of the 27 cases referred to the perinatal mental health clinic, 2 reported alcohol use during pregnancy. The average age was 28.96 years. 85.2% (23/27) were married or in a relationship; 14.8% (4/7) were single. 44.4% (12/27) were employed, 40.7% (11/27) were unemployed and there was a lack of data recorded on the employment status of 14.8% (4/27) cases. The mean number of previous pregnancies was 2.19. Psychiatric diagnoses were depression in 37% (10/27), anxiety in 22.2% (6/27), anorexia nervosa in 3.7% (1/27) case. 37% (10/27) recorded no psychiatric disorder. The average gestational age was 38 weeks. Mean weight of newborn babies was 3.41 kg. There were no major malformations identified in these cases; one newborn had an abnormal toe position. Discussion: Co-morbid alcohol use and psychiatric disorders can result in significant negative outcomes for the mother and offspring. The findings of this study indicate that alcohol use during pregnancy is low. These findings may be due to limitations of the study. Data is self-reported and may be underreported due to social desirability. In addition, the small numbers used in this study is a limitation. Alcohol use during pregnancy continues to be highly prevalent in Australia and a public health concern. It is important to identify these women early and implement appropriate management to minimize the harm of both alcohol and psychiatric illness to the mother and offspring.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure is known to induce deficiencies in fetal brain development. We found that ADNF-9, a peptide derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor and composed of nine amino acids (SALLRSIPA) is neuroprotective. We used a mouse model of fetal alcohol exposure to identify the intracellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ADNF-9. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned to the following groups: (1) ethanol liquid diet (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v) ethanol derived calories; (2) pair-fed control; (3) ALC combined with administration (i.p.) of ADNF-9 (20 and 30 mug/20 g body weight); and (4) pair-fed combined with administration (i.p.) of ADNF-9 (20 and 30 mug/20 g body weight). On E13 fetal brains were collected, weighed, and assayed for Bcl2 protein levels using Western blot. Our results show that ADNF-9 significantly prevents alcohol-induced reductions in fetal brain weight at both doses. Western blot analysis of mitochondrial protein fractions revealed that prenatal alcohol exposure causes a significant down-regulation in Bcl2 protein levels. Importantly, ADNF-9 administration reduced this alcohol-induced decrease in Bcl2 at only the highest dose (30 mug/20 g i.p.). These data indicate that the Bcl2 pathway is an intracellular target of ADNF-9 and this neuroprotective mechanism of action provides a direction for potential therapeutics against alcohol-induced neural damage during prenatal development.

N2  - The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) describes the continuum of adverse effects that result from prenatal alcohol exposure. Most frequently, prenatal alcohol exposure induces subtle neurochemical and structural changes throughout the brain rather than gross malformations. The consequences of alcohol exposure then manifest in a wide variety of mild to moderate brain dysfunctions in processes such as memory, executive function, attention, and sensory-motor skills. In these studies, children with FASD (male and female, 5-17 years of age) and age- and sex-matched controls performed a series of structured eye movement tasks and/or a visually-guided reaching task in a robotic virtual reality system. The measurement of eye movement control is a powerful tool for assessing sensory, motor and cognitive function, whereas reaching tasks can be used to examine both feedforward and feedback sensory-motor integration. In structured eye movement tasks, children with FASD made many more errors in tasks requiring cognitive flexibility, and these increased error rates correlate strongly to deficits in spatial working memory. In a delayed, memory-guided saccade task, children with FASD completed fewer correct trials. Incorrect trials included: sequence errors where the saccades were directed to target locations in the incorrect order; timing errors where the subject initiated a saccadic response before the go signal; and false starts where the subject broke fixation but returned to the central fixation point to restart the task at the go signal. In the visually-guided reaching task, children with FASD differed from controls in many task outcome measures, specifically those measures related to the initial motor response and corrective responses. In particular, large effect sizes were observed for outcome measures related to the first (initial) movement (e.g., distance and direction error), the total movement path length relative to the optimal path length, and the ratio of the first sub-movement distance to total movement distance. These data suggest that children with FASD have difficulty integrating sensory information into planned motor movements. In summary, eye movement and bilateral reaching tasks can be coupled with novel technologies to create an integrated platform of non-invasive, neurobehavioural tasks that can be used to identify and objectively quantify functional deficits in children with FASD.

N2  - Preface: Alcohol drinking during pregnancy is dangerous for health of both the mother and the baby. In Russia drinking during pregnancy is not strictly prohibited, and even it is often considered quite harmless by close environment of the woman and by herself. The goal of our research is the consideration of the drinking by pregnant women learning the example of situation in Nizhny Novgorod region, Russia. Methods: The grant questionnaire 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention in Russia' developed by research FAS group [1] was used as a basic method. The self-reports of women were analyzed. We have questioned 150 pregnant women of 18-44 years old and analyzed the frequency of alcohol drinking of different types during pregnancy and 3 mouths before it. Results: In the issue the following data was obtained: the most of the woman reduce drinking during pregnancy, but a lot of pregnant woman are at risk zone. Conclusion: Drinking in any rate is a problem for public health in Russia. There is no "safe rate drinking" and the period for drinking during pregnancy. All drinks containing alcohol can harm the baby. Total abstinence of pregnant women is the objective of Russian public health development.

N2  - Introduction: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is dangerous for any woman and her unborn child. In Russia, alcohol consumption during pregnancy is not strictly prohibited, and it is often considered to be harmless by pregnant women and by the general public. A study in the Nizhny Novgorod region of Russia in 2004/2005 measured alcoholic drinking rates for women during pregnancy and during the three months prior to pregnancy. Method: The questionnaire used in the grant, 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention in Russia', developed by the research FAS group [1] was used as a basic method. In the FAS group's study, 648 women were included. Of these women, 155 pregnant women (ages of 18 to 44) were interviewed. Drinking habits were self-reported by involved participants. Frequency analysis was used as the method of analysis. Significance of differences was measured by Student T-test. Results: During the three months before pregnancy, drinking of 7 or more alcohol doses per week and 4 or more doses at a time was found to be common for 50% of women. Of these women, 34% of women consumed these levels of alcohol less often than once per month, 10% of women consumed once per month, 3% consumed two-three times monthly, and 4% consumed once per week. Women drinking 7 or more alcoholic doses per week and binge drinking were found to believe that lower quantities of spirits were harmful during pregnancy and that fewer amounts of alcoholic doses could be considered hard drinking during this time than drinking women in the not-at-risk group (differences are reliable at a rate of 0.01). During pregnancy, drinking rates were found to be lower-no women drinking 7 or more alcoholic doses per week or binge drinking; however, 1 to 3 doses weekly were still imbibed by 23.5 % of pregnant women. Conclusion: Drinking in any rate is a problem for public health in Russia. It is known that there are no safe drinking rates during pregnancy and it doesn't depend on spirit type or frequency of consumption-which is the foundation for why women are at risk of damaging their own health and health of the unborn child. All alcoholic drinks can harm the baby, yet there is still a prevalence of drinking, including drinking in high quantities, among pregnant women in Russia.

N2  - Objectives: Folic acid (FOL) is concentrated in the fetal circulation by the placenta so that cord levels are higher than maternal levels. FOL is also required for detoxification of formic acid(FA), the toxic metabolite of methanol that has recently been observed in cord blood of infants born to alcohol-using mothers (Kapur BM et al. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 2009;33:134A). The objectives of this study was to determine if FOL transport to the fetus is decreased after heavy alcohol exposure and therefore the ability to detoxify FA is compromised. This may contribute to deficits observed in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Folate was measured in maternal and cord blood from alcohol-abusing mothers and controls. Results: The fetal:maternal serum folate ratio was = 1.0 in half of the alcohol-exposed pairs (n = 12), whereas all of the controls were > 1.0 (n = 8). Mean folate in cord samples was lower in alcohol-exposed than in the controls (25.83 +/- 13.58 vs 44.04 +/- 10.86, p < 0.01). There was a significant correlation between the control maternal and cord folate levels (p < 0.05) whereas the alcohol group correlation was not significant. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that FOL transport to the fetus is compromised in pregnancies affected by alcohol-abuse. This supports our hypothesis that FA may indeed be a significant contributor in the etiology of FASD, and, that FOL as part of treatment to mitigate its effects need to be investigated.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure causes a collection of permanent physiological, and neurobehavioral deficits termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The timing and amount of exposure cannot fully explain the substantial variability among affected individuals, pointing to unelucidated genetic influences on individual vulnerability to alcohol effects. We investigated the role of genetic influences by administering ethanol (E), pair-fed (PF), or control (C) diets to pregnant dams of the outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) and inbred Brown Norway (BN) rat strains after they were mated with their own or with the other strain. The dams' plasma levels of free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), free T3 (fT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured to elucidate potential differences in their maternal thyroid hormonal environment, which is known to affect the neurobehavioral outcome of FASD. SD and BN dams exhibited different baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) function and SD dams were more severely affected by alcohol consumption. We then compared the bodyweight and placental weight of E, PF, and C offspring of each fetal strain on gestational day 21 (G21). The degree of fetal bodyweight decrease after alcohol exposure was modulated by the genetic contribution of both parents, while alcohol increased placental weight in all of the strains. Additional C, PF, and E offspring of reciprocal SD/BN crosses were allowed to develop into adulthood. E-exposed offspring exhibited two types of behavioral effects: dependent and independent of the parental strains. The two reciprocal crosses were differentially susceptible to an E-induced deficit in social behavior just as the E-consuming SD mother was more susceptible to thyroid hormone alterations. In contrast, E-induced memory deficits were consistent across the reciprocal crosses, suggesting a possible mechanistic link to strain-independent effects of alcohol such as placental enlargement. These findings show the utility of a rat model to dissect the neurobehavioral deficits of FASD into those that are strongly influenced by genetic susceptibility/resiliency, and others that probably arise from robust effects of the environmental insult itself.

N2  - Background: Recent surveys of physicians in Russia demonstrated limited knowledge about Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and lack of experience related to FASD prevention and interventions. Information on FAS, risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies, and brief interventions (BI) was not included in the medical school curriculum or in required Continuing Medical Education (CME) courses. The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate an FASD training curriculum for medical professionals in Russia. Methods: FASD Competency-Based Curriculum Development Guide and Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis (CDC, 2004) were adapted and implemented for training of Russian physicians. A pre-post test design in a randomized educational trial was used to determine the effectiveness of training in changing physicians' knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward drinking during pregnancy. OBGs (N = 65) and pediatricians (N = 73) from different regions of Russia were recruited to participate in the study through the CME program at St. Petersburg Pediatric Academy. The physicians were trained in groups by specialty and were randomly assigned to either experimental (a 3-hour FASD module as a part of regular CME program) or control condition (regular CME program without FASD module). A total of 14 groups of physicians were included in the study. Participants' pre-post changes in FASD knowledge, attitudes, and skills were assessed using questionnaires. In addition, OBGs' BI skills were assessed using coded videotapes of role plays with a simulated patient. Results: Pediatricians and OBGs who received FASD training demonstrated significantly improved knowledge about the effects of alcohol on fetal development and less acceptance of alcohol use during pregnancy than physicians who did not receive training. Pediatricians who received training had higher levels of competency in FASD diagnosis. Compared to OBGs assigned to regular CME, OBGs who received training had significantly improved BI skills and higher levels of competency in conducting screening and BI. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a three-hour FASD education module included in CME for pediatricians and OBGs leads to significant changes in physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and skills. Implications for public health and barriers for implementation of screening and BI for FASD prevention in Russia are discussed.

N2  - Many children affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy can not be identified using current diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We are investigating whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene and protein expression may provide reliable diagnostic indicators of maternal drinking during pregnancy as well as prognostic indicators of brain damage predictive of adverse behavioral outcomes in offspring. Pregnant Long-Evans rats consumed either saccharin water or 5% ethanol in saccharin water four hours per day throughout gestation, producing a mean maternal peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. At term, placentas were processed for gene and protein expression. Microarray analysis of > 28,000 genes revealed that the expression of 304 known genes was altered two-fold or greater in placenta from ethanol-consuming dams compared to controls. The genes altered encode proteins associated with CNS development, organ morphogenesis, immunologic responses, endocrine function, ion homeostasis and skeletal, cardiovascular and cartilage development. 2D-PAGE analyses and mass spectroscopy were used to separate and identify placental proteins affected by moderate drinking during pregnancy. To date, at least twenty of 1,181 protein spots are altered in placentas from ethanol-consuming dams. Fourteen of the twenty protein spots have been identified. Some of the identified proteins play critical roles in placental and neural development, toxicity or apoptosis. For example, the PDPC10 protein is involved in vascular morphogenesis and remodeling, an effect that may contribute to ethanol-induced changes in vascular remodeling during neurodevelopment. These results suggest that the expression of a sufficiently large number of placental mRNAs and proteins are altered after moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD. Further, these results provide insights on novel mechanisms of how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function and brain development.

N2  - Background: Russia has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the world and increasingly hazardous drinking in young women. Fetal alcohol exposure, including early in pregnancy when a woman may not know she is pregnant, has adverse outcomes. Data on women's alcohol consumption, contraception use, and risk for alcohol exposed pregnancies (AEP) in Russia are limited. This study was designed to collect data for developing prevention of AEP in Russia. Method: Women were recruited at public women's clinics in St. Petersburg (SPB) and the Nizhniy Novgorod Region (NNR). Six hundred forty-eight childbearing age women completed a face-to-face structured interview that assessed alcohol consumption and contraception use. Results: Among nonpregnant women (N = 347), 89% reported consuming alcohol and 65% reported binge drinking in the last three months, including 47% in NNR and 28% in SPB having binges at least once a month; 70% in NNR and 44% in SPB were at-risk for pregnancy1, including 12% in NNR and 9% in SPB who were trying to conceive. These women consumed alcohol at similar rates and amounts as women who were not at-risk for pregnancy; among trying to conceive women, 61% in SPB and 72% in NNR reported binge drinking. There was a significant decline in drinking after pregnancy identification: among pregnant women (N = 301), 20% reported drinking, including 6% in SBP (none in NNR) who reported current binge drinking. Differences in drinking and risk for AEP were identified between women in SPB and NNR. Conclusions: Although Russian women decrease alcohol consumption after pregnancy identification, high levels of consumption were reported in the preconception period. The high proportion of Russian women at risk for AEP constitutes a substantial risk for fetal alcohol exposure early in pregnancy and indicates the importance of primary prevention of AEP. A preconceptional, dual-focused (alcohol use/pregnancy planning/ contraception) intervention targeting women at risk for AEP has significant potential for preventing FASD in Russia.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Alcohol (ethanol) consumption during pregnancy is linked to congenital heart defects associated with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Because reports have linked ethanol (EtOH) exposure with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, we defined whether a similar relationship exists between ethanol and modulation of cardiac cell fate determination by Wnt-beta-catenin signaling. Exposure of pregnant mice during gastrulation on ED 6.75 to a binge-drinking dose of EtOH induced atrioventricular and semi-lunar valve defects, as determined noninvasively on ED15.5 by echocardiography. EtOH exposure of avian embryos suppressed Wnt/beta-catenin modulated Hex (a marker of the primary heart field) and Islet-1 (a marker for the second heart field) gene expression within the cardiogenic crescent. Folic acid supplementation was tested for prevention of EtOH induced birth defects. Upon 30% EtOH exposure in the avian model, culture medium supplementation with FA, with and without myoinositol, resulted in normal expression of the cardiac markers. In the mouse after EtOH exposure, Folate supplementation or FA in combination with myo-Inositol resulted in normal valve development (100%) on ED 15.5 as assessed by echocardiography. In conclusion, Folate supplementation at a high dose of 10.5 mg/kg in diet, or in combination with myoinositol, prevented alcohol potentiation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling allowing normal cardiac gene activation and cardio-genesis.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is reported to be associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in some offspring. One of the concerns of pregnancy in diabetic women is a several-fold increase in birth defects in the offspring. Thus both maternal alcohol consumption and pregnancy in diabetes mellitus (DM) constitute independent risk factors for offspring maldevelopment. DM women are reported to not differ from non DM women in the drinking and smoking behavior. We aimed to determine the effects of potential interaction between acute doses of alcohol and maternal DM during gestation on fetal skeletal development. Mice were made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ) on gestation day (GD) 2. Single doses of 25% v/v of absolute alcohol in saline (0.03 ml/g body weight) was administered (IP) to groups of DM and non-DM animals on GD 7 or 8. One group of DM animals was treated with insulin (SC). Skeletons of GD 18 fetuses were stained with Alizarin redS and Alcian blue. Fetuses of both ethanol and DM group of mice were observed to have a low incidence of skull bones hypoplasia and vertebral defects. Ethanol injection of DM mice on GD 7 resulted in accentuation of DM-related skeletal defects. Treatment on GD 8 resulted in defects of axial and appendicular skeletons differentially. Combination treatment induced markedly poor ossification in about 60% of animals. Alcohol also was found to augment the frequency of supernumerary ribs and sternal anomalies and poor ossification of bones of paws. These data suggest that alcohol affects the developmental processes of mesoderm of embryos of diabetic mouse resulting in augmentation of skeletal malformations.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) account for a high frequency of growth deficiency, birth defects, and neurobehavioral impairment in infants. An ongoing study in Ukraine seeks to determine whether maternal nutrient status interacts with alcohol exposure to influence the risk for FASD. 3,736 pregnant women (mean gestational age 20.4 +/- 7.0 wks) were screened between April 2008 and December 2009 in two regions of Ukraine. 46.4% of the women were taking prenatal vitamins and/or folic acid at the time of screening. 10.9% were taking supplemental iodine. 94.8% of the women reported some alcohol consumption, a proportion that exceeds the U.S. 44.7%) reported consuming alcohol in the month around conception, and 33.3%) reported consuming alcohol in the most recent month of pregnancy. 9.0% reported at least one binge episode of 4 or more drinks in the month around conception, and 7.5% reported at least one binge episode of 4 or more drinks in the most recent month of pregnancy. A sample of screened women who reported frequent or binge drinking and low/unexposed comparison women were recruited into a prospective cohort study of maternal risk factors for alcohol-related pregnancy outcomes. Analysis to date of maternal baseline plasma samples shows that alcohol-exposed women (N=63) had lower Zn and Cu concentrations vs. controls (N=53). Ferritin, Fe, Mg, Ca, ceruloplasmin activity, methyl-donor nutrients (choline, betaine, DMG, folate, Vit B12, and homocysteine), Vit A, E, and indices of oxidative stress and inflammation (TBARS, protein carbonyls, hsCRP) were similar between groups. Regression analyses showed that the absolute oz. of alcohol/drinking day (AADD) in the month around conception was associated with lower plasma Total Radical-trapping Antioxidant Potential (TRAP) and Vit A. AADD in the most recent month of pregnancy was associated with lower Vit B12 and higher ferritin (which may indicate higher body stores of Fe). The low Zn and Cu in ethanol-exposed women and the lower TRAP and higher ferritin related with alcohol consumption may increase oxidative stress and contribute to alcohol-induced teratogenesis. The association of alcohol consumption with lower Vit B12 and Vit A may also contribute to adverse fetal development.

N2  - Introduction: There is a need for more effective assessment and primary prevention programs aimed at accurately measuring and reducing alcohol consumption before conception in underserved, high-risk populations. Health Information Technology (HIT) may serve this purpose; however, the effectiveness of such tools is not known. Methods: We conducted a small-scale randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an adapted web- based alcohol assessment and intervention tool among low- income, non-pregnant women of reproductive age who were receiving WIC services in San Diego County and who reported currently drinking in a binge pattern. Results: A total of 150 binge-drinking participants completed a web- based assessment and were randomly assigned to either receive a personalized feedback intervention OR general health information about alcohol consumption and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Follow-Up assessments on reported alcohol consumption were conducted via telephone at 1- and 2-months post baseline. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 44 and were predominately Hispanic/Latina (44%). At baseline, all respondents reported consuming >3 standard drinks on >1 occasion in the previous month. Outcome was available for 131 participants. The main outcome measure was reduction in number of risky drinking occasions, and did not differ significantly between treatment conditions, (OR 1.200, 95% CI 0.567-2.539, p=0.634). However, over 70% of the participants reported a reduction in risky drinking occasions regardless of treatment condition (Control 43/63, 68%; Experimental 49/68, 72%). Furthermore, after controlling for confounding in a multivariate hierarchical logistic regression model, the estimate of treatment effect reached borderline significance (OR 2.922, 95% CI 0.991-8.613, p=0.052). Discussion: The results of the present study demonstrate that web-based assessment of alcohol consumption among low-income women of reproductive age, as represented by WIC clients, is feasible and acceptable. The findings also suggest that detailed and interactive assessments of alcohol consumption may be sufficient for the reduction of risky drinking within this population and personalized feedback may be more effective for a subset of individuals.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol (ethanol) during pregnancy can cause a spectrum of structural, cognitive and behavioural anomalies termed the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, there is evidence suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the teratogenic mechanism. To determine the extent to which ROS are involved in FASD, CD-I dams were dosed on gestational day (GD) 9 (plug = GD 1) and exposed to ethanol (4, 6 g/kg low and high dose, respectively) or its vehicle, with or without pretreatment with phenylbutylnitrone (PBN), a free radical spin trapping agent previously shown to reduce embryonic ROS formation and embryopathies caused by teratogens like phenytoin and thalidomide. Ethanol caused dose-dependent teratogenesis that was reduced by pretreatment with PBN. Exposure to 4 g/kg ethanol alone decreased crown-rump length (p < 0.05), while exposure to 6 g/kg ethanol alone decreased fetal weight and crown-rump length, and increased the incidences of resorptions, microcephaly and nasal defects (p < 0.05). Pretreatment of dams with PBN (40 mg/kg) followed by ethanol (4 or 6 g/kg) was protective, evidenced by increases in fetal weight and crown rump-length, as well as decreases in the incidences of microcephaly and nasal defects (p < 0.01) compared to dams exposed to ethanol alone. The reduction in ethanol teratogenesis by PBN pretreatment in mice suggests that ROS may contribute to the FASD.

N2  - In order to explore effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on functional lateralization, item tasks measuring preferences of hand, foot, eye, and ear were administered to a sample of 23 children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) compared with typically developing (TD) children. In addition, a dichotic listening task was administered to a subsample of 11 children with FAS and a TD group of comparable age, sex and handedness. The children with FAS were characterized by increased nonright-handedness compared with TD children. No differences were evident for preferential use of foot, eye, or ear. Moreover, children with FAS displayed more right ear extinctions during dichotic listening relative to TD children, indicating a lack of right ear advantage. The results add to findings of decreased manual asymmetry and less left-lateralized speech perception in children with developmental disorders, and are further discussed in relation to the high incidence of callosal abnormalities in alcohol-exposed children. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Objectives: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a significant public health issue with lifelong psychological, emotional and financial costs associated with caring for an affected individual. In 2005, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch developed evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We examined the extent to which prenatal records across Canadian provinces and territories currently integrate key recommendations from these guidelines. Methods: A content analysis of prenatal record forms retrieved from each Canadian province and territory (N=12) was conducted to identify all questions or intervention prompts related to prenatal screening, exposure assessment, counseling or referral for maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Findings were reviewed in relation to recommendations extrapolated from the Canadian guidelines and the FASD literature. Results: All the prenatal record forms contained questions to assess maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. However, the dimensions of alcohol consumption assessed and the format, wording and number of items related to each dimension varied markedly across provinces/territories. Only five prenatal record forms included a validated screening tool to identify risky alcohol drinking behaviour. Most of the forms lacked prompts to encourage providers to intervene or refer pregnant clients with high-risk drinking behaviour. Conclusion: Integration of the Canadian recommendations into Canadian prenatal record forms may be an effective public health strategy for helping identify pregnancies at high risk for alcohol exposure, reducing the incidence of a FASD through appropriate prenatal intervention and referral, and facilitating early diagnosis of a FASD. © Canadian Public Health Association, 2009.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and research advancements in the field of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) require accurate and valid identification of FASD clinical subgroups. OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive neuropsychological battery, coupled with magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified across the spectrum, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications within the spectrum. The neuropsychological outcomes of the comprehensive neuroimaging study are presented here. METHODS: The study groups included: 1) FAS/Partial FAS; 2) Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed (SE/AE); 3) Neurobehavioral Disorder/Alcohol Exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed by an interdisciplinary team using the FASD 4-Digit Code; and 4) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol. A standardized neuropsychological battery was administered to each child and their primary caregiver by a psychologist. RESULTS: Use of the 4-Digit Code produced three clinically and statistically distinct FASD clinical subgroups. The three subgroups (ND/AE, SE/AE and FAS/PFAS) reflected a linear continuum of increasing neuropsychological impairment and physical abnormality, representing the full continuum of FASD. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders were comparably prevalent across the three FASD groups, and significantly more prevalent than among the Controls. All three FASD subgroups had comparably high levels of prenatal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although ND/AE, SE/AE, and FAS/PFAS are distinct FASD subgroups, these groups are not distinguishable solely by their neuropsychological profiles. While all children within a group shared the same magnitude of neuropsychological impairment, the patterns of impairment showed considerable individual variability. MRI, MRS and fMRI further distinguished these FASD subgroups.

N2  - Alcohol use by pregnant women is a significant public health issue despite well-described risks to the fetus including physical and intellectual growth retardation and malformations. Although clinical studies are limited, they suggest that in utero alcohol exposure also results in significant immune deficiencies in naive neonates. However, little is known about fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) effects on adult infections. Therefore, to determine the long-term effects of FAE on disease susceptibility and the adult immune system, we infected FAE adult mice with influenza virus. In this study, we demonstrate that mice exposed to ethanol during gestation and nursing exhibit enhanced disease severity as well as increased and sustained pulmonary viral titers following influenza virus infection. Secondary exposure to alcohol as an adult further exacerbates these effects. Moreover, we demonstrate that FAE mice have impaired adaptive immune responses, including decreased numbers of virus-specific pulmonary CD8 T cells, a decreased size and frequency of pulmonary B cell foci, and reduced production of influenza-specific Ab following influenza infection. Together, our results suggest that FAE induces significant and long-term defects in immunity and susceptibility to influenza virus infection and that FAE individuals could be at increased risk for severe and fatal respiratory infections.

N2  - This paper highlights gender peculiarities in the neuroscience of alcohol effects and draws attention to emerging problems due to simultaneous exposure to alcohol and environmental factors. All the available gender studies on alcohol show greater severity of alcohol-related damage, including brain damage, in females compared with males. The differences are due to physiological peculiarities that make women more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol. Today the trend to start consuming alcohol at a younger age, together with the growing number of women drinking excessively, is increasing the alcohol-related risks to women's health and justifying the need for better, gender-based studies of alcohol use and abuse. A further aspect to consider in this context is the risk of the occurrence of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders and foetal alcohol syndrome in the offspring of women who drink during pregnancy. Several lines of evidence indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure can influence cell proliferation and differentiation in the central nervous system, causing severe neurotoxicity and permanent birth defects.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Aims: The study researched alcohol consumption and drinking patterns before and during pregnancy. Method: This was a 1 month self report survey of postnatal women from 21 May-22 June 2006. A multiple choice questionnaire was handed out to them on the first or second postnatal day. Results: There were a total of 117 deliveries. The questionnaire was completed by 100 of the 104 women who received it. Before pregnancy, 80% of women reported drinking alcohol; 66% binge drinking. Twenty-eight percent continued consuming alcohol throughout pregnancy. The majority did reduce or stop their alcohol consumption, 7% however did not. Ten percent were drinking more than 2 units per typical day and more than 7 units per week during pregnancy. Four percent was drinking a lot more than this. Nine percent of the total cohort reported binge drinking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Just over a quarter of women drink alcohol throughout pregnancy. A significant minority of women drink relatively heavily (more than 4 units per occasion and multiple times per week) during pregnancy. Many women do reduce their alcohol use because of the pregnancy, but often only after they become aware of it. In New Zealand there is a real risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. ©NZMA.

N2  - Background: Chronic prenatal alcohol exposure causes a spectrum of deleterious effects in offspring, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and deficits in executive function are prevalent in FASD. The goal of this research was to test the hypothesis that children with FASD exhibit performance deficits in tasks that assess attention, planning and spatial working memory. Methods: Subjects (8-15 years male and female children) with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and age- and sex-matched controls, completed four tasks selected from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTABResults: Compared with age-matched control children (n = 92), subjects with FASD (n = 89) exhibited longer reaction and decision times (effect size range; Cohen's d = .51 to .73), suggesting deficits in attention. Children with FASD demonstrated deficits in planning and spatial working memory that became more pronounced when task difficulty increased. The largest effect size in this study population (Cohen's d = 1.1) occurred in the spatial working memory task. Only one outcome measure revealed differences across the diagnostic subgroups, although all groups were different from control. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that deficits in multiple executive function domains, including set shifting, planning and strategy use, attention and spatial working memory, can be assessed in children with FASD using an easy to administer, brief battery of computer-based neuropsychological tasks. The tasks appear to be equally sensitive for brain injury resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol, regardless of the presence of facial dysmorphology. © 2008 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has been consistently linked to neurocognitive deficits and structural brain abnormalities in affected individuals. Structural brain abnormalities observed in regions supporting spatial working memory (SWM) may contribute to observed deficits in visuospatial functioning in youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in alcohol-exposed individuals during a SWM task. There were 22 young subjects (aged 10-18 years) with documented histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 10), and age- and sex-matched controls (CON, n = 12). Subjects performed a SWM task during fMRI that alternated between 2-back location matching (SWM) and simple attention (vigilance) conditions. Results: Groups did not differ on task accuracy or reaction time to the SWM condition, although CON subjects had faster reaction times during the vigilance condition (617 millisecond vs. 684 millisecond, p = 0.03). Both groups showed similar overall patterns of activation to the SWM condition in expected regions encompassing bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal lobes and parietal areas. However, ALC subjects showed greater BOLD response to the demands of the SWM relative to the vigilance condition in frontal, insular, superior, and middle temporal, occipital, and subcortical regions. CON youth evidenced less increased brain activation to the SWM relative to the vigilance task in these areas (p < 0.05, clusters > 1,664 mul). These differences remained significant after including Full Scale IQ as a covariate. Similar qualitative results were obtained after subjects taking stimulant medication were excluded from the analysis. Conclusions: In the context of equivalent performance to a SWM task, the current results suggest that widespread increases in BOLD response in youth with FASDs could either indicate decreased efficiency of relevant brain networks, or serve as a compensatory mechanism for deficiency at neural and/or cognitive levels. In context of existing fMRI evidence of heightened prefrontal activation in response to verbal working memory and inhibition demands, the present findings may indicate that frontal structures are taxed to a greater degree during cognitive demands in individuals with FASDs. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) reflects a constellation of congenital abnormalities caused by excess maternal consumption of alcohol. It is likely that interference with embryonic development plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Ethanol-induced apoptosis has been suggested as a causal factor in the genesis of FAS. Mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells are pluripotent cells that differentiate in vitro to cell aggregates termed embryoid bodies (EBs), wherein differentiation capacity and gene expression profile are similar to those of the early embryo. Methods: To investigate the effects of ethanol during differentiation, mES cells were cultured on a gelatin surface in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor which maintains adherent undifferentiated cells or in suspension to promote formation of EBs. All cells were treated (1-6 days) with 80 mM ethanol. The pluripotency and differentiation of mES cells were evaluated by western blotting of stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA-1), transcription factors Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Nanog, using alkaline phosphatase staining. Apoptosis (early to late stages) was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using TdT-mediated biotin-dUTP nick-end labelling assay and fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Results: Ethanol increased apoptosis during in vitro differentiation of mES cells to EBs, whereas undifferentiated cells were not affected. Ethanol exposure also interfered with pluripotency marker patterns causing an upregulation of SSEA-1 under self-renewal conditions. In EBs, ethanol delayed the downregulation of SSEA-1 and affected the regulation of transcription factors during differentiation. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that ethanol may contribute to the pathogenesis of FAS by triggering apoptotic pathways during differentiation of embryonic stem cells and deregulating early stages of embryogenesis. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a range of disabilities caused by gestational exposure to alcohol. FASD is the leading cause of preventable mental retardation and developmental disability in the United States, with an incidence of 1-10 per 1000 live births. FASD in Israel has yet to be examined systematically. Objectives: To evaluate professionals' experience, awareness and knowledge of FASD in Israel and their awareness of maternal consumption of alcohol, and to collect epidemiological data on the syndrome in Israel. Methods: A short questionnaire was sent to all 43 program directors of genetic institutes (n=14) and child developmental centers in Israel (n=29). Four questions related to their experience and knowledge of FASD. The epidemiological survey included data from all 17 hospitals in Israel and from the two main health management organizations within the public health care system. Results: The response rate was 98% (n=42). A total of 38.1% of respondents reported having diagnosed at least one case of FASD and fewer than 10% of respondents stated that the knowledge regarding FASD among physicians in Israel was adequate. Developmental pediatricians were more likely to have diagnosed at least one case as compared to geneticists. During the period 1998-2007 the diagnosis of FASD appeared in the records of only 4 patients from the total number of 17 hospitals in Israel. During the same period only six patients were diagnosed at the HMO within the public health care system. Conclusions: Despite the accumulated knowledge on FASD in many countries and the increase in alcohol consumption in Israel, professionals' awareness of its potential damage is limited. Educational programs to increase physician awareness should accompany publicity campaigns warning the public of the dangers associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Both executive function deficits and slower processing speed are characteristic of children with fetal alcohol exposure, but the temporal dynamics of neural activity underlying cognitive processing deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder have rarely been studied. To this end, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to examine the nature of alcohol-related effects on response inhibition by identifying differences in neural activation during task performance. Methods: We recorded ERPs during a Go/No-go response inhibition task in 2 groups of children in Cape Town, South Africa (M age = 11.7 years; range = 10 to 13) - one diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (FAS/PFAS; n = 7); the other, a control group whose mothers abstained or drank only minimally during pregnancy (n = 6). Children were instructed to press a "Go" response button to all letter stimuli presented except for the letter "X," the "No-go" stimulus, which occurred relatively infrequently. Results: Task performance accuracy and reaction time did not differ between groups, but differences emerged for 3 ERP components - P2, N2, and P3. The FAS/PFAS group showed a slower latency to peak P2, suggesting less efficient processing of visual information at a relatively early stage (~200 ms after stimulus onset). Moreover, controls showed a larger P2 amplitude to Go versus No-go, indicating an early discrimination between conditions that was not seen in the FAS/PFAS group. Consistent with previous literature on tasks related to cognitive control, the control group showed a well-defined, larger N2 to No-go versus Go, which was not evident in the FAS/PFAS group. Both groups showed the expected larger P3 amplitude to No-go versus Go, but this condition difference persisted in a late slow wave for the FAS/PFAS group, suggesting increased cognitive effort. Conclusions: The timing and amplitude differences in the ERP measures suggest that slower, less efficient processing characterizes the FAS/PFAS group during initial stimulus identification. Moreover, the exposed children showed less sharply defined components throughout the stimulus and response evaluation processes involved in successful response inhibition. Although both groups were able to inhibit their responses equally well, the level of neural activation in the children with FAS/PFAS was greater, suggesting more cognitive effort. The specific deficits in response inhibition processing at discrete stages of neural activation may have implications for understanding the nature of alcohol-related deficits in other cognitive domains as well. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: Several studies have now shown corpus callosum abnormalities using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in comparison with nonexposed controls. The data suggest that posterior regions of the callosum may be disproportionately affected. The current study builds on previous efforts, including our own work, and moves beyond midline corpus callosum to probe major inter-hemispheric white matter pathways with an improved DTI tractographic method. This study also expands on our prior work by evaluating a larger sample and by incorporating children with a broader range of clinical effects including full-criteria fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Methods: Participants included 33 children with FASD (8 FAS, 23 partial FAS, 2 static encephalopathy) and 19 nonexposed controls between the ages of 10 and 17 years. Participants underwent DTI scans and intelligence testing. Groups (FASD vs. controls) were compared on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in 6 white matter tracts projected through the corpus callosum. Exploratory analyses were also conducted examining the relationships between DTI measures in the corpus callosum and measures of intellectual functioning and facial dysmorphology. Results: In comparison with the control group, the FASD group had significantly lower FA in 3 posterior tracts of the corpus callosum: the posterior mid-body, the isthmus, and the splenium. A trend-level finding also suggested lower FA in the genu. Measures of white matter integrity and cognition were correlated and suggest some regional specificity, in that only posterior regions of the corpus callosum were associated with visual-perceptual skills. Correlations between measures of facial dysmorphology and posterior regions of the corpus callosum were nonsignificant. Conclusions: Consistent with previous DTI studies, these results suggest that microstructural posterior corpus callosum abnormalities are present in children with prenatal alcohol exposure and cognitive impairment. These abnormalities are clinically relevant because they are associated with cognitive deficits and appear to provide evidence of abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure independent of dysmorphic features. As such, they may yield important diagnostic and prognostic information not provided by the traditional facial characteristics. Copyright © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Binge drinking during pregnancy might lead to the development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in the offspring. Latinas are often considered a low-risk group for alcohol abuse, although recent reports indicate that the prevalence of alcohol consumption in this group is increasing due to changing cultural norms. The predictors of alcohol consumption during pregnancy among Latinas are largely unknown. We explored predictors of periconceptional drinking among Latinas (n = 155) recruited into an ongoing cohort study at the University of New Mexico. Women were interviewed by a bilingual trained interviewer about any episodes of binge drinking (>4 drinks/occasion) a month around their last menstrual period (LMP) and were administered a TWEAK questionnaire. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and reproductive health characteristics were also ascertained. Predictors of binge drinking were identified by Chi-square test and logistic regression in univariate and multivariable analyses, respectively. Backward selection procedure was used to identify covariates that were independently associated with binge drinking in the final model. The mean age of participants was 27.0 +/- 5.8 years and 69% were foreign born. In the entire sample, 17.4% of pregnant Latinas admitted at least one binge-drinking episode in the month around their LMP. Results of multivariate analysis indicate that Latinas born in the United States have a much greater risk of binge drinking in the periconceptional period (odds ratio [OR] = 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 8.9) compared with foreign-born Latinas. Similarly, Latinas who primarily speak English at home were at much greater risk (OR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 10.5) compared with primarily Spanish-speaking women. No other variables were identified as significant predictors in multivariable models. Our results indicate that more acculturated Latinas are at much greater risk of binge drinking before conception and in early pregnancy compared with less acculturated Latinas. Culturally sensitive interventions should be developed to address risky alcohol consumption among Latinas of reproductive age. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - The role of alcohol in the causation of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) has been firmly established. In most cases events leading to its occurrence have been set into motion prior to conception. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the sole causative agent of FAS, can therefore be prevented even prior to conception by implementation of preconception counseling (PCC). The present review examines the important issues involved in the implementation of PCC for the prevention of FAS which can be of immense help to the affected population.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at microscopic levels, provides unprecedented opportunities to aid in defining the full spectrum of ethanol's insult to the developing brain. This is the first in a series of reports that, collectively, will provide an MRM-based atlas of developmental stage-dependent structural brain abnormalities in a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) mouse model. The ethanol exposure time and developmental stage examined for this report is gestational day (GD) 8 in mice, when the embryos are at early neurulation stages; stages present in humans early in the fourth week postfertilization. Methods: For this study, pregnant C57Bl/6J mice were administered an ethanol dosage of 2.8 g/kg intraperitoneally at 8 days, 0 hour and again at 8 days, 4 hours postfertilization. On GD 17, fetuses that were selected for MRM analyses were immersion fixed in a Bouin's/Prohance solution. Control fetuses from vehicle-treated dams were stage-matched to those that were ethanol-exposed. The fetal mice were scanned ex vivo at 7.0 T and 512 x 512 x 1024 image arrays were acquired using 3-D spin warp encoding. The resulting 29 mum (isotropic) resolution images were processed using ITK-SNAP, a 3-D segmentation/ visualization tool. Linear and volume measurements were determined for selected brain, head, and body regions of each specimen. Comparisons were made between control and treated fetuses, with an emphasis on determining (dis)proportionate changes in specific brain regions. Results: As compared with controls, the crown-rump lengths of stage-matched ethanol-exposed GD 17 fetuses were significantly reduced, as were brain and whole body volumes. Volume reductions were notable in every brain region examined, with the exception of the pituitary and septal region, and were accompanied by increased ventricular volumes. Disproportionate regional brain volume reductions were most marked on the right side and were significant for the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum; the latter being the most severely affected. Additionally, the septal region and the pituitary were disproportionately large. Linear measures were consistent with those of volume. Other dysmorphologic features noted in the MR scans were choanal stenosis and optic nerve coloboma. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that exposure to ethanol occurring in mice at stages corresponding to the human fourth week postfertilization results in structural brain abnormalities that are readily identifiable at fetal stages of development. In addition to illustrating the utility of MR microscopy for analysis of an FASD mouse model, this work provides new information that confirms and extends human clinical observations. It also provides a framework for comparison of structural brain abnormalities resulting from ethanol exposure at other developmental stages and dosages. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this pilot study was to explore possible ultrasound parameters for the early detection of alcohol-mediated fetal somatic and central nervous system (CNS) maldevelopment. Maternal alcohol ingestion during pregnancy may lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which encompass a broad range of structural abnormalities including growth impairment, specific craniofacial features and CNS abnormalities. Early detection of fetuses at risk of FASD would support earlier interventions. Methods: We performed a longitudinal prospective pilot study from 2004 to 2006 at two sites in Ukraine. A sample of pregnant women who reported consuming moderate-to-heavy amounts of alcohol participated in a comprehensive maternal interview, and received ultrasound evaluation of fetal growth and specific fetal brain measurements during the second and third trimesters. These measurements were compared with those collected from a group of pregnant women who consumed little-to-no alcohol during pregnancy, and who were recruited and followed in the same manner. Results: From 6745 screened women, 84 moderate-to-heavy alcohol users and 82 comparison women were identified and ultrasound examinations performed. After controlling for maternal smoking, alcohol-exposed fetuses had shorter mean femur length, caval-calvarial distance and frontothalamic measurements in the second trimester (P < 0.05), and alcohol-exposed fetuses also had shorter frontothalamic distance measurements in the third trimester relative to comparison fetuses (P < 0.05). In addition, after controlling for maternal smoking, both mean orbital diameter and biparietal diameter measurements were significantly smaller on average in the alcohol-exposed group in the third trimester relative to comparison fetuses (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Significant differences in selected somatic and brain measurements were noted between alcoholexposed and comparison fetuses, suggesting these markers may be further explored for clinical utility in prenatal identification of affected children. Further study correlating these findings with alcohol-related physical features of the newborn and subsequent comparisons of neurodevelopmental outcomes will help define potential uses of prenatal ultrasound for intervention and prevention of FASD.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), resulting from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, are associated with significant academic and behavior problems. Although affected children are common in clinical practice, information to guide recommendations about interventions with this high risk group is very limited. This study evaluated the persistence of effects of an intervention on the math performance and behavior of 54 children, 3- to 10-years, diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome or FASD. METHODS: Children were randomly assigned to a 6-week Math intervention (n = 28) tailored to this clinical group or to a standard psychoeducational contrast group (n = 26). All caregivers received identical educational interventions to promote learning readiness and improve behavioral outcomes. In a previous study, participants were assessed before interventions and immediately following completion. In this follow-up study, participants were recontacted and reassessed at 6 months post completion to determine if positive results on math functioning and child behavior would persist after treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: Focus was on 2 outcomes: (1) Math performance, assessed using standardized measures of math achievement and (2) Behavior problems as reported by caregivers on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teachers on the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Experimental-group participants demonstrated significantly greater scores on math outcome measures than Contrast group members and CBCL and TRF behavior was improved over pretest scores in both groups. CONCLUSION: This 6-month follow-up confirms that both math skills and behavior of alcohol-affected children are improved significantly by interventions designed to meet their specific learning and behavior needs. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - This study evaluated the neural basis of verbal working memory (WM) function in a group of 20 children and adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) and 20 typically developing comparison participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both groups showed prominent activation in the frontal-parietal-cerebellar network known to be important for verbal WM. Despite equivalent behavioral performance between groups, alcohol-exposed individuals showed increased activation relative to typically developing individuals in left dorsal frontal and left inferior parietal cortices, and bilateral posterior temporal regions during verbal WM. These effects remained even when group differences on IQ were statistically controlled. This pattern of increased activation coupled with equivalent behavioral performance between groups suggests that individuals with FASD recruit a more extensive network of brain regions during verbal WM relative to typically developing individuals. These findings may suggest that frontal-parietal processing during verbal WM is less effi-cient in alcohol-exposed individuals. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance (MR) technology offers noninvasive methods for in vivo assessment of neuroabnormalities. Methods: A comprehensive neuropsychological/psychiatric battery, coupled with MR imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) assessments, were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the spectrum. The 4 study groups included: (i) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (PFAS); (ii) static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed (SE/AE); (iii) neurobehavioral disorder/alcohol exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed with the FASD 4-Digit Code; and (iv) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure. Presented here are the MRI assessments that were used to compare the sizes of brain regions between the 4 groups. The neuropsychological/behavioral, MRS, and fMRI outcomes are reported separately. Results: Progressing across the 4 study groups from Controls to ND/AE to SE/AE to FAS/PFAS, the mean absolute size of the total brain, frontal lobe, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, cerebellar vermis, and corpus callosum length decreased incrementally and significantly. The FAS/PFAS group (the only group with the 4-Digit FAS facial phenotype) had disproportionately smaller frontal lobes relative to all other groups. The FAS/PFAS and SE/AE groups [the 2 groups with the most severe central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction] had disproportionately smaller caudate regions relative to the ND/AE and Control groups. The prevalence of subjects in the FAS/PFAS, SE/AE, and ND/AE groups that had 1 or more brain regions, 2 or more SDs below the mean size observed in the Control group was 78, 58, and 43%, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between size of brain regions and level of prenatal alcohol exposure, magnitude of FAS facial phenotype, and level of CNS dysfunction. Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging provided further validation that ND/AE, SE/AE, and FAS/PFAS as defined by the FASD 4-Digit Code are 3 clinically distinct and increasingly more affected diagnostic subclassifications under the umbrella of FASD. Neurostructural abnormalities are present across the spectrum. MRI could importantly augment diagnosis of conditions under the umbrella of FASD, once population-based norms for structural development of the human brain are established.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Clinical studies and research in animals have established that alcohol consumption during pregnancy produces irreversible developmental anomalies. Deficits in fine motor performance are often noted in infants diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. However, the effects of alcohol on the spinal motoneurons have not been examined. In this study, the morphometric alterations in spinal motoneurons were assessed as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered with 1.0 ml of 20% ethyl alcohol per 100 gm body weight via intraperitoneal injections, and unexposed rats served as controls. Rats were perfused through the left cardiac ventricle and a complete laminectomy was performed. Spinal cord sections from the L4-5 segments were cut serially and stained for cresyl fast violet. Sections were also subjected to TUNEL assay for detection of apoptosis. Observations were made between 1 and 4 weeks after birth. RESULTS: Morphologic characteristics of motoneurons in the alcoholexposed group of rats were altered. Counts and measurements revealed significant reduction in number and size of alcohol-exposed spinal motoneurons at all time points studied. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to alcohol showed cytotoxic effects whereby it adversely affected both motoneuron growth and differentiation in utero. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Despite decades of research, the aetiology of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD) remains largely unknown. Next to a strong genetic component, increasing evidence suggests additional adverse impact of environmental factors, two of which have, although controversially, withstood meta-analysis: gestational exposure to smoking (OR 2.39) and low birth weight (OR 2.64). Several studies have investigated a possible association between prenatal exposure to alcohol and ADHD, although the matter is complicated due to foetal alcohol syndrome disorders (FASD) with ADHD-like symptoms. Questions: Can an estimate of the effect of gestational exposure to alcohol for ADHD be determined? What is the relevance of primary care services in screening and intervention in mild to moderate drinking in pregnant women? Method: MEDLINE, Cinahl, PsychInfo, EMBASE (1995-2008) were searched for articles in English, supplemented by a manual search. Out of 23 reviewed studies, three were included in the meta-analysis; one further study was added to undertake a sub-analysis comparing severe versus mild alcohol consumption. Summary odds ratios (OR) were extracted and fixed/random-effects meta-analysis were used for combining the OR's. Heterogeneity across the studies was formally assessed using Cochran's Q. Results: An OR of 2.33 (95% CI, 1.18-4.61), (z = 2.43, p = 0.02) suggests that exposed children are 2.33 times more likely to have ADHD than non exposed children. Discussion: Our meta-analysis suggests that children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy are at risk for ADHD. However, evidence is sparse and it remains uncertain whether a causal association exists. Further research is needed into dose-response relationship, timing of exposure, influence of genetic factors involved inmaternal alcohol abuse and the role of FASD in ADHD-like symptoms. If a detrimental effect of mild to moderate drinking on the offspring is supported by stronger evidence, primary care services could have a major role in prevention and early intervention. This would be in addition to their already established role in helping heavy drinking mothers. © 2009 Royal College of General Practitioners.

N2  - Background: Previous research has demonstrated that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure affects the size and shape of the corpus callosum (CC) and compromises interhemispheric transfer of information. The aim of this study was to confirm the previous reports of poorer performance on a finger localization test (FLT) of interhemispheric transfer in a cohort of heavily exposed children and to extend these findings to a cohort of moderately exposed young adults. Methods: In Study 1, the FLT was administered to 40 heavily exposed and 23 nonexposed children from the Cape Coloured community of Cape Town, South Africa, who were evaluated for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) dysmorphology and growth. Anatomical images of the CC were obtained using structural MRI on a subset of these children. In Study 2, the FLT was administered to a cohort of 85 moderate-to-heavily exposed young adults participating in a 19-year follow-up assessment of the Detroit Prenatal Alcohol Exposure cohort, whose alcohol exposure had been ascertained prospectively during gestation. Results: In Study 1, children with FAS showed more transfer-related errors than controls after adjustment for confounding, and increased transfer-related errors were associated with volume reductions in the isthmus and splenium of the CC. In Study 2, transfer-related errors were associated with quantity of alcohol consumed per occasion during pregnancy. More errors were made if the mother reported binge drinking (>5 standard drinks) during pregnancy than if she drank regularly (M > 1 drink/day) without binge drinking. Conclusions: These findings confirm a previous report of impaired interhemispheric transfer of tactile information in children heavily exposed to alcohol in utero and extend these findings to show that these deficits are also seen in more moderately exposed individuals, particularly those exposed to binge-like pregnancy drinking. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Exposure to ethanol during prenatal development can have devastating consequences on developing fetuses, the so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disordres (FASD). Among FASD, cases that exhibit all of three criterion; 1) central nervous system dysfunction, 2) prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and 3) characteristic cranial/facial abnormalities, referred as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children born to drinking mothers may suffer from severe brain damage that is expressed by a variety of behavioral alterations. We examined the effects of ethanol exposure during brain development on brain morphogenesis and circadian rhythm using a rat model. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a liquid diet containing 2.5-5.0% (w/v) ethanol during gestational days 10 to 21. Mean daily ethanol consumption by these dams was 11.53 +/- 2.54 g/kg/day. In rats prenatally exposed to ethanol, ectopias on the cerebral cortex, aberrant distribution of hippocampal mossy fibers, and fusion of cerebellar folia were found. Rats exposed to ethanol during the prenatal or postnatal period suffered from a fragile synchronizing system of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Although the prevalence of FAS in Japan is lower than in the United States, the increasing number of Japanese women with the drinking habit are cause for great concern. However, the preventive action of FAS/FASD has been advanced recently, and now alcoholic beverages carry labels warning of the risk of drinking during pregnancy and breastfeeding of babies. Although little is still known about how ethanol affects brain development, the only and most certain way to prevent FAS/FASD is total abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. To describe the clinical features of American Indian children born just before and just after a sibling with fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome. METHODS. Two retrospective case-control studies were conducted of Northern Plains American Indian children with fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome identified from 1981 to 1993 by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 760.71. RESULTS. Compared with the controls, the 39 siblings born just before children with fetal alcohol syndrome (study 1) and 30 siblings born just before children with incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome (study 2) had more facial dysmorphology (23.1% and 16.7%, respectively), growth delay (38.5% and 10.0%), and central nervous system impairment (48.7% and 33.3%). The 20 siblings born just after children with fetal alcohol syndrome (study 1) and 22 siblings born just after children with incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome (study 2) had more facial dysmorphology (20.0% and 9.1%, respectively), growth delay (45.0% and 22.7%), and central nervous system impairment (50.0% and 31.8%) than the control siblings.CONCLUSIONS. The "before" siblings had characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome that could have predicted that the next child was at risk for fetal alcohol syndrome. The "after" siblings had better outcomes than the previous siblings with fetal alcohol syndrome, a finding that was associated with a decrease in maternal alcohol consumption during the after-sibling pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of fetal alcohol exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability in the first one and a half years of life. Four models describing the interplay of these factors were assessed: A direct effect model, an interaction or threshold model, a mediational model and a transactional model. Method: A sample of initially 458 women was assessed in a prospective 3-wave study across the first 17 months after childbirth. Fetal alcohol exposure was questioned retrospectively six weeks after birth. Infant irritability was reported by the mothers and fathers. Results: Support for the direct effect model and the interaction model could be found: Fetal alcohol exposure and low emotional support from the husband were associated with increased infant irritability at 5 months. The impact of fetal alcohol exposure was moderated by postnatal depressive symptoms. More irritability was reported if both risk factors, prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal depressive symptoms, were present. Infant irritability and maternal depressive symptoms were associated cross-sectionally. At the age of 17 months only a main effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on irritability could be found. Conclusion: Direct effects of fetal alcohol exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability as well as an interaction between fetal alcohol exposure and maternal depressive symptoms were revealed. The interaction can be understood in terms of a diathesis-stress model. However, no longitudinal associations between maternal depressive symptoms and infant irritability could be found. © 2009 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs), including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, continue to be high-incidence developmental disorders. Detection of patterns of maternal drinking that place fetuses at risk for these disorders is critical to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, but is challenging and often insufficient during pregnancy. Various screens and measures have been used to identify maternal risk drinking but their ability to predict child outcome has been inconsistent. This study hypothesized that a metric of fetal "at-risk" alcohol exposure (ARAE) derived from several indicators of maternal self-reported drinking would predict alcohol-related neurobehavioral dysfunctions in children better than individual measures of maternal alcohol consumption alone. Methods: Self-reported peri-conceptional and repeated maternal drinking during pregnancy were assessed with semi-structured interviews and standard screens, i.e., the CAGE, T-ACE, and MAST, in a prospective sample of 75 African-American mothers. Drinking volumes per beverage type were converted to standard quantity and frequency measures. From these individual measures and screening instruments, a simple dichotomous index of prenatal ARAE was defined and used to predict neurobehavioral outcomes in the 4- to 5-year-old offspring of these women. Study outcomes included IQ, attention, memory, visual-motor integration, fine motor skill, and behavior. Statistical analyses controlled for demographic and other potential confounders. Results: The current "at-risk" drinking metric identified over 62% of the mothers as drinking at risk levels - 23% more than the selection criterion identified - and outperformed all individual quantity and frequency consumption measures, including averages of weekly alcohol use and "binge" alcohol exposures (assessed as intake per drinking occasion), as well as an estimate of the Maternal Substance Abuse Checklist (Coles et al., 2000), in predicting prenatal alcohol-related cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in 4- to 5-year-old children. Conclusions: A metric reflecting multiple indices of "at-risk" maternal alcohol drinking in pregnancy had greater utility in predicting various prenatal alcohol-related neurobehavioral dysfunction and deficits in children compared to individual measures of maternal self-reported alcohol consumption or a previous maternal substance abuse index. Assessing fetal risk drinking in pregnant women was improved by including multiple indicators of both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences and, if appropriate practical applications are devised, may facilitate intervention by health care workers during pregnancy and potentially reduce the incidence or severity of FASDs.

N2  - Aim: To identify factors contributing to growth failure in international adoptees (IAs) from Eastern Europe. Study design: 138 IAs from Eastern Europe, 6-59 months old, were evaluated within 3 weeks of US arrival. Complete history, anthropometry, and serum for growth factors were obtained. Facial features were examined for risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. Results: Upon arrival, mean height (-1.23 +/- 1.07), weight (-1.43 +/- 1.29), and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) (-0.63+/-1.10) SDS in las were significantly less than population means for US children. In a multiple regression model, age, low birth weight (LBW), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, and high risk for fetal alcohol syndrome were independent predictors of height SDS. LBW also independently predicted lower weight SDS and smaller OFC SDS. Conclusions: We recommend that IAs undergo screening upon US arrival to identify risk factors for poor growth, particularly evidence of LBW and fetal alcohol exposure. Catch-up growth should be monitored in all children following adoption. © Freund Publishing House Ltd., London.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is the most common environmental factor leading to congenital birth defects in the United States. Although significant progress has been made in this field, the detailed molecular pathology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) remains to be determined. Previously, we have shown that alcohol exposure perturbs hedgehog signal transduction in zebrafish embryos by inhibiting the post-translational cholesterol modification of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), leading to decreased levels of mature Shh ligand that is associated with the plasma membrane, and causing transient loss of Hh signaling, resulting in permanent FAS-related morphological abnormalities. In the present study, we further elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the intracellular transportation and secretion of Shh using the hepatic stellate cell line HSC8B. We have found that Shh is associated with caveolin-1 in the Golgi apparatus to form protein complexes and that these complexes are packaged as large punctuate structures (transport vesicles) that are transported to the plasma membrane in lipid raft microdomains. Alcohol exposure does not significantly interrupt translation of shh mRNA in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the trafficking of Shh from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. However, alcohol does prevent the entry of Shh into transport vesicles from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and specifically decreases the amount of caveolin-1/Shh complex found in lipid rafts, causing cytoplasmic accumulation of Shh and leading to a deficiency of Shh ligand secretion into the extracellular matrix. © 2009 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized by physical deformities and learning and memory deficits. The chick hippocampus, whose functions are controlled by interneurons expressing calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR), is involved in learning and memory mechanisms. Effects on growth and development and hippocampal morphology were studied in chick embryos exposed to 5% and 10% ethanol volume/volume (vol/vol) for 2 or 8 days of gestation. There was a significant dose-dependent reduction (P < .05) in body weight and mean number per section of PV and CR expressing hippocampal neurons in ethanol-exposed chicks, without alterations in neuronal nuclear size or hippocampal volume, compared appropriate controls. Moreover, when chicks exposed to 5% ethanol for 2 and 8 days of gestation were compared, no significant differences were found in body parameters or neuronal counts. Similarly, exposure to 10% ethanol did not induce any significant changes in chicks exposed for 2 or 8 gestational days. Thus, these results suggest that gestational ethanol exposure induces a reduction in the mean number per section of PV and CR expressing hippocampal neurons, and could be a possible mechanism responsible for learning and memory disorders in FAS. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Exposure to alcohol during gestation is associated with CNS alterations, cognitive deficits, and behavior problems. This study investigated microstructural aspects of putative white matter abnormalities following prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess white matter microstructure in 27 youth (age range: 8 to 18 years) with (n = 15) and without (n = 12) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Voxelwise analyses, corrected for multiple comparisons, compared fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between groups, throughout the cerebrum. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with low FA in multiple cerebral areas, including the body of the corpus callosum and white matter innervating bilateral medial frontal and occipital lobes. Fewer between-group differences in MD were observed. Conclusions: These data provide an account of cerebral white matter microstructural integrity in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and support extant literature showing that white matter is a target of alcohol teratogenesis. The white matter anomalies characterized in this study may relate to the neurobehavioral sequelae associated with gestational alcohol exposure, especially in areas of executive dysfunction and visual processing deficits. © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Seizures are often found in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, but it is not known whether binge drinking during pregnancy by nonalcoholic women is associated with an increased risk of seizure disorders in children. The authors conducted a population-based cohort study of 80,526 liveborn singletons in the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996-2002). Information on maternal binge drinking (intake of >5 drinks on a single occasion) was collected in 2 computer-assisted telephone interviews during pregnancy. Children were followed for up to 8 years. Information on neonatal seizures, epilepsy, and febrile seizures was retrieved from the Danish National Hospital Register. Results showed that exposure to binge drinking episodes during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of seizure disorders in children, except for those exposed at 11-16 gestational weeks. These children had a 3.15-fold increased risk of neonatal seizures (95% confidence interval: 1.37, 7.25) and a 1.81-fold increased risk of epilepsy (95% confidence interval: 1.13, 2.90). These findings suggest that maternal binge drinking during a specific time period of pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of specific seizure disorders in the offspring. The results are exploratory, however, and need to be replicated. © The Author 2008. Published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Cell death and differentiations are the critical processes in developing fetal brain, where ethanol induces lots of changes in gene expression patterns of fetal nervous system leading to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The objective of the present study was to observe whether maternal ethanol exposure can alter gene expression pattern in mother and in fetus during mid and late prenatal stage. Material/Methods: 10% ethanol was orally applied to female Spraque-Dawley rats and fetuses were sacrificed on gestational day (GD) 19.5 and 21.5. Total mRNA was isolated for differential-display PCR (DD-PCR) and sequence was analyzed to find out the homologous gene(s) using GenBank database of the BLAST program. Finally, the gene expression pattern in different maternal and fetal brain areas of the control and the ethanol treated groups were studied by RNase protection assay (RPA) and in situ hybridization. Results: Out of several differentially expressed genes, apoptosis-related RNA binding protein (RBP), 'Napor-3' mRNA expression was significantly inhibited by ethanol in fetal rat fore-, mid- and hind- brain, and adult rat cortex and hippocampus when compared with the untreated control. The cDNA analysis was further supported our result (accession: AF090697, 95% sequence homology). Conclusions: The age and area dependent suppression of apoptosis-related RBP, Napor-3 gene expression in proliferating fetal brain by maternal ethanol suggesting high susceptibility towards ethanol intake at the time of neuronal cell development and proliferation. Further, ethanol also affects maternal brain tissues that may be one of the reasons for ethanol-induce irreversible damage of the developing brain. The present study for the first time provides the evidence that Napor-3 suppression by ethanol during mid and late stage fetal brain converts natural physiological event apoptosis into pathological process, which may be useful as a novel therapeutic approach towards FAS-associated developmental brain damage as a consequence of maternal drinking behavior. © Med Sci Monit, 2009.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Mediators of susceptibility to alcohol-related toxicity in the prenatal environment are relatively unknown. The placenta has been proposed as a potential source of variability in the fetal environment, primarily through its significant metabolic capabilities. Meconium is a toxicological matrix unique to the developing fetus that offers an opportunity to quantify fetal exposure to alcohol through the analysis of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) [nonoxidative ethanol metabolites]. Objective: To explore the role of the placenta as a potential source of variability in mediating fetal alcohol exposure via meconium analysis of FAEE, by combining a clinical case report involving human dizygotic twins and a series of guinea pig littermates. Methods: Meconium was collected from a pair of dizygotic twins with clinical suspicion of prenatal alcohol exposure and analyzed for FAEE to confirm prenatal alcohol exposure. Meconium was also collected from a series of guinea pig pups prenatally exposed to alcohol at a daily dose of 4 g/kg/day administered to the pregnant dam. FAEE levels were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection following liquid-liquid extraction from meconium. Results: The dizygotic twin pair yielded positive meconium FAEE results (>2.00 nmoL/g) in the female twin (2.21 nmoL/g) and no detectable FAEE in the male twin. A total of 15 meconium samples were collected from 15 pups of five pregnant guinea pig litters. With the exception of one pair of littermates, meconium FAEE concentrations differed substantially within each litter (FAEE expressed in units of nmoL/g): litter 1 (0.996, 4.43, 1.36); litter 2 (5.17, 4.15, 0.00); litter 3 (5.16, 5.27); litter 4 (18.57, 8.26, 7.46); litter 5 (0.00, 4.32, 0.00, 1.27). Conclusions: Identical maternal ethanol exposure levels produced differing levels of fetal exposure in a dizygotic human twin pair and a series of guinea pig littermates as evidenced through FAEE meconium analysis. These data indicate that the placenta may have a previously unappreciated role in mediating ethanol-induced fetal injury. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)is the leading cause of mental retardation worldwide but is also the foremost preventable cause of neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities. It is equally important to know spectrum of disorders due to maternal alcoholism during pregnancy such as Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD)in order to identify and treat affected child and family effectively. This article aims to create awareness among practising clinicians most of whom are only aware of phenotypical variant of FASD which is FAS.In this article we discuss those aspects of FASD relevant to the clinician such as: terminological ambiguity, assessment, diagnosis and prevention. © 2009 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a major cause of mental retardation in Western countries. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is mainly characterized by pre- and postnatal stunted growth, neurocognitive disorders, and facial dysmorphism. It compromises the intellectual and behavioral prognosis of the child. Prevention tools exist, through better information of health professionals, for optimal care of high-risk women before, during, and after pregnancy, which would decrease the incidence of SAF in the future. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

T1  - GSK3beta in ethanol neurotoxicity
A1  - Luo J.
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health problem and may result in a wide range of adverse outcomes for the child. The developing central nervous system (CNS) is particularly susceptible to ethanol toxicity. Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments. FASD currently represents the leading cause of mental retardation in North America ahead of Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Ethanol exposure during development causes multiple abnormalities in the brain such as permanent loss of neurons, ectopic neurons, and alterations in synaptogenesis and myelinogenesis. These alcohol-induced structural alterations in the developing brain underlie many of the behavioral deficits observed in FASD. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of ethanol neurotoxicity, however, remain unclear. Ethanol elicits cellular stresses, including oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, responds to various cellular stresses. GSK3beta is particularly abundant in the developing CNS, and regulates diverse developmental events in the immature brain, such as neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, migration, and survival. Available evidence indicates that the activity of GSK3beta in the CNS is affected by ethanol. GSK3beta inhibition provides protection against ethanol neurotoxicity, whereas high GSK3beta activity/expression sensitizes neuronal cells to ethanol-induced damages. It appears that GSK3beta is a converging signaling point that mediates some of ethanol's neurotoxic effects. © 2009 Humana Press Inc.

N2  - Magnetic resonance (MR) technology offers noninvasive methods for in vivo assessment of neuroabnormalities. A comprehensive neuropsychological/behavioral, MR imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS) and functional MRI (fMRI) assessment was administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine whether global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified and to distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the spectrum. The four study groups included (1) FAS/partial FAS; (2) static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed (SE/AE); (3) neurobehavioral disorder/alcohol exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed with the FASD 4-Digit Code; and (4) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure. Results are presented in four separate reports: MRS (reported here) and neuropsychological/behavioral, MRI and fMRI outcomes (reported separately). MRS was used to compare neurometabolite concentrations [choline (Cho), n-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and creatine (Cre)] in a white matter region and a hippocampal region between the four study groups. Choline concentration in the frontal/parietal white matter region, lateral to the midsection of the corpus callosum, was significantly lower in FAS/PFAS relative to all other study groups. Choline decreased significantly with decreasing frontal white matter volume and corpus callosum length. These outcomes suggest low choline concentrations may reflect white matter deficits among FAS/PFAS. Choline also decreased significantly with increasing severity of the 4-Digit FAS facial phenotype, increasing impairment in psychological performance and increasing alcohol exposure. NAA and Cre concentrations did not vary significantly. This study provides further evidence of the vulnerability of the cholinergic system in FASD. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can damage the fetal brain and lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Despite public warnings discouraging alcohol use during pregnancy, many pregnant women continue to drink intermittently because they do not believe that occasional exposures to alcohol can be harmful to a fetus. However, because of genetic differences, some fetuses are much more susceptible than others to alcohol-induced brain injury. Thus, a relatively low quantity of alcohol that may be innocuous to most fetuses could damage a genetically susceptible fetus. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) can protect developing mouse neurons against alcohol toxicity by synthesizing neuroprotective nitric oxide. This study examined whether a single exposure to alcohol, which causes no evident injury in wild type mice, can damage the brains of mice genetically deficient for nNOS (nNOS-/- mice). Wild type and nNOS-/- mice received intraperitoneal injections of alcohol (0.0, 2.2, or 4.4 mg/g body weight) either as a single dose on postnatal day (PD) 4 or as repeated daily doses over PD4-9. Brain volumes and neuronal numbers within the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were determined on PD10. Alcohol exposure on PD4-9 restricted brain growth and caused neuronal death in both strains of mice, but the severity of microencephaly and neuronal loss were more severe in the nNOS-/- mice than in wild type. The 4.4 mg/g alcohol dose administered on PD4 alone caused significant neuronal loss and microencephaly in the nNOS-/- mice, while this same dose caused no evident injury in the wild type mice. Thus, during development, a single exposure to alcohol can injure a genetically vulnerable brain, while it leaves a wild type brain unaffected. Since the genes that confer alcohol resistance and vulnerability in developing humans are unknown, any particular human fetus is potentially vulnerable. Thus, women should be counseled to consume no alcohol during pregnancy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can affect brain development, leading to behavioral problems, including overactivity, motor dysfunction and learning deficits. Despite warnings about the effects of drinking during pregnancy, rates of fetal alcohol syndrome remain unchanged and thus, there is an urgent need to identify interventions that reduce the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is neuroprotective against ethanol-related toxicity and promotes white matter production following a number of insults. Given that prenatal alcohol leads to cell death and white matter deficits, the present study examined whether IGF-I could reduce the severity of behavioral deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure. Sprague-Dawley rat pups received ethanol intubations (5.25 g/kg/day) or sham intubations on postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester. On PD 10-13, subjects from each treatment received 0 or 10 mug IGF-I intranasally each day. Subjects were then tested on a series of behavioral tasks including open field activity (PD 18-21), parallel bar motor coordination (PD 30-32) and Morris maze spatial learning (PD 45-52). Ethanol exposure produced overactivity, motor coordination impairments, and spatial learning deficits. IGF-I treatment significantly mitigated ethanol's effects on motor coordination, but not on the other two behavioral tasks. These data indicate that IGF-I may be a potential treatment for some of ethanol's damaging effects, a finding that has important implications for children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation.Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that plays an important role in neuronal development and survival as well as in synaptic and morphological plasticity. Our objective was to delineate BDNF expression during embryonic development and evaluate if prenatal alcohol exposure effects BDNF expression in mouse embryos and young-adult mouse brains. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g) or placebo. Embryos were harvested at 6h(E8), 24h(E9), day 10(E18) and pups at postnatal day 40 (PND40). Each sample included at least 3 embryos or brains, representing at least 3 litters per time point. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time PCR was performed to quantify BDNF with HPRT1 standardization. Statistics included ANOVA and Fisher PLSD. RESULTS: BDNF expression was higher in E8 compared to E9 and E18 in control embryos. At 6h, BDNF expression in the alcohol-exposed embryos was lower than in controls (P<.05); at 24h and E18 BDNF was higher in the alcohol-exposed embryos than the controls (all P<.05). We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults hippocampus and cortex (all P>.05). {Figure presented} CONCLUSION: Prenatal alcohol exposure during development induces a decrease in BDNF expression 6h after the alcohol exposure and an increase after 24h and 10 days, without differences in the young-adult brain. Alterations in BDNF expression during development may underlie some of the of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation; prenatal alcohol exposure affects the development of the nervous system. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that is essential in normal neuronal development and survival as well as synaptic plasticity, an important factor in learning and memory. Previously, we have shown that prenatal treatment with neuroprotective peptides, NAP+SAL, prevented alcohol induced fetal anomalies and learning deficits. Our objective was to evaluate if NAP+SAL's neuroprotective effects are mediated by preventing alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression during embryonic development. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides (20g, 30 min before alcohol). Embryos were harvested at 6h(E8), 24h(E9) and day 10(E18). Each sample included at least 3 embryos, representing at least 3 litters per time point. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time PCR was performed to quantify BDNF with HPRT1 standardization. Statistics included ANOVA and Fisher PLSD. RESULTS: At 6h pretreatment with NAP + SAL did not prevent the alcohol-induced decline in BDNF (P=0.9). However, pretreatment with the peptides NAP+SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P<0.05) at 24h and E18. {Figure presented} CONCLUSION: NAP+SAL prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24h and 10 days after alcohol exposure. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies and learning deficits in fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinical manifestations of FASD are highly variable and include physical, mental and growth retardation, and multiple organ defects. The complex and diverse response of fetal cells to ethanol has prompted us to use a bioinformatics approach to study the effect of ethanol on fetal stem cells derived from the amniotic fluid (AFSCs). Large-scale transcriptome analysis of ethanol-treated AFSC showed pathways involved in skeletal development and ossification were up-regulated, suggesting a basis for ethanol-induced skeletal malformations in vivo. We therefore examined ethanol's effect on osteogenic differentiation of AFSC. Ethanol treatment during the first 48 hours of osteogenic differentiation increased calcium deposition, and increased both gene and protein expression of alkaline phosphatase. In contrast, ethanol treatment at a midpoint of differentiation (day 8) had no significant effect on the protein expression of alkaline phosphatase. These results suggest that transient exposure of AFSC to ethanol during early differentiation has long-term effects and enhances osteogenic diffferentiation as indicated by an increase in bone-specific markers and calcium deposition.

N2  - Children exposed prenatally to alcohol may present with a broad range of problems, referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Neurodevelopmental deficits in these children include both primary problems related to central nervous system alterations, and secondary problems including an increased prevalence of depression and addiction. Alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) function are related to depression and addiction, and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters HPA function. Using our model of PAE, key brain regions were investigated in males and females following exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS) in adulthood. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley females were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: 1) Alcohol (ethanol, E)-liquid diet containing 36% ethanolderived calories; 2) Pair-fed (PF)-isocaloric liquid diet with maltose-dextrin substituted for ethanol, g/kg body wt/day of gestation; and 3) Control (C)-lab chow ad libitum. In adulthood, male and female offspring were either left undisturbed or were subjected to a 10 day CMS regimen. All animals were sacrificed on day 11 under basal conditions, and brains were analyzed for mRNA levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Preliminary evidence suggests that CRH mRNA levels did not differ among prenatal groups within the PVN, but were altered in the basolateral amygdala of E male and female rats. Interestingly, sex differences in CRH mRNA levels in response to stress were observed in E animals. In summary, region- and sexspecific alterations in CRH mRNA following CMS were observed, with differential effects among prenatal treatment groups.

N2  - Nearly half of U.S. pregnancies are "unplanned". Although many women significantly reduce their alcohol use once they know they are pregnant, a large number of women do not realize they are pregnant until they are well into the first trimester. Because the early weeks of pregnancy are considered a critical period of fetal susceptibility to the actions of alcohol, alcohol-related birth defects may become established before a woman is aware she is pregnant. Therefore, to avoid an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP), it is critical to intervene with women prior to conception to help them reduce risky drinking and/or improve contraception. The CDC funded a comprehensive program of research to develop and test a preconception intervention to address risky alcohol use and ineffective contraception in an effort to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Project CHOICES was developed through a series of CDC funded initiatives. Project CHOICES Epidemiology Study (n=2,672): This first study was funded to identify settings with high prevalence of women at risk of AEP (Project CHOICES Research Group, 2002). Six settings were identified including: primary care, university-hospital based OB/GYN practices, an urban jail, substance abuse treatment programs, and a media-recruited sample. Respondents were 6.9 times more likely to be at risk for AEP (12.5%; 95% CI 5.2-9.3) than in the general population (2%). The prevalence of women at risk ranged from 5% in the primary care health centers to 24% in the substance abuse treatment programs. Project CHOICES Feasibility Study (n=190): Having identified settings with high numbers of women at risk, CDC next funded the CHOICES investigators to develop and test the feasibility and impact of an intervention to prevent AEP in a single arm study (Project CHOICES Intervention Research Group, 2003). The CHOICES intervention consisted of four motivational interviewing-based sessions and an OB/GYN visit. At six months postintervention, 68.2% of the women were at reduced risk of AEP. Project CHOICES Randomized Clinical Trial (n=830): Given the success of the feasibility study, the CHOICES investigators were next funded to test the intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT; Floyd, et al., 2007). In the RCT, 69.1% of the women in the CHOICES intervention reduced risk for an AEP at 9-months and the odds of being at reduced risk for AEP were twofold greater (OR 2.11) in the intervention group than the control group (95% CI 1.47-3.03). CHOICES+: The investigators from the Texas site have recently been funded to conduct the next phase of the Project CHOICES comprehensive prevention program. In CHOICES+, the original Project CHOICES intervention will be adapted to a 2-session intervention and modified to include a smoking intervention and referral to an evidence-based smoking cessation program within the Harris County Hospital District, one of the largest public hospital systems in the US. 74% of the women at risk of AEP in the CHOICES Efficacy Trial were current smokers. Smoking is also a potentially modifiable risk factor that frequently co-occurs with alcohol use and increases the risk of maternal and fetal complications. If successful, CHOICES+ could be disseminated throughout hospitals across the country.

N2  - Although fetal alcohol exposure has been associated with deficits in processing speed, relatively little is known about the neurophysiological response patterns that underlie cognitive performance. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in a large sample of Inuit children (M age = 11.3 yr; range = 9.8-12.9 yr) during a visual Go/No-Go task. The task required a button response press to each individually presented letter except the letter "X," which occurred on 30% of the trials. Stimuli were presented on a computer screen for 500 ms, with an offset of 1100 ms and ~200 ms interstimulus interval. Children were classified as either alcohol-exposed (ALC; n = 31) or controls (n = 76), depending on whether the mother reported any binge drinking during pregnancy when interviewed at the time of the ERP assessment. Both groups were more accurate in executing Go responses than in inhibiting No-go, M = 92 vs. 64%, F(1,105) = 522.1, p <.001. Failures to inhibit to No-go occurred more rapidly than correct Go presses, M = 395 vs. 465 ms, F(1,105) = 173.4, p <.001, suggesting that the pace of the task led to some impulsive errors. There were no differences between groups in accuracy or reaction time (ps >.20). ERP analyses focused primarily on Cz over the central scalp region, which revealed a slower P2 latency in ALC vs. controls, M = 269 vs. 252 ms, F(1,105) = 6.2, p <.05. As expected, P3 peak amplitude was larger to No-go vs. Go in all children, M = 14.8 vs. 6.7 muV, F(1,105) = 107.3, p <.001, but the No-go P3 was significantly reduced in the ALC group when compared with controls, M = 12.9 vs. 16.6 muV, F(1,105) = 5.1, p <.05. The finding of a delayed P2 component is consistent with recent findings on a similar visual Go/No-go task in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, suggesting a deficit in stimulus perception and identification processing that is evident at relatively low thresholds of exposure. In the context of the Go/No-go paradigm, the reduced P3 in the alcohol-exposed group may reflect less synchronous neuronal firing or reduced attentional allocation associated with response inhibition. These ERP effects, which were unaltered after accounting for a comprehensive set of potential confounders, indicate high specificity for alcohol. The absence of performance differences on this relatively challenging task suggests that the children with prenatal alcohol exposure may be achieving successful response inhibition through different neural pathways.

N2  - Purpose: Reductions in hippocampal volume are commonly reported in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs); for example, previous work in our lab has shown loss of left hippocampal volume and disturbed age-related volumetric hippocampal growth relative to typically developing controls (Willoughby et al., JINS, 2008). Given the memory impairments in FASDs and hippocampal vulnerability to prenatal alcohol exposure hippocampal abnormalities may be expected, although some authors have reported no volume differences relative to typically developing controls. However, volumetry measures may not reveal the full scope of prenatal alcohol damage and more subtle hippocampal deficits may exist. Thus, the purpose of this research is to extend study of the hippocampus in FASDs beyond volume measures to other indices of hippocampal shape and composition. We hypothesized that the hippocampi in children with a FASD would show (1) reduced linear width, (2) disturbed microstructural diffusion characteristics, and (3) an abnormal metabolic profile. Methods: 24 children with a FASD and 21 controls, aged 10-14 underwent scanning in a 1.5T GE scanner. Structural, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data were collected. For both the left and right hippocampus two raters masked to group status (1) manually traced volume and width, (2) yielded ROI-based measures of mean diffusivity, axial and radial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy, and (3) measured absolute metabolic concentrations. Results: In FASD relative to controls left hippocampal parameters showed an overall thinning and significantly reduced width in the posterior region (p <.05). Mean, axial, and radial diffusivity were reduced in the medial temporal lobe and multiple metabolic differences were observed, with decreases in inositol, Nacetyl-aspartate, and glutamine-glutamate (all ps <.05). There were fewer differences between typically developing children and children with a FASD on right hippocampal parameters, although middle hippocampal width and creatine were reduced suggesting damage occurred (ps<.05). Conclusions: These findings reveal an array of hippocampal abnormalities in children with a FASD. The left hippocampus in particular showed posterior thinning, decreased diffusivity, and aberrant metabolic profiles.

N2  - Gestational alcohol exposure is associated with structural and functional brain alterations, neuropsychological deficits, and increased risk of developing mental illness, including substance use disorders. Cognitive vulnerabilities have been proposed as one potential mechanism contributing to addiction risk, but little research has compared the cognitive abilities of youth with FASD to other populations at risk for problematic substance use. This study compared neuropsychological performance of youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to peers with conduct disorder and/or a familial history of alcoholism, but without prenatal alcohol exposure. Sixty-nine youth (mean age: 13.6 years) underwent neuropsychological assessment, across four demographically-matched groupings: youth with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (n = 17), youth with a high density of non-maternal familial alcoholism (n = 16), youth with conduct disorder (n = 18), and comparison youth without risk factors (n = 18). Neuropsychological outcomes included measures of working memory, planning, processing speed, and academic achievement. Caregivers also completed a behavior checklist. Between-group comparisons revealed that the FASD group showed poorer performance on the majority of neuropsychological outcomes examined and higher rates of behavior problems, compared to the three other groups, which did not differ from each other. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) of observed differences ranged from medium to large. These data show poorer neuropsychological performance and higher rates of caregiver reported behavior problems in adolescents with FASD, in comparison to youth with risk factors for developing substance use problems. Future studies will examine how cognitive impairments may relate to the development of problematic substance use in individuals with FASD.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) disorders. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, and are unique in their capacity for continuous self-renewal and pluripotential differentiation. When cultured in suspension, without antidifferentiation factors, mouse ES cells differentiate to three-dimensional multicellular aggregates, called embryoid bodies (EBs). A set of transcription factors (Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog) is responsible for maintaining the ES cell state in both humans and mice through activation/repression of target genes. Downregulation of these transcription factors has been shown to occur during cell differentiation. We used the spontaneous, untargeted differentiation of mouse ES cells to EBs as an in vitro model to investigate the effect of ethanol during early embryogenesis. Our previous study using Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates has indicated that ethanol exposure of mouse ES cells during differentiation to EBs interfered with the expression levels of Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog. Here, we used multicolor flow cytometry (FC) for pluripotency marker analysis, simultaneously with measurement of cell viability and apoptosis markers (7-AAD staining and anti-cleaved PARP antibody) to distinguish protein expression levels in live vs. apoptotic/dead cells. Data showed that during differentiation of mES cells to EBs in live cells i) both Sox2 and Nanog protein expression were downregulated, and ii) treatment of ES cells with ethanol for three days accelerated downregulation of Sox2 and Nanog expression. Furthermore, iii) ethanol induced more than two-fold increase in apoptosis during differentiation of ES cells to EBs, as assessed by FC with annexin-V/7-AAD staining. Our findings suggest that ethanol triggers apoptosis and deregulates the pluripotency regulatory network of core transcription factors during early embryogenesis, which may be responsible for abnormalities observed in FAS. This study lays the foundation for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating the differentiated EB state in response to ethanol.

N2  - Cardinal features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) include varying degrees of central nervous system dysfunction and growth retardation. We previously reported that with each bout of maternal alcohol consumption (1.75 g/kg), the mother and fetus exhibit transient acidemia and reductions in maternal and fetal plasma amino acid levels, the availability of which are critical to fetal growth and development. This study tested the hypothesis that supplementation with glutamine, an amino acid that is important in the regulation of acid base homeostasis, would lessen or eliminate the reduction in fetal plasma amino acid levels in response to alcohol (thus potentially having a protective effect). Pregnant ewes at 130 +/- 7 days gestation were assigned to one of three treatment groups: a saline control group, an alcohol group, and an alcohol plus glutamine supplementation group. The alcohol (1.75 mg/kg) or saline infusions were delivered intravenously over an hour. L-Glutamine (30 mg/kg) was administered as a bolus intravenously at the beginning of the experiment. Changes in fetal arterial pH and amino acid levels (measured by HPLC) were measured over one hour (peak BAC occurs at one hour). The alcohol group displayed a significant reduction in plasma levels of multiple amino acids, including glutamine, arginine, citrulline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, histidine, alanine, phenylalanine, ornithine, glycine, and b-alanine at the 60th minute compared to the baseline values. In contrast, the saline control group exhibited no differences and there were mild elevations or no changes in the alcohol plus glutamine group. Thus, we conclude that the fetal growth retardation caused by alcohol induced alterations in fetal amino acids levels may be ameliorated by glutamine supplementation. Supported by NIAAA 10940 (TAC).

N2  - Previous work demonstrated that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) results in brain defects at different stages of development. The current studies were undertaken to characterize the effects of PAE on the levels of several neurotransmitters at early developmental stages. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed at embryonic day 7 (E7) with either a 25% ethanol derived calorie (ALC) or pair-fed (PF) liquid diet. At E13, fetal brains were collected from dams of both the ALC and PF groups. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to evaluate the levels of neurotransmitters in E13 fetal brains. This approach employed here involves the use of a chiral LC column in conjunction with quantitative mass spectrometric multiple reaction monitoring attained utilizing a triple quadrupole MS. Quantitative chiral analyses of catecholamines, idolamine and amino acids neurotransmitters revealed the reduction in the levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin and glutamate as a result of PAE (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the levels of glutamate in fetal brains at E13 between the ALC and PF groups. These findings demonstrate that PAE reduces the levels of catecholamines, idolamine and amino acids neurotransmitters in E13 fetal brains. This study suggests that alterations of selective neurotransmitters may be the cause of abnormalities in brain functions and behaviors in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

N2  - A cardinal feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is growth deficiency and all models of intrauterine growth restriction demonstrate reductions in uterine blood flow. Pregnancy-induced increases in uterine blood flow (~30 fold) is associated with increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, eNOS phosphorylation, and nitric oxide production at the level of maternal uterine artery endothelial cells (UAECs). We hypothesized that ethanol will reduce eNOS expression and its activity via reduced phosphorylation and the signaling pathways that control eNOS activity in UAECs. Endothelial cells from primary uterine arteries of pregnant ewes (gestational day 120-130; term = 147) were isolated and validated using FACS and maintained in culture to passage 4. Maternal binge drinking patterns were mimicked; i.e. UAECs cultured to 70% confluence were treated with 0 (control), 60, 90, 120, or 150 mg/dl of ethanol in a compensating system for 5 h on 2 consecutive days. Cell lysates were analyzed using Western blotting. Cell viability was maintained among groups; uncleaved caspase 3 was unaltered by ethanol and cleaved caspase 3 was not detectable. Compared to control, total eNOS level was reduced to 70%, 70%, 63%, and 43% at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl ethanol respectively. p635eNOS also decreased substantially to 29%, 21%, 18%, and 15% with increasing ethanol concentrations. Caveolin-1, the caveolar scaffolding protein that is predominantly associated with eNOS was unaltered by ethanol treatment. However, investigation of the ERK1/2 pathway, the major signaling cascade that is coupled to eNOS activation in UAECs revealed that total ERK1 was reduced to 87%, 75%, 55%, and 16% and total ERK2 was reduced to 66%, 55%, 35%, and 21% respectively at 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg/dl ethanol. In addition, compared to the control, pERK1 level was reduced to 57%, 32%, 29%, and 24% with increasing ethanol doses. These alterations were specific to ERK1/2 signaling in that pAKT or total AKT were not altered among groups. These data delineate the effects of binge-like ethanol exposure on the abundance and post-translational modification via phosphorylation of eNOS and ERK1/2 enzymes in UAECs. Further, stoichiometrically disproportional levels of eNOS and caveolin-1 may influence eNOS phosphorylation. These results strongly hint that intrauterine environment may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of FASD. Support: NIH HL49210, HD38843 HL89144, AA10940.

N2  - There is increasing evidence that alcohol exposure during the developmental period can leave lasting epigenetic marks consequently perturbing the expression of key genes resulting in physiological and behavioral changes in the offspring of the exposed individual. For example, the expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene in the hypothalamic nuclei of rats exposed to alcohol in utero is significantly diminished as compared to control animals. Long lasting changes in the gene expression of various genes are often caused by alteration in the DNA methylation pattern in the promoter region of the affected gene. In this study we investigated the effect of the prenatal alcohol exposure on the DNA methylation in the hypothalamic POMC promoter by methylation-specific PCR. The rat POMC gene contains a CpG island spanning almost 200 bps in the -59 to -244 region. Nine sets of primers specific for various CpG-rich sites from this region were designed to assess the extent of cytosine methylation in the male offspring of alcohol-fed (AF) mother compared to the pair-fed (PF) and ad libitum-fed (AD) groups. We identified several sites where the cytosine methylation in the AF animals was significantly higher than in the control groups. In particular, in the site spanning the region -81 to -146 the ratio of methylated to unmethylated signals was 6 to 10 times higher in AF animals in comparison to controls. Thus, the POMC promoter hypermethylation in the hypothalami of the AF rats may be a causative factor in the decrease of neuronal POMC gene expression in the affected animals.

N2  - Background: We previously identified a metric of "at-risk" drinking during pregnancy in an urban African-American cohort. The metric included multiple indicators of alcohol consumption and of problem drinking. The metric was validated by demonstrating that it had greater utility than individual measures of alcohol consumption in predicting several neurobehavioral outcomes in preschool children. We hypothesized that our metric of "at-risk" drinking would also improve prediction of birth outcomes. Methods: A measure of "at-risk" prenatal alcohol exposure was constructed using antenatal maternal report of average alcohol per day (AAD) and per drinking day (AADD) at around conception, at the first prenatal visit, and across pregnancy. Scores on the MAST, T-ACE and CAGE screens were also included in computing the "at-risk" metric. Birth size data were used for 224 children from the same cohort and who did not participate in the previous preschool assessment. Ballard maturational score and measures of birth weight, birth length, and head circumference were examined. Data were analyzed using partial correlations between birth data and the "at-risk" metric and the several component measures of prenatal alcohol consumption, controlling for gestational age based on date of last menstrual period. Results: Smaller birth size, including birth-weight and a trend for birth-height, and lower Ballard maturational scores at birth were predicted solely by the metric of "at-risk" alcohol consumption. Conclusion: The current metric of maternal gestational alcohol consumption predicted alcohol-related decreases in birth weight and birth length and gestation age at birth. The results further validated the metric as a more reliable assessment of fetal risk prenatal alcohol exposure than any of the component frequency/quantity measures. Previous research has demonstrated a significant potential for considerable maternal under-reporting and denial of in-pregnancy alcohol consumption. The current or similar metrics may limit under-reporting and be more accurate assessments of exposure, critical to diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) and to research examining neurobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine important predictors of periconceptional risky drinking among pregnant Latinas in New Mexico. Binge drinking patterns during pregnancy, especially in early pregnancy, might lead to development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in the offspring. Pregnant women attending the University of New Mexico prenatal care clinics served as the study population. Consecutively chosen patients who gave consent were recruited into the study. For purposes of this analysis, the sample size was restricted to 155 Latina women. Women were interviewed by a bilingual trained interviewer about any episodes of binge drinking (> 4 drinks/occasion) a month around their last menstrual period (LMP) and were administered a TWEAK screening questionnaire. Socio-demographic (age, education, insurance, place of birth, marital status), lifestyle (smoking), and reproductive health (gravidity, parity, pregnancy planning, history of adverse perinatal outcomes) characteristics were ascertained. The expected date of delivery and gestational age were based on LMP and fetal ultrasound. Predictors of binge drinking were identified by Chi-square tests and logistic regression in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. A backward selection procedure was used to identify those covariates that were independently associated with binge drinking in the final multivariable model. In this sample, 17.4% of Latinas admitted at least one binge drinking episode a month around their LMP. Results of multivariate analysis indicate that Latinas born in the U.S. have much greater risk of binge drinking in periconceptional period (OR=3.2; 95% CI: 1.2; 8.9) compared to foreign-born Latinas. Similarly, Latinas who primarily speak English at home were at much greater risk (OR=3.6; 95% CI: 1.3; 10.5) compared with predominately Spanish-speaking women. No other variables were identified as significant predictors in multivariable models. Even though Latinas are often considered to be at lower risk of alcohol abuse, recent reports indicate that the pre valence of alcohol consumption in this group might be increasing due to changing cultural norms. Our results indicate that higher-acculturated Latinas are at much greater risk of binge drinking before conception and in early pregnancy compared with less-acculturated Latinas. Culturally sensitive interventions should be developed to address risky alcohol consumption among Latinas of reproductive age.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts behavioral development, leading to long-lasting alterations in a number of domains, including cognitive performance. Using a rodent model, we have previously shown that choline supplementation can attenuate adverse effects of developmental alcohol exposure, even when administered weeks later, during postnatal development. The present study examined whether administration of choline at different postnatal ages following ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent neonatal brain growth spurt, can reduce alcohol-related memory impairments. Neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of seven treatment groups. Five groups received ethanol intubations in a binge-like manner from postnatal day (PD) 4-9 at a dose of 5.25 g/kg/day; two groups served as sham intubated controls. All rats were injected s.c. from PD 11-40 with either 100 mg/kg/day choline chloride or saline. One ethanol-exposed group was injected with saline from PD 11-40; the others received choline injections from PD 11-20, PD 21-30, PD 31-40, or PD 11-40. The two sham groups received either choline or saline throughout the PD 11-40 period. At three months of age, subjects were tested on an object recognition task, a simple and sensitive task used to assess long-term memory. On day 1 of the task, all rats spent a substantially higher amount of time exploring an unfamiliar square wood bead than familiar circular wood beads. On day 2, a significant preference for a second novel object, a wooden spindle over the square was observed in all groups, except the ethanol-exposed group not treated with choline. That is, administration of choline supplementation at any of the time points significantly improved object recognition performance among alcohol-exposed, with the greatest improvement among those that received choline from PD 11-40. These findings suggest that choline administration at various postnatal periods can attenuate ethanol's effects on simple memory performance. These results have important implications for the intervention of alcohol's adverse effects on development, indicating that choline may serve as an effective treatment for individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, even when administered later in postnatal life.

N2  - Prevention of alcohol use is difficult, thus therapies that ameliorate alcohol's damage are desirable. The severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) increases with parity, implying the depletion of a protective maternal factor. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in women and causes neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring that parallel FASD. We hypothesized that moderate maternal iron inadequacy (ID) exacerbates alcohol's effects upon the developing brain and tested this in rat pups reared by dams fed iron-sufficient (IS) or ID diets. We exposed pups to 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg alcohol during the brain growth spurt period via gastric gavage (postnatal days 4-9; P4-9). Blood alcohol levels were not altered by iron status and peaks were ~275 or ~420 mg/dl for the 3.5 and 5 g/kg alcohol doses, respectively. Dams of the ID pups had depleted iron stores without anemia, a condition common in American women. At P10, ID pups fed 0, 3.5 or 5 g/kg alcohol (ID-0, ID-3.5, ID-5) were smaller and anemic as indicated by decreased hemoglobin. At ~P32 we evaluated the pups' associative learning skills using delay eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC), a cerebellum-dependent task. The frequency and amplitude of conditioned responses (CR) in the ID-0, IS-0, IS-3.5, and IS-5 groups did not differ reflecting the test's simplicity. In contrast, ID-5 pups had a dramatically reduced CR frequency and strength; values were ~63% and 38%, respectively, of control values. ID-3.5 pups had a non-significant trend toward impaired learning. A main effect for alcohol dose and significant iron status x alcohol dose interaction were seen for CR frequency, F[2, 47]=6.44, p < 0.005, and CR amplitude, F[2, 47]=3.23, p < 0.05. Proliferative and apoptotic responses in the P10 cerebellar cortex were evaluated with cleaved caspase-3 and phosphohistone H3 immunostaining. Preliminary results indicate that ID-5 pups have increased cerebellar proliferation and apoptosis when compared to IS-5 pups. Additional behavioral assessments, including trace ECC, are underway to evaluate the extent of the neurodevelopmental damage caused by alcohol and developmental ID. This is the first study to show that maternal iron inadequacy profoundly exacerbates alcohol's effects upon learning in the offspring. We propose that maternal iron status is an important modulator of fetal neurobehavioral outcome following alcohol exposure. (Funded by NIH award T32 ES07015, R32 AA11085 and Palmer fund).

N2  - Introduction: Identifying neurochemical effects specific to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can help define neurobehavioral profiles in the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs). In vivo phosphorus (31P) MR spectroscopy profiles neurochemical development after PAE by measuring components of metabolic pathways of membrane phospholipids (MPLs), including precursors (e.g., phosphoethanolamine [PE] and phosphocholine [PC]) and breakdown products (e.g., glycerophosphoethanolamine [GPE] and and glycerophosphocholine [GPC]). MPL precursor levels are sensitive to early neurodevelopmental changes in cortex. We hypothesized that PAE would alter MPL metabolism, reflecting frontocortical developmental delay. Methods: Participants were 20 African American children - 11 PAE (6 boys, 6.0-7.6 yrs old) and 9 non-PAE (3 boys, 6.0-8.0 yrs old) - from a larger study of interactionsof gestational nutrition and prenatal alcohol. A 3-D whole-brain, multi-voxel 31P spectroscopy measure was done at 4 Tesla. Cortical regions of interest included dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC), orbitofrontal (OFC), ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC), anterior cingulate (ACC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Group differences in levels of PE, PC, GPE, and GPC were tested using the generalized estimating equation method with group, gender, and side (right vs. left) as factors. Results: PE levels were significantly higher bilaterally in the ACC, IFG and vmPFC of PAE children compared to non-PAE children. GPE levels were significantly higher in DLPFC and GPC levels were higher in the OFC in PAE children compared to non-PAE children. Conclusion: In healthy development, PE levels are higher at birth then decrease with age, reflecting high early MPL synthesis critical for neocortical development. In contrast, levels of MPL breakdown products (GPE and GPC) are low early in life and later increase, reflecting greater MPL turnover in older children. The current preliminary results showing higher PE levels and greater breakdown activity of MPLs in several prefrontal areas suggest a possible PAE-related delay in the maturation of cortical development. The implications of possible deviations in developmental trajectories of MPL metabolism and relations to neurobehavioral outcome remain to be determined.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have altered performance in learning and memory tasks and have altered physiological function, including hyperesponsiveness to stressors. In our rat model, parallel changes are observed. The hippocampus is a key modulator of stress, is involved in learning and memory, and is a site for adult neurogenesis. Previously, we found that PAE alters stressinduced suppression in neurogenesis in male rats. Here we investigated patterns of adult hippocampal neurogenesis under basal and stress conditions in PAE female rats. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley females were assigned to 1 of 3 prenatal treatments on day 1 of pregnancy: 1) Alcohol (ethanol, E) - liquid diet containing 36% ethanol-derived calories; 2) Pair-fed (PF) - isocaloric liquid diet with maltosedextrin substituted for ethanol, g/kg body wt/day of gestation; and 3) Control (C) - lab chow ad libitum. In adulthood, female offspring were assigned to either non-stress (undisturbed throughout) or stress (9 days of repeated restraint stress, 1 hr/day) conditions. On day 10, all rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine and perfused either 24hr (cell proliferation) or 3wk (cell survival) later. There was a stressinduced increase in cell proliferation in C (p=.058), but not E or PF females. While there was no effect of stress on cell survival in C and E females, PF females exhibited a stress-induced decrease, which may be due to elevated levels of cell survival under basal conditions (PF>C,E, p <.05). Cell survival was further assessed using NeuN (neuron specific marker) and GFAP (glial cell marker). E females produced fewer new neurons than C and PF females under both basal and stress conditions (p < 05). Intriguingly, E females also had reduced glial cells compared to C and PF animals under both basal and stress conditions (p <.05). These results indicate that alterations in adult neurogenesis occur under both basal and stress conditions in E females. PAE appears to alter the neurogenic stress response differentially in males and females, suggesting a mediating role for the gonadal hormones. It is possible that alterations in neurogenesis following PAE and stress may contribute to learning and memory deficits seen in individuals with FASD. Specific PF effects could be due to the stress/diet restriction that accompanies pair-feeding.

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to establish the clinical value of meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) analysis as a universal screening tool intended for the identification of infants at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). This will be accomplished by assessing the level of voluntary participation in a prenatal alcohol exposure screening program with informed consent, and by determining the logistics and feasibility of implementing meconium testing, the necessary follow-up, and intervention programs, as part of routine care. In addition, this study will determine whether FAEE-positive meconium correlate with standard childhood developmental milestones and Bayley's test for neurodevelopmental screening. Methods: Over the course of 5 years, informed consent will be sought from all women from the region of Grey Bruce, Ontario delivering at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario. Meconium samples will be collected and tested for the presence of FAEE by solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Children who test positive for meconium FAEE will be matched to children who test negative and followed-up for 2 years through an existing Public Health program in the area involving frequent home visits and assessments of developmental milestones by a Public Health nurse. Matched controls will be followed-up by study personnel via regular phone interviews to assess developmental milestones. If a developmental delay is suspected, the child will undergo neurodevelopmental testing with a trained professional, and will be referred to various intervention programs in the area tailored to the child's needs. Furthermore, support services for the mother will be available if needed. This study has been approved by research ethics boards of the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Western Ontario. Results: Enrollment and sample collection has begun in November, 2008. The first positive case has been identified, and the planned follow-up set up with the Public Health department. Discussion: This study will reveal the population's willingness to partake in a neonatal screening program for prenatal ethanol exposure, assess its utility as a standard tool in clinical practice, and enable us to propose a model for service delivery. Furthermore, this study will determine the predictive value of FAEE-positive meconium with regards to neurodevelopment delays frequently observed in FASD-affected individuals.

N2  - Most children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy can not be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We are investigating whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene and protein expression at term may provide a reliable and sensitive diagnostic indicator of maternal drinking during pregnancy as well as a prognostic indicator of the risk of functional brain damage predictive of adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in affected offspring. We previously reported that moderate drinking during pregnancy alters the expression of about two dozen genes coding for proteins associated with nervous, endocrine and immune system development. In the current study, we initiated a combination of two-dimensional PAGE analyses coupled with mass spectroscopy to identify placental proteins altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were assigned to one of two experimental groups. One group consumed a 5% ethanol solution (in 0.066% saccharin water) four hours a day throughout gestation, resulting in a mean maternal peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. A control group consumed a matched volume of saccharin water four hours each day. At term (gestational day 20) placentas were harvested, saline-perfused to remove blood from the tissue, and processed for analysis of protein expression. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis revealed a large number of proteins whose expression is diminished by maternal drinking during pregnancy. To date, preliminary mass spectroscopic analysis of isolated spots has identified eighteen proteins altered by maternal drinking. These proteins are associated with processes in cell differentiation and development, morphogenesis of anatomical structures and regulation of apoptosis. The preliminary results suggest that a sufficiently large enough number of placental proteins are altered by moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD.

N2  - Introduction: Craniofacial dysmorphology is an important but poorly understood diagnostic feature of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). To further understand the developmental consequences of alcohol exposure, this study was designed with two objectives: (1) Identify the effect of alcohol exposure on underlying cranial facial bone growth in a mouse model; and (2) Examine the relationship between bone and facial dysmorphology and compare mouse and human morphometries. Methods: Four treatments of C57BL/6J dams (The Jackson Laboratory), CHOW, ALC-PF (pre-pregnancy alcohol exposure and at-pregnancy isocaloric pair-fed), PF-PF (pre- and at-pregnancy pair-fed), and ALC-ALC (pre- and at-pregnancy alcohol exposure) were studied. The pre-pregnancy treatment lasted 7 days prior to mating and the pregnancy treatment between gestational day 7 (E7) and E16, using a 4.8% (v/v) alcohol exposure in a liquid diet. In-vivo three dimensional microCT imagings were performed at p7. Fifteen metric distances were measured on the skulls, which matched to the human studies by Moore et al. (2007). Stepwise discriminant analysis was performed examining the ability of anthropomorphic measures to classify alcohol exposed mice. Results: Measurements of width (minimal frontal and bigonial) correctly classified 90% of the ALC-ALC mice Vs 91 % of the CHOW mice. Results comparing ALC-ALC to ALC-PF used inner canthai and mid face differences and correctly classified 76% and 83% respectively. These results are similar to those based on microvedio facial analysis in mouse (see Anthony et al adjacent poster). Conclusion: These results are similar to those reported in human studies (Moore et al., 2007) in which width and depth measurements successfully classified FAS individuals from controls. This indicates a similar effect of alcohol exposure on dysmorphology across species. Further studies will help delineate effects of quantity and frequency of prenatal alcohol exposure on facial dysmorphology to enable diagnosis of FASD.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), including a wide spectrum of developmental deficits in face and brain. Presence of a set of abnormal facial features (including a smooth Philtrum, short Palpebral fissures, and thin Upper Vermillion) is required for diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, many children with prenatal alcohol exposure sufficient to induce facial deficits do not show cardinal features of facial dysmorphology and diagnosis is not feasible. This study aims to delineate the effect of alcohol on the spectrum of dysmorphic facial features, using mice, C57BL/B6J (B6J, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Ma), and C57BL/6N (B6N, Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN), with common ancestry, separated by > 150 generations. The alcohol treatment consists of 4.8% alcohol liquid diet for 7 days pre-pregnancy, and gestational days 7(E7)to E16. The diet volume, blood alcohol levels, and 14 anthropometric facial measurements for E17 embryos were analyzed. Measurements were used in discriminant analysis to obtain positive predictability of alcohol exposure. We found that B6N demonstrated higher alcohol intake and blood alcohol concentrations than B6J, and embryonic weights are reduced in both lines. Alcohol altered upper and mid facial depths; nasal, nasal bridge and palpebral fissure lengths; and outer canthal width in both B6N and B6J, with B6N having additional facial width changes. Discriminant analysis of facial measurements to classify alcohol exposure for Alc to Chow control demonstrated B6N and B6J required minimal frontal width, with B6N requiring added width features, apposed to B6J requiring width and depth features. (Predictability: B6N, 90%; B6J, 87%). Analysis of Alc to Pair-Fed groups suggested B6N required width classifications with mid facial depth, and B6J required facial depth and height (predictability: B6N, 92%; B6J, 85%). Our data indicates that B6N and B6J mice show dysmorphic facial features, comparable to human facial differences by ethnicity (Moore et al., 2007). Current data shows differences in the severity of facial dysmorphology in mice with common ancestry, possibly attributed to genetic drift.

N2  - Purpose: Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine trends in current alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant and nonpregnant women of childbearing age between 2001 and 2005 and to examine the prevalence among sociodemographic subgroups based on age, race/ethnicity, education, employment status and marital status. Methods: Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collected from 2001 through 2005 among 14,139 pregnant and 324,668 nonpregnant women aged 18-44 were analyzed. Annual prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking (5 or more drinks on an occasion) in the past 30 days were calculated for pregnant and nonpregnant women. Statistical significance of the relationship between prevalence estimates and time was estimated using chi-square tests. Prevalence estimates among subgroups were also estimated and logistic regression was used to determine the association between alcohol use and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: The findings indicate that while no statistically significant change occurred between 2001 and 2005 among pregnant women, a slight decline occurred in the prevalence of any alcohol use (54.6% to 52.2%; p<.001) and binge drinking (12.3% to 11.5%; p<.001) among nonpregnant women of childbearing age. Among pregnant women, the estimated prevalence of any alcohol use was higher among women aged 35-44 years (17.7%) than women aged 18-24 years (8.6%), college educated women (14.4%) than women with a high school education or less (8.5%), employed women (13.6%) than unemployed women (8.2%), and unmarried women (13.3%) than married women (10.2%). Conclusion: The relatively stable prevalence estimates of any alcohol use and binge drinking demonstrate that alcohol use among women of childbearing age continues to be a public health concern. The higher prevalence of alcohol use among some sociodemographic subgroups such as higher educated, employed, or unmarried women suggests the need for targeted public health prevention activities.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol results in a range of adverse cognitive-behavioral and morphological outcomes, collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Children with FASD consistently exhibit delayed motor development and deficits in sensory-motor skills, suggesting that the measurement of these skills could be a powerful tool for assessing brain dysfunction in this population. There is a significant overlap between the brain structures affected by the teratogenic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and those that are responsible for the performance of sensory-motor tasks. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the robot exoskeleton known as the Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movements (KINARM) could serve as an objective tool for assessing sensory-motor deficits in children with FASD. Male and female children (9 to 15 years of age) were required to complete two tasks that assess sensory-motor control. Task 1: Visually-guided reaching movements examined the ability of subjects to generate goal-directed motor movements with each limb. The data acquisition system extracted over 20 features of visual-guided reaching including reaction time, movement time, joint motion, torque and power, relative joint power, path length, and movement variability. Task 2: Limb matching task required that the subject perform a bilateral limb matching task without vision: the robot moved one limb to a spatial location and the subject was asked to match this limb geometry with the other limb in the absence of visual cues. The resultant errors (the error in matching the spatial position of one arm with the other arm) were measured. In comparison to controls, children with FASD showed slower reaction times with both hands. Movement time was significantly slower in children with FASD only with the right hand. Moreover, children with FASD exhibited greater distance and direction errors with the right, but not the left, hand. Similarly, children with FASD displayed greater error in matching the spatial position of the right, but not the left, hand. The results of this study suggest that the KINARM is a promising research and diagnostic tool that could be used to assess motor control deficits in children resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - We have completed the first year of a 3-year study evaluating the effects of a strength-based, motor skill development program for children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Our hypothesis is that improvements in the motor domain will extend to other domains, and specifically affect behaviour and adaptive functioning. Moreover, prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, and this may underlie some of the behavioural and adaptive problems in individuals with FASD. Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol exhibit increased basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond infancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the motor skill program on the HPA system (as indicated by salivary cortisol levels) and to compare cortisol levels of children with FASD to that of control children. Ten children (age 7-13 y) participated in an 8-week after-school motor skill development program consisting of 2 x 1.5 hour sessions/week. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 5 of these children (with confirmed diagnosis, FASD group) and compared at 3 time points: before, immediately after, and 2 months after completion of the program. In addition, cortisol levels were compared at each time point to 15 control children (C group, no FASD, similar age and gender to FASD group) to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: wake-up, after school, and just before bedtime. Salivary cortisol levels showed significant (p's < 0.05) diurnal variation in all children. Cortisol levels were elevated at wake-up, compared with after school and bedtime (p's < 0.001), but were not different between after school and bedtime. Cortisol levels did not vary significantly over the time points (before, immediately and 2 months after the program) in the C or FASD groups, indicating that there was no effect of the motor skill program on cortisol levels. When the time points were combined, there was a trend (p=0.059) for cortisol levels to be higher at wake-up in children with FASD, compared with control children. These preliminary results indicate that cortisol levels may be elevated at wake-up in children with FASD, and suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure has long-term effects on HPA dysregulation in humans.

N2  - Purpose: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are among the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Identification of nutritional factors that may confer risk or provide protection is critical as these factors are potentially modifiable. Although nutritional status for various micronutrients is known to be affected by chronic alcohol consumption in non-pregnant adults, nutritional status in pregnant women who drink moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol has not been well characterized. We hypothesize that nutritional inadequacies increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with alcohol consumption. Methods: As part of an international collaborative study on FASD, we screened pregnant women in Ukraine and prospectively recruited those who reported moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in early pregnancy and those who reported no or low amounts of alcohol as a comparison group. A blood sample was collected at the time of enrollment (17-18 wks gestation on average) and analyzed for vitamin, mineral and oxidative stress status. Results: We have completed analysis of blood samples for 35 alcohol-exposed women, and 31 comparison pregnant women. Significantly or marginally significantly lower plasma zinc (Zn; p=0.051) and plasma copper (Cu; p=0.019) levels were noted in the alcohol-exposed group relative to unexposed women. We also noted significantly lower ceruloplasmin (Cp) activity (p= 0.036) and TRAP (Total Antioxidant Capacity of Plasma; p=0.006) in the alcohol-exposed group vs. unexposed. Plasma Zn was negatively correlated with TBARs, a lipid peroxidation index, and Cp was positively correlated with TRAP. Conclusion: The compromised Zn and Cu status observed in alcohol-exposed women is consistent with predictions that susceptibility to alcohol-related fetal effects may be influenced by maternal micronutrient deficiencies. Alcohol toxicity is thought to be due in part to oxidative damage; our initial data also show increased oxidative stress with alcohol exposure. Thus, mid-gestation levels of key measures of oxidative stress or antioxidant reserves could be important risk modifiers for alcohol-related adverse pregnancy outcomes. As sample size requirements are met, this continuing study will evaluate the influence of baseline status on these and other nutritional measures on risk for characteristic physical features of FASD, growth, and neurodevelopment in the offspring.

N2  - Purpose: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is among the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Identification of the risks associated with specific dose and gestational timing of alcohol exposure for the characteristic physical features of FASD is needed to aid in diagnosis, particularly in the newborn period, and to provide accurate counseling to pregnant women. Methods: In 2005-6, we screened pregnant women in two regions in Ukraine and prospectively recruited 84 women who reported moderate to heavy alcohol consumption and 82 women who reported little to no alcohol drinking. Women were interviewed at enrollment regarding alcohol exposure in the month around conception and in the previous two-week period using a time-line follow-back method. Following delivery, specially trained geneticists in Ukraine performed blinded physical examinations of infants using a standard checklist of physical features of FASD. Infants who had the cardinal features of FAS including growth deficiency and facial features were classified as "FAS", infants who had some features but final diagnosis required assessment of neurobehavioral performance were classified as "Deferred", and infants with no features were classified as "No FAS". Level of alcohol consumption was compared across the three groups using ANOVA and ANCOVA in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Results: A total of 141 infants were examined by study geneticists. Five infants (3.5%) met criteria for "FAS", 45 infants (31.9%) were "Deferred", and 91 infants (64.5%) were classified as "No FAS". Average daily consumption of absolute ounces of alcohol in both the periconceptional (p=0.002) and the previous two weeks (p < 0.001) was correlated with physical features of FASD after adjustment for maternal tobacco and vitamin use. Average consumption of absolute ounces of alcohol per drinking day in both time periods was also significantly associated with features of FAS (p=0.015 and p < 0.001, respectively). Infants who were classified as "FAS", "Deferred", and "No FAS" were exposed to adjusted means of ~3 drinks, ~2 drinks, and ~1.5 drinks per drinking day in the periconceptional period; slightly lower levels were reported in the most recent two weeks. Conclusion: There is a strong dose-response relation between number of physical features of FASD and quantity of alcohol consumed in early pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: The spectrum of facial and neurobehavioral abnormalities observed among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure makes identification of these individuals difficult. The objective of this study was to explore if a combination of information from anthropometric measures obtained directly and from 3D images and neurobehavioral variables could be used to accurately identify exposed subjects. Methods: As part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), 3D facial images and data from a broad neurobehavioral protocol were collected from 52 children and adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure and 39 non-exposed controls from Helsinki, Finland (35 exposed, 30 non-exposed) and San Diego, CA (17 exposed, 9 non-exposed). Of the exposed subjects, 37 were diagnosed with FAS using the dysmorphological examination procedures of the CIFASD dysmorphology core. For each subject 16 indirect facial measurements, head circumference (direct measurement), and a subset of 29 neurobehavioral variables which had previously been identified as having high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating children with FASD from controls were analyzed. Stepwise discriminant analysis was performed and the percent correct classifications are reported. Performance of the discriminant function was assessed by cross-validation. Results: The most parsimonious model included 4 craniofacial measurements (outer canthal length, nasal length, nasal bridge length, head circumference) and 4 neurobehavioral elements (Delis Kaplan Executive Functioning System: verbal fluency switching, trail making visual scanning; Progressive Planning test: average total time; CANTAB: spatial span total responses). These 8 variables correctly classified 92% of the prenatally exposed and 92% of the non-exposed. There was not a significant difference in classification rates between the samples by site. Thirteen of the 15 subjects, who were prenatally alcohol exposed, but not diagnosed as FAS, were correctly classified as alcohol-exposed. Conclusion: These preliminary results demonstrate that the combination of facial measurements and neurobehavioral test results can reliably identify both previously diagnosed FAS indvidiuals as well as undiagnosed prenatally alcohol exposed individuals. Further studies will focus on other ethnic groups and a broader series of neurobehavioral measures.

N2  - Adaptive function may be especially sensitive to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Previous reports have demonstrated that in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), social skills are negatively associated with age, suggesting deficits in meeting the increasing demands in social functioning. However, this relationship between adaptive function and age in alcohol-exposed children has not been reported in other adaptive domains. We investigated the relation between adaptive function and age in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC) and typically developing controls (CON). Additionally, because a current aim of research in FASDs is to identify a distinctive neurobehavioral profile, a clinical contrast group of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was included to determine if observed patterns of adaptive deficits are specific to alcohol exposure. Sixty-five children (ALC=22, ADHD=23, CON=20) were selected from a larger ongoing study of the behavioral teratogenicity of alcohol. ALC and CON subjects were selected to match the ADHD subjects on age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity. Caregivers were administered the VABS, a semi-structured interview, and were asked to rate their child's behavior on three domains of adaptive function (daily living skills, socialization, communication). Data were analyzed using regression techniques. On all three domains, children in both the ALC and ADHD groups showed deficits in adaptive behavior relative to controls. In addition, children in the ALC group were significantly more impaired than the ADHD group on the daily living skills domain. Within the ALC group, socialization and communication standard scores decreased with increasing age. No relations with age were noted in the ADHD or CON groups. This study adds to the growing body of literature aimed at identifying distinct neurobehavioral profiles of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol and suggests that age may be an important factor for characterizing the differential patterns of deficits seen in children with FASDs. Continued research focused on elucidating the patterns of strengths and weaknesses that exist in alcohol-exposed children ultimately will lead to improved differential diagnosis and effective interventions.

N2  - The main aim of the current research was to investigate strategy application by children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in a multitasking situation. Researchers have obtained evidence that patients with frontal lobe damage and children with ADHD display notable difficulty in multitasking and that this difficulty is associated with their behavioral problems in their daily lives. Given that children with FASD have been shown to have deficits in executive functions, we hypothesized that alcohol-exposed children would show greater difficulty with multitasking than controls and that this difficulty would be associated with parent reported behavior problems. Forty children (20 FASD and 20 typically developing), ages 9 through 17, participated. The two groups were matched with respect to age, sex, and SES. The Six-Part Test (Wilson et al., 1996) was administered to assess multitasking ability as part of a larger test battery that included other tests assessing executive functioning (cognitive planning). In the Six-Part Test, the participants were required to complete, within 5 minutes, three types of tasks, each containing two parts, following specific rules. The Progressive Planning Test was utilized to assess cognitive planning ability. Two parent-rated questionnaires - Dysexecutive Questionnaire for Children (DEX-C) and Social Responsiveness Questionnaire-were employed to obtain information on children's behavior. Contrary to expectation, the groups did not differ on the Six-Part Test, but did differ on the PPT. Furthermore, PPT scores, but not Six-Part Test scores, were associated with parent-rated behavior problems. There is some evidence that the posterior cingulate may be critically involved in multitasking and the dorsolateral frontal cortex, in cognitive planning. Therefore, higher-order cognitive deficits rather than a disinhibitory disorder, like ADHD, seem to underlie behavioral problems in children with FASD.

N2  - Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is a Pavlovian paradigm that involves contingent temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (e.g., pure tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., air puff) that elicits a reflexive blink. In short delay conditioning, a 650-ms delay between the onset of the 750-ms tone and the air puff is presented during the final 100 ms of the tone. EBC was examined in 62 Cape Coloured school-age children in Cape Town, South Africa. Mothers provided pregnancy drinking histories, and dysmorphologists examined the children. 6 children met criteria for full FAS, 3 for PFAS, 25 were heavily exposed nondysmorphic, and 28 were non-exposed controls. Among the 34 children born to heavy drinking mothers, 17.6% met criteria for full FAS, a proportion comparable to that seen in our earlier cohort study. Delay EBC was administered to 62 children at 11.3 yr to assess whether the fetal alcohol-related deficit we reported at 5 yr was seen in a second sample of children at an older age. Two sessions consisting of 50 trials each were administered on the same day. 32 of these children were also administered trace EBC at 12.8 yr. This conditioning procedure is the same as delay except that a 500-ms stimulus-free interval occurs between the offset of the tone and the onset of the air puff. Prenatally exposed children were less likely to meet criterion for delay conditioning than controls, v2 (2) = 8.82, p <.005. Only 33.3% with FAS/PFAS and 44.0% of other heavily exposed met criterion, compared with 78.6% of controls. These data indicate that the EBC impairment seen at 5 yr is also evident in older children. As with delay, the more difficult trace conditioning was also highly sensitive to fetal alcohol exposure. Only 12.5% of the FAS/PFAS and 25% of the heavy exposed met criterion for trace conditioning, compared with 66.7% of the controls. The magnitude of the effect of diagnostic group on trace conditioning was virtually identical to the effect on delay (Cramer's V = .48 vs. .47), suggesting that the impact of fetal alcohol on trace is no greaster than on delay. Recent studies with rats also indicate that delay and trace are equally sensitive to developmental alcohol exposure. These data suggest that alcohol-related impairment in the cerebellar circuitry required for both forms of conditioning is sufficient to account for the alcohol-related deficit in both tasks, although targeting of other brain structures by alcohol cannot be ruled out at this point.

N2  - A sample of 8-11 year old children in Cape Town South Africa, were assessed on the Stewart Extended Continuous Performance Test (E-CPT), which assesses both vigilance and response inhibition. Approximately half of the children were heavily exposed to alcohol in utero; the others were born to women who abstained or drank no more than minimally during pregnancy. In the E-CPT single-digit numbers are displayed sequentially on the screen. The child is instructed to press a button whenever the target number ("9") appears. Trials in which the target appears relatively rarely (e.g., 10% or 30% of the time) assess vigilance; those in which the target appears very frequently (e.g., 70% or 90%) assess response inhibition. In one-third of the trials, the numbers are degraded, making the task more challenging from a perceptual point of view. The fetal alcohol exposed children performed more poorly on the degraded trials, showing poorer vigilance on the 10%, 30%, and 50% trials and poorer response inhibition on the 90% trials. By contrast, the children who were suspect for ADHD based on teacher reports using the Disrupted Behavior Disorders assessment exhibited poorer vigilance and response inhibition on the undegraded trials. The findings that the children who were suspect for ADHD performed more poorly on both the vigilance and response inhibition on the undegraded trials suggests greater sensitivity to deficits in both aspects of attention. By contrast, the children with fetal alcohol exposure showed generally less sensitivity to deficits in both aspects of attention in that their performance was impaired only on the more challenging trials involving the degraded stimuli.

N2  - Academic difficulty has been noted as a secondary disability in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). However, it is unclear if observed school difficulties are disproportionate to the diminished general intellectual function documented in this population. Learning disorders are defined as a significant discrepancy between ability (measured as IQ) and academic achievement. This study conducted two sets of analyses to determine if children with FASDs had increased occurrence of learning disorders in verbal and nonverbal domains. For this study, learning disorder of written expression (verbal domain) was defined as a clinically significant (>1 population standard deviation) difference between verbal (VIQ) and verbal achievement (WRAT-3 Spelling); mathematics learning disorder (nonverbal domain) was similarly defined as a clinically significant difference between nonverbal ability (PIQ) and mathematic achievement (WRAT-3 Arithmetic). In the first analysis, 110 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were compared to 126 non-exposed controls matched on race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status. In the second analysis, 55 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were compared to 55 controls well matched on FSIQ (within 5 points), as well as race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status. In the larger sample, children with FASDs were more likely to have a clinically significant difference between PIQ and WRAT-3 Arithmetic and controls were more likely to have a significant difference between VIQ and WRAT-3 Spelling. However, in the smaller matched sample when IQ was well controlled, a higher occurrence of mathematics learning disorder was observed in children with FASDs but no difference in occurrence of learning disorder of written expression was observed between the groups. These results suggest that children with FASDs may have particular difficulty with nonverbal (arithmetic) academic tasks, while verbal academic ability may be more consistent with overall ability. Nonverbal learning disabilities have been associated with white matter changes in the brain, which also occur following heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Further assessment should be conducted to determine if children with FASDs have additional deficits (e.g. visuospatial) consistent with nonverbal learning disability and whether these neuropsychological deficits relate to changes in white matter.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can alter physical, neurological, and behavioral development, resulting in a range of effects referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The outcome among children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy varies widely and some of this variation may be due to nutritional factors. For example, higher rates of FASD are observed in areas where malnutrition is prevalent. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that many women throughout the world may not consume adequate levels of choline, a nutrient that is critical for brain development, during pregnancy. In this study we examined whether choline deficiency might increase the severity of fetal alcohol effects. Sprague-Dawley female rats were randomly assigned to receive diets containing 40, 70 or 100 percent recommended choline levels from two weeks prior to pregnancy through weaning at postnatal day 21. A group from each diet condition was exposed to alcohol (6.0 g/kg/day) from gestational day 5 to 20 via intragastric intubations. Pair-fed and ad lib lab chow control groups were also included. The offspring were examined for physical development and tested on a range of behavioral tasks. Neither prenatal alcohol exposure nor choline deficient diets by themselves produced robust alterations in development. However, subjects exposed to alcohol prenatally and fed a 40% choline-deficient diet exhibited significant delays in eye opening, impaired hind-limb coordination, and hyperactivity. Outcome measures of subjects exposed to alcohol and fed a 70% choline diet was not significantly different from that of alcohol-exposed subjects fed a 100% recommended choline diet. These data indicate that even moderate suboptimal nutritional status may exacerbate some of ethanol's teratogenic effects, a finding with important implications for the prevention of FASD.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can damage the developing CNS, leading to hyperactivity, motor incoordination, and deficits in cognitive functioning. Prenatal exposure to binge-like ethanol, which is characterized by withdrawal periods, is more damaging than continuous exposure. We have hypothesized that NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity occurs during these withdrawal periods, contributing to ethanol-related neuropathology and behavioral deficits. Consistent with this hypothesis, blocking NMDA receptors during withdrawal with MK-801, a potent NMDA receptor antagonist, reduces the severity of alcohol-related neuropathology in the developing rat. However, when administered at the same time as ethanol, MK-801 exacerbates ethanol's teratogenic effects. The present study examined the effects of administering eliprodil, an NMDAR antagonist that acts on the polyamine modulator site, at various times following an ethanol binge. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of seven treatment groups: five alcohol-exposed (AE) (6 g/kg via intubation on postnatal day (PD) 6) and two sham intubation control (IC) groups. Four AE groups were injected with 5 mg/kg eliprodil at 0, 9, 21, or 33 hrs post-ethanol; the fifth AE group was injected with vehicle 21 hrs postethanol. Each IC group was injected with either eliprodil or vehicle, 21 hrs post-ethanol. Subjects were tested for open field activity (PD18-21) and parallel bar motor coordination (PD30-32). Ethanol exposure produced hyperactivity and motor incoordination. Eliprodil administration at 21 hrs post-ethanol, during ethanol withdrawal, significantly ameliorated ethanol-induced hyperactivity, but was not effective at any other time point. Administering eliprodil did not ameliorate ethanol-induced motor incoordination, indicating that its beneficial effects are task-specific. These data provide further evidence that NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity occurs during periods of withdrawal following developmental alcohol exposure. Furthermore, eliprodil did not exacerbate ethanol's effects when administered at 0 or 9 hrs post-ethanol, therefore unlike MK-801, eliprodil is not toxic when administered during alcohol intoxication. These findings indicate that administration of NMDAR antagonists that act at the polyamine modulatory site, may serve as relatively safe and effective interventions for some fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy produces fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and studies suggest that alterations in the expression brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are involved in its etiology. However, little is known about the role of changes in BDNF function on FASD pathophysiology. Recent studies indicate that BDNF-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity play a role in the development of inhibitory synaptic connections. Activitydependent release of BDNF from CA3 pyramidal neurons activates TrkB receptors causing long-term potentiation (LTP) of GABAergic transmission, expressed as an increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABA-A receptor-dependent spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sGABA-A-sPSCs; Gubellini et al., J Neurosci. 25:5796-802, 2005). This form of synaptic plasticity is restricted to the neonatal period of rat development, which is equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. We hypothesized that this sGABA-A-sPSCs LTP is affected by ethanol exposure during this developmental period. To test this hypothesis, we exposed neonatal rat pups with their mothers to air or ethanol between postnatal days (P) 2 and 8 for 4 hours per day (peak serum ethanol concentrations = 40-50 mM). Immediately after the end of the 4 hr exposure, neonatal rats were euthanized and brain coronal slices were then prepared. After a recovery time of 1.5-6 hrs, sGABA-A-PSCs were recorded from CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in presence of kynurenate (1mM) at a holding potential of -65 mV before and after the application of 20 depolarizing pulses (500 ms each, from -85 to 0) delivered at 0.1 Hz. The pulses induced sGABA-A-PSC LTP in slices from neonates exposed to air but not those exposed to ethanol and this effect was reversible 48 hrs after ethanol withdrawal. Bath application of BDNF induced sGABA-A-PSC LTP to a similar extend in both treatment groups, suggesting that TrkB receptor function is unaffected by ethanol and that it rather acts by inhibiting release of endogenous BDNF. These alterations in BDNF-dependent plasticity may impair normal GABAergic synapse development and be a cellular underpinning of the learning and memory alterations that are associated with FASD.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal exposure to alcohol has been shown to alter the levels of biogenic amines in several regions of the brain. In vitro studies have revealed damage the serotonin (5-HT) system in the brain during the course of neural development. Early life impairment of this system has been linked to behavioral abnormalities and may be related to behaviors often displayed by individuals born with fetal alcohol (FA) exposure. Positron emission tomography (PET) neuroligand imaging is ideally suited to investigate in vivo changes in the serotonin system caused by fetal alcohol exposure. The goal of this work is to investigate the imaging characteristics of a promising 5-HT1A serotonin neuroligand, [F-18]mefway, for measuring potential neurochemical alterations in subjects receiving prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: High resolution PET scans were acquired in the rhesus monkey using [F-18]mefway and compared to the in vivo kinetics of [F-18]MPPF, another more commonly used 5-HT1A PET ligand. The time course of the radiotracer kinetics were followed over the course of 2 hours and arterial plasma samples were acquired to assay the fraction of parent radiotracer. Results: [F-18]Mefway revealed high uptake in the regions of the hippocampus, raphe nuclei and cingulate gyrus. The specifically bound to free (B/F) ratios in these regions was approximately 2-fold greater with [F-18]mefway (B/F = 8 in hippocampus) and approached a pseudo-equilibrium at approximately 60 minutes, suggesting stable measurements of specific binding will be achievable within a reasonable time period (< 2 hours). Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest [F-18]mefway possesses superior imaging characteristics to [F-18]MPPF and will improve the sensitivity for detecting group differences in 5-HT1A binding. Work is ongoing to investigate a cohort of rhesus monkeys receiving prenatal alcohol exposure. [F-18]Mefway PET imaging holds great promise for studying FA-exposure on the development of the 5-HT1A receptors within the serotonergic network of the brain.

N2  - Emerging information indicates that epigenetic modification regulates maintenance and differentiation of neural stem cells. Alcohol abuse during pregnancy attributable to neurodevelopmental deficits and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is known to link with alteration in methyl and acetyl donors, thus epigenetic processes may have a causal input for FAS. In this study, through monitoring both neural tube and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neural stem cell development, we demonstrated the dynamic nature of epigenetic marks throughout neural differentiation, and that alcohol interferes with these epigenetic and developmental processes. The DNA methylation in the neural tube were found to be increased along the differentiation of the neural tube in spatial and temporal pattern as indicated by the markers, 5 Methyl cytosine (5meC) and DNA methyl transferase (DNMT). Alcohol exposure at the stage of neurulation deterred DNA methylation pattern of the neural tube and concurrently the neural tube development. The DRG stem cells also demonstrated epigenetic change as waking from quiescent into differentiating states. The modification of DNA methylation and histone marks was in parallel with phenotype changes. Alcohol inhibited genome-wide DNA hypermethylation and meanwhile affected migration and differentiation. Alcohol also altered nuclear distribution of DNA methylation and histone methylation marks. In verifying the rule of DNA methylation, inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-Aza-cystidine were found to severely disrupt migration and differentiation of DRG stem cells. These results indicate that alcohol alters epigenetic programming while affecting neural differentiation. The causal relationship of epigenetic changes and neural differentiation by alcohol however requires further investigation (support AA016698).

N2  - Objective. To describe the prevalence, characteristics and risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS among schoolgoing children in Grade 1 in Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Design. A cross-sectional study using a two-tiered method for ascertainment of FAS/partial FAS cases, comprising: screening of growth parameters, diagnostic assessment for screen-positive children using clinical and neurocognitive assessments, and maternal history of drinking during pregnancy. Mothers or caregivers of FAS children and matched controls were interviewed. Setting. Primary schools in De Aar (8) and Upington (15). Subjects. Grade 1 pupils in 2001 (De Aar, N=536) and 2002 (Upington, N=1 299). Outcome measures. FAS or partial FAS. Results. The prevalence of FAS/partial FAS was high: 64/536 (119.4/1 000, 95% CI 93.2 - 149.9) in De Aar, and 97/1 299 (74.7/1 000, 95% CI 61.0 - 90.3) in Upington. Overall, 67.2 per 1 000 children (95% CI 56.2 - 79.7) had full FAS features. Growth retardation was also common in this population: 66.6% (1 181/1 774) were underweight, 48.3% (858/1 776) stunted, and 15.1% had a head circumference <2 SD for age. Mothers of children with FAS were less likely to have fulltime employment or have attended secondary school and had lower body mass index, and about 80% currently smoked. Over two-thirds of all pregnancies had been unplanned. Conclusions. A very high proportion of pupils (nearly 1 in 10) had FAS/ partial FAS, the rate in De Aar being the highest yet described in South Africa. FAS/partial FAS may contribute to the extremely high rate of growth retardation in South Africa as a whole and is a major cause of learning disability. These epidemiological features are important in designing preventive interventions.

N2  - Heavy fetal alcohol exposure is associated with a spectrum of neurological abnormalities, although the mechanism of injury is largely unknown. We previously reported attenuated cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia in fetal and newborn sheep which were exposed to alcohol earlier in pregnancy. One possible mechanism for this effect of alcohol on the developing cerebral vasculature is a decrease in cerebral microvessel density, similar to its effect on developing neurons. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal alcohol exposure decreases cerebral microvessel density. Pregnant ewes received intravenous infusions of ethanol or saline during days 60-84 of gestation (term = 150 days) and at 125 days of gestation we obtained the fetal brains for study. We immunohistochemically labeled vessels of the left cerebral forebrain hemispheres with antibody to endothelial nitric oxide synthase and then obtained unbiased stereological estimates of cerebral microvessel density using a modified optical fractionator method. We studied 20 fetal brains of which 9 were alcohol-exposed, 11 were saline-controls, and all were products of a twin gestation. Although brain and body weights were not different between groups, the alcohol-exposed group had significantly lower brain weight as a percentage of body weight. Estimates of cerebral microvessel density were not significantly different between alcohol-exposed and saline-control groups: 12.7 +/- 8.7 and 9.1 +/- 2.8 microvessels per mm3, respectively (mean +/- SD, p = 0.32). Since there is no change in estimated cerebral microvessel density after prenatal alcohol exposure, we conclude that decreased cerebral microvessel density is not a likely explanation for attenuated cerebral blood flow in response to hypoxia. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: A multi-state consortium was developed in the US to conduct baseline data collection and intervention research on fetal alcohol syndrome. Each state employed support specialists whose job it was to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption in women who were at high risk for drinking alcohol during their pregnancy. The purpose of this paper is to report how support specialists in three primarily rural/frontier states were trained to assess client need and how client need was actually assessed in the field. Methods: A qualitative process evaluation was conducted using semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted with state staff involved in support specialist training and consortium activities and the support specialists themselves. Inductive analyses were conducted with interview data. Results: Need determination varied by state and for one state within the state. How support specialists were trained to assess need and how need was assessed in the field was mostly congruent. Conclusion: Process evaluation is an effective method for providing practical and useful answers to questions that cannot be answered by outcome evaluation alone. © 2007 Christopher et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether fetal alcohol exposure contributes to alcohol use in adolescence. In this study, we examine the association between maternal alcohol use in pregnancy and adolescents' drinking patterns at age 14. METHODS: The association of maternal alcohol exposure with early drinking was examined in 4363 adolescents taking part to the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) and its outcomes, a population based birth cohort study commenced in Brisbane (Australia) in 1981. Mothers and children were followed up at birth, 5 and 14 years after the initial interview. Maternal alcohol use was assessed before and during pregnancy and at the 5 years follow-up. Adolescents' alcohol use was assessed at child age 14. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis those born of mothers who consumed 3+ glasses during pregnancy were at increased risk to report drinking 3+ glasses compared with those whose mothers reported no drinking or drinking up to 2 glasses. Comparisons controlling for drinking before pregnancy and at age 5 found the averaged odds ratio of maternal drinking in pregnancy on risk of reporting alcohol consumption of 3 and more glasses at age 14 was 2.74 (CI 1.70, 4.22). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that they maybe a biological origin of early drinking. Further studies are needed to better disentangle the nature of the association and the role of other possible confounding factors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the most common form of nongenetic birth defect in North America with devastating, long-term consequences. Physicians are the primary providers of medical care for pregnant women and they play an important role in the prevention and diagnosis of FASD. We sought to determine whether differences exist between rural and urban health care providers in knowledge of, attitudes about and awareness of FASD and preconception counselling. METHODS: Surveys were mailed to a national, random sample of Canadian health care providers (n = 5361) between October 2001 and May 2002. Bivariate data analysis was completed using SPSS 14.0. RESULTS: Compared with their urban counterparts, rural providers were more likely to report being prepared to access resources related to alcohol use and dependency, yet they were less likely to agree that it was the physician's role to manage these issues (78.4% v. 82.8%, p < 0.05). Rural providers were more likely than urban providers to use a standardized tool to screen patients for alcohol use, to ask all pregnant women if they were drinking, to have cared for a patient with an FASD (56.7% v. 48.8%), to agree that providers do not make a diagnosis because of lack of time and training, and to recognize legal issues and inappropriate behaviour as secondary outcomes of FASD. Rural and urban providers were similar in their diagnostic knowledge of FASD. CONCLUSION: Few differences between rural and urban providers exist with regard to knowledge and diagnosis of FASD; however, rural providers are more prepared to access resources for women with addiction issues and are more likely to care for patients with an FASD.

T1  - The effectiveness of a multimedia program to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Lachausse R.G.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) continues to be the leading preventable cause of mental retardation in the United States. Because abstaining from alcohol prior to and throughout pregnancy is the only way to prevent FAS, some prevention programs try to target women before they become pregnant. The Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Teaching and Research Awareness Campaign (FASTRAC) is a multimedia, peer-delivered educational presentation designed to reduce the incidence of FAS. Results from an ethnically diverse sample of high school students indicate that the program increased participants' knowledge regarding FAS but had no significant effect on participants' attitudes, beliefs about the dangers of FAS or intention to use alcohol during pregnancy. The FASTRAC program failed partly because of its didactic approach and the lack of health education principles that have been shown to be effective in changing other substance use behaviors. Suggestions for improving FAS prevention education programs are offered.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Preventing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) by encouraging pregnant women to abstain from drinking alcohol competes with commercial alcohol marketing. Two FAS-prevention campaigns using a narrowcast approach among young women of childbearing age in two disadvantaged Southern California communities are compared. The design, implementation process, and degree to which campaigns reached the priority populations are the focus of this article. Formative research shows that young women in disadvantaged communities receive mixed messages about dangers of drinking during pregnancy. A social norms approach using positive role models was the most acceptable message strategy based on materials pretesting. Differences in campaign implementation and distribution strategies between communities were documented through program monitoring. Survey research indicated the more viable messaging and implementation strategies. Findings show that low-cost community campaigns are feasible; however, variations in messaging, distribution strategies, and saturation levels determine whether such campaigns succeed or fail to reach priority populations.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can seriously harm the fetus, dependent on time, duration and frequency of exposure. The variety of outcomes is subsumed under the term <> (FASD). Diagnostic classification by means of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code results from the occurence of four key characteristics: Growth retardation, facial anomalies, CNS abnormalities (microcephaly, mental retardation, functional problems and behavioral problems) and prenatal alcohol exposure. As the facial characteristics are often discrete, the focus lies on the behavioral problems. Foster parents (most of the affected children do not stay with their biological parents) are overstrained by the everyday life with their alcohol affected children. An early diagnosis is necessary to release the foster families and to develop an appropriate concept for supporting the children according to their capabilities. Therefore a supportive network of attending pediatricians, <>, therapists and youth welfare offices with specific support for foster parents. This network aims at avoiding the adverse development and the multiple punishment of the affected children by brain dysfunction, postnatal traumatic experiences in the birth families and the danger of anew breakups of relationships due to the serious behavioral problems. Primary prevention, multigenerational projects and the acceptance of FASD as a disability pose a challenge to the whole society.

N2  - Background: Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy leads to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in their children. FASD is characterized by typical facial features, growth retardation, intellectual dysfunction and behavioral problems. Justification: Alcohol is neurotoxic to the brain during the developmental stage. Behavioral problems in children with FASD start at an early age and progress to adulthood. It is an important preventable cause of intellectual dysfunction and behavioral problems. This article reviews current prevalence, clinical features, pathogenesis and differential diagnosis of FASD. It also highlights the need for physicians to be aware of this condition. Search strategy: Articles were searched on the internet using 'fetal alcohol syndrome', 'fetal alcohol spectrum disorders', 'women and alcohol'. Following links were used to locate journals; EBSCO, OVID, Science Direct, PubMed and NIAAA. Main conclusions: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a spectrum of deficits. Though physical features are essential to make the diagnosis of FAS, it is important to note that neurocognitive and behavioural deficits can be present in the absence of physical features (alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder or ARND). Because there is no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, abstinence from alcohol for women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy must be strongly advised.

N2  - Objective: Although the classic features of fetal alcohol syndrome have been recognized since 1968, research on alcohol teratogenesis has only recently demonstrated that the brain is the organ in the body most vulnerable to the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. In this present article, we reviewed the literature focusing mainly on behavioral disturbances related to prenatal ethanol exposure. Sources: We performed a PubMed search on the literature published between 1968 and 2006 using the terms ethanol, pregnancy and behavior. We limited our search to studies on humans. Summary of the findings: The data presented in this review suggested that youths with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are at risk of disruptive social behavior, among other neurobehavioral abnormalities. Conclusions: Although it is still impossible to completely separate brain teratogenesis secondary to alcohol exposure from environmental postnatal influences as the definite cause for these outcomes, the pediatrician should be encouraged to early diagnose children affected by fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This provides proper management and care and avoids long-term consequences on their behavior, besides ensuring better and productive school and social adaptation.

N2  - Ethanol is now considered the most common human teratogen. Educational campaigns have not reduced the incidence of ethanol-mediated teratogenesis, leading to a growing interest in the development of therapeutic prevention or mitigation strategies. On the basis of the observation that maternal ethanol consumption reduces maternal and fetal pH, we hypothesized that a pH-sensitive pathway involving the TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium channels (TASKs) is implicated in ethanol-induced injury to the fetal cerebellum, one of the most sensitive targets of prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant ewes were intravenously infused with ethanol (258 +/- 10 mg/dl peak blood ethanol concentration) or saline in a "3 days/wk binge" pattern throughout the third trimester. Quantitative stereological analysis demonstrated that ethanol resulted in a 45% reduction in the total number of fetal cerebellar Purkinje cells, the cell type most sensitive to developmental ethanol exposure. Extracellular pH manipulation to create the same degree and pattern of pH fall caused by ethanol (manipulations large enough to inhibit TASK 1 channels), resulted in a 24% decrease in Purkinje cell number. We determined immunohistochemically that TASK 1 channels are expressed in Purkinje cells and that the TASK 3 isoform is expressed in granule cells of the ovine fetal cerebellum. Pharmacological blockade of both TASK 1 and TASK 3 channels simultaneous with ethanol effectively prevented any reduction in fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell number. These results demonstrate for the first time functional significance of fetal cerebellar two-pore domain pH-sensitive channels and establishes them as a potential therapeutic target for prevention of ethanol teratogenesis.

N2  - Background: Although a large body of literature exists on cognitive functioning in alcohol-exposed children, it is unclear if there is a signature neuropsychological profile in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study assesses cognitive functioning in children with FASD from several American Indian reservations in the Northern Plains States, and it applies a hierarchical model of simple versus complex information processing to further examine cognitive function. We hypothesized that complex tests would discriminate between children with FASD and culturally similar controls, while children with FASD would perform similar to controls on relatively simple tests. Methods: Our sample includes 32 control children and 24 children with a form of FASD [fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) = 10, partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) = 14]. The test battery measures general cognitive ability, verbal fluency, executive functioning, memory, and fine-motor skills. Results: Many of the neuropsychological tests produced results consistent with a hierarchical model of simple versus complex processing. The complexity of the tests was determined "a priori" based on the number of cognitive processes involved in them. Multidimensional scaling was used to statistically analyze the accuracy of classifying the neurocognitive tests into a simple versus complex dichotomy. Hierarchical logistic regression models were then used to define the contribution made by complex versus simple tests in predicting the significant differences between children with FASD and controls. Complex test items discriminated better than simple test items. The tests that conformed well to the model were the Verbal Fluency, Progressive Planning Test (PPT), the Lhermitte memory tasks, and the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT). The FASD-grouped children, when compared with controls, demonstrated impaired performance on letter fluency, while their performance was similar on category fluency. On the more complex PPT trials (problems 5 to 8), as well as the Lhermitte logical tasks, the FASD group performed the worst. Conclusions: The differential performance between children with FASD and controls was evident across various neuropsychological measures. The children with FASD performed significantly more poorly on the complex tasks than did the controls. The identification of a neurobehavioral profile in children with prenatal alcohol exposure will help clinicians identify and diagnose children with FASD. © Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Chronic binge ethanol-mediated acidemia reduces availability of glutamine and related amino acids in maternal plasma of pregnant sheep

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Heavy drinking during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), of which, fetal and postnatal growth retardation and central nervous system deficits are cardinal features. Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed, none fully account for these deficiencies. We have previously reported that maternal ethanol exposure (1.75 g/kg) results in transient acidemia in the mother and fetus. Alterations in pH are known to regulate glutamine homeostasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that chronic binge ethanol-mediated acidosis reduces glutamine concentrations in maternal plasma that result in decreases in the circulating levels of amino acids related to glutamine metabolism. Pregnant ewes were divided into three groups: ethanol (1.75 g/kg), saline control, and acidemia (inspired fractional carbon dioxide [CO2] was manipulated to mimic the maternal arterial pH pattern created by ethanol). The experiment was conducted on three consecutive days followed by four days without treatment beginning on gestational day (GD) 109, continuing to GD 132. Plasma samples were analyzed for nutrients and metabolites using HPLC and spectrophotometric methods. Maternal plasma concentrations of glutamate increased (58%), whereas glutamine, citrulline, and arginine decreased (between 14 and 53%) in response to an acute challenge after the chronic exposure in ethanol-treated ewes. No differences in these amino acid concentrations were noted between the ethanol and acidemic group subjects. Maternal plasma lactate levels increased by ~100% in response to ethanol, whereas glucose and urea levels did not change in any group. We conclude that maternal chronic binge ethanol consumption results in acidosis-mediated reductions in circulating levels of glutamine and related amino acids that could be responsible for neuronal deficits, altered fetal growth, development, and programming. We also speculate that the consequent increase in fetal glutamate during critical periods of brain development may contribute to the pathogenesis of FAS. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Cell proliferation and differentiation are critical processes in a developing fetal rat brain, during which programmed cell death (PCD) also plays an important role. One of the decisive factors for PCD is Bcl-2 family proteins, where Bax induces cell death, whereas Bcl-2 acts as an inhibitor of PCD. As maternal drinking is known to cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or malformation of the fetal brain during pregnancy, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether maternal ethanol exposure alters the PCD-related Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression during fetal brain development. Pregnant female rats were orally treated with 10% ethanol and the subsequent expressions of the Bax and Bcl-2 proteins examined in the fetal brain, including the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, from gestational day (GD) 15.5 to GD 19.5, using Western blots, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. With regard to the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax proteins (Bcl-2/Bax), the Bax protein was dominant in the forebrain and midbrain of the control GD 15.5 fetuses, except for the hindbrain, when compared with the respective ethanol-treated groups. Moreover, Bcl-2 became dominant in the midbrain of the control GD 17.5 fetuses when compared with the ethanol-treated group, representing an alternation of the natural PCD process by ethanol. Furthermore, a differential expression of the Bcl-2 and Bax proteins was found in the differentiating and migrating zones of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Thus, when taken together, the present results suggest that ethanol affects PCD in the cell differentiation and migration zones of the prenatal rat brain by modulating Bax and Bcl-2 expression in an age- and area-dependent manner. Therefore, this is the first evidence that ethanol may alter FAS-associated embryonic brain development through the alteration of Bax and Bcl-2 expression. © The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

N2  - Introduction: The present review describes the different variants of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) as a consequence of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. According to international findings, some 3 000 to 4 000 affected newborns may be expected annually in Germany. Detection of these individuals in clinical practise is insufficient. Method: Selective review of the literature and report of own findings based on long-term outcome studies. Results: Key features of FASD are short stature, microcephaly, various dysmorphic features, in severe cases amongst others consisting of congenital heart disease and dysplasias of the skeleton and urogenital system, varying degrees of developmental delay including mental retardation, and a positive history of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. Long-term outcome studies in young adulthood show that independent of the severity of FASD the key features remain associated with limitations of an independent life-style. Discussion: Pathogenesis of FASD is not sufficiently clear and there is no causal treatment. Thus, besides prevention and information, early diagnosis, installation of fostering or adoption, and intensive psychosocial care including selection of appropriate schooling, occupational counselling and supportive care in adulthood are mandatory. © Deutscher Arzte-Verlag; entwickelt von L.N.

N2  - Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) show deficits in verbal learning and spatial memory, as well as abnormal hippocampal development. The relationship between their memory and neuroanatomic impairments, however, has not been directly explored. Given that the hippocampus is integral for the synthesis and retrieval of learned information and is particularly vulnerable to the teratogenic effects of alcohol, we assessed whether reduced learning and recall abilities in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are associated with abnormal hippocampal volumes. Nineteen children with FASDs and 18 typically developing controls aged 9 to 15 years were assessed for verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall and underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Images were analyzed for total intracranial volume and for right and left hippocampal volumes. Results revealed smaller left hippocampi and poorer verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall performance in children with FASDs than controls, as well as positive correlations between selective memory indices and hippocampal volumes only in the FASD group. Additionally, hippocampal volumes increased significantly with age in controls only, suggesting that PAE may be associated with long-term abnormalities in hippocampal development that may contribute to impaired verbal learning and verbal and spatial recall. © 2008 INS.

N2  - Background: The precise pathway by which alcohol causes the characteristic features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is unknown. Proposed mechanisms for fetal injury from maternal alcohol use include cellular damage from oxidative stress and impaired fetal oxygenation related to maternal systemic vasoconstriction. Our objective was to compare the levels of urinary markers of oxidative stress and systemic vasoconstriction between women consuming large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy and women who did not drink alcohol during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women consuming >48 g alcohol per day (n = 29) on average and pregnant women who abstained from alcohol use (n = 39) were identified using detailed interviews and home visits. Random maternal urine specimens were collected. Urinary levels of the oxidative stress marker, 8-isoprostane F2alpha, and of the vasoactive prostaglandin metabolites, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (a vasodilator) and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (a vasoconstrictor), were measured using mass spectrometric methods. All analyte levels were corrected for urinary creatinine. Results: In crude analyses, there was no significant difference in 8-isoprostane F2alpha between pregnant drinkers and nondrinkers (2.16 vs. 2.08 ng/mg creatinine, respectively, p = 0.87). There were no significant differences between the drinking and nondrinking groups in levels of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (1.03 vs. 1.17 ng/mg creatinine, repectively, p = 0.50), 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (0.72 vs. 0.59 ng/mg creatinine, respectively, p = 0.21), or the ratio of vasodilatory metabolite to vasoconstrictive metabolite (1.73 vs. 2.72, respectively, p = 0.14). Adjusting for maternal age, marital status, smoking, and gestational age at sampling did not substantially alter the results. Conclusion: Our results show no difference in levels of urinary eicosanoid markers of oxidative stress and systemic vasoconstriction between pregnant women who drink heavily and pregnant women who abstain. These findings speak against a role for maternal oxidative stress or systemic vasoconstriction in the pathogenesis of alcohol damage to the fetus.

N2  - Introduction: Characteristics of Northern Plains American Indian maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or incomplete FAS are described to more effectively prevent fetal FAS and alcohol use during pregnancy. Methods: Study 1 had 27 maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with FAS and Study 2 had 18 grandmothers with grandchildren who had incomplete FAS (cases) which were compared with 119 maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren without FAS (controls). The grandchildren were born between 1981 and 1993 on the Northern Plains. Medical records were manually reviewed for each case and control grandmother. Data were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel chi square. Results: Study 1 case grandmothers were more likely to experience medical problems (70.4%) including trauma (48.1%) and injuries (51.9%) than the controls. Most of the Study 1 and 2 case grandmothers (92.6% and 77.8%, respectively) had alcohol use documented in their medical records compared to less than half of the control grandmothers. Seven (15.6%) of the case grandmothers had more than one grandchild in either Study 1 or Study 2. Conclusion: Maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with FAS had significantly higher rates of alcohol use and alcohol-related medical problems than control grandmothers. Antenatal care providers should screen pregnant women for alcohol use at their first visit. The provider needs to ask the women who are using alcohol about their mothers' use of alcohol to provide appropriate care and counseling for the women and prevent FAS. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Women giving birth to children with fetal alcohol syndrome have a higher risk of early mortality. However, the risk of increased mortality associated with drinking at lower levels during pregnancy has not been evaluated previously. Accordingly, mortality at 20 years post recruitment was examined in a sample (N = 570) of women recruited between 1980 and 1986, who drank more than 1 ounce of absolute alcohol per week (oz AA/wk) during pregnancy and compared to that in abstainers from the same low socioeconomic, African-American population. Using data from archival information and state mortality records, Cox proportional hazards survival models were constructed to determine whether alcohol use, cigarette use, infant birth weight, infant dysmorphia, and alcohol use and abuse by the woman's own mother (family history positive) were associated with increased risk for mortality. At follow-up (in 2003), 9.5% of the sample had died, with the rate for controls being 3.6%, for those alcohol users who stopped during pregnancy, 12.7%, and for the alcohol users who continued drinking throughout pregnancy, 12.5%. Thus, women using alcohol in pregnancy, whether they stopped or continued to use, were significantly (chi2 (2) = 12.1, P < .01) more likely than abstainers to have died before follow-up. Nondrinkers' mortality rate was lower than that of other women from this low-income, high-risk population, whereas the drinkers' rate was 2.7 times higher. In a multivariate analysis, factors contributing to mortality risk included alcohol use and cigarette smoking, but not infant birth weight. Drinking at any level during pregnancy should be regarded as a risk factor for the mother as well as for offspring. Health care professionals working with such women should provide counseling and support for abstinence. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure causes abnormal brain development, leading to behavioral deficits, some of which can be ameliorated by environmental enrichment. As both environmental enrichment and prenatal alcohol exposure can individually alter neurotrophin expression, we studied the interaction of prenatal alcohol and postweaning environmental enrichment on brain neurotrophin levels in rats. Methods: Pregnant rats received alcohol by gavage, 0, 4, or 6 g/kg/d (Zero, Low, or High groups), or no treatment (Naive group), on gestational days 8 to 20. After weaning on postnatal day 21, offspring were housed for 6 weeks in Isolated, Social, or Enriched conditions. Levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) were then measured in frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar vermis. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure increased NGF levels in frontal cortex (High-dose group) and cerebellar vermis (High- and Low-dose groups); increased BDNF in frontal cortex, occipital cortex and hippocampus (Low-dose groups), and increased NT-3 in hippocampus and cerebellar vermis (High-dose). Environmental enrichment resulted in lower NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 levels in occipital cortex and lower NGF in frontal cortex. The only significant interaction between prenatal alcohol treatment and environment was in cerebellar vermis where NT-3 levels were higher for enriched animals after prenatal alcohol exposure, but not for animals housed under Isolated or Social conditions. Conclusions: Both prenatal alcohol exposure and postweaning housing conditions alter brain neurotrophin levels, but the effects appear to be largely independent. Although environmental enrichment can improve functional outcomes, these results do not provide strong support for the hypothesis that rearing in a complex environment ameliorates prenatal alcohol effects on brain neurotrophin levels in rats.

N2  - Background: Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments, including structural brain damage. Despite the importance of white matter connections for proper brain function, little is known about how these connections, and the deep gray matter structures that act as relay stations, are affected in children with FASD. The purpose of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging, an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique, to examine microstructural differences of white and deep gray matter in children with FASD. Methods: Subjects were 24 children aged 5-13 years previously diagnosed with FASD and 95 healthy children over the same age range. Diffusion tractography was used to delineate 10 major white matter tracts in each individual, and region-of-interest analysis was used to assess 4 deep gray matter structures. Fractional anisotropy, an indicator of white matter integrity, and mean diffusivity, a measure of the average water diffusion, were assessed in all 14 brain structures. Results: Diffusion tensor imaging revealed significant differences of diffusion parameters in several areas of the brain, including the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, cingulum, corticospinal tracts, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, globus pallidus, putamen, and thalamus. Reduced white and gray matter volumes, as well as total brain volume, were observed in the FASD group. Conclusions: These results demonstrate diffusion abnormalities in FASD beyond the corpus callosum and suggest that several specific white matter regions, particularly commissural and temporal connections, and deep gray matter areas of the brain are sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: Maternal drinking during pregnancy can lead to a range of deleterious outcomes in the developing offspring that have been collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). There is interest and recognized value in using non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to characterize, respectively, structural and biochemical alterations in individuals with FASDs. To date, however, results with MRS have been inconsistent regarding the degree and/or nature of abnormalities. Methods: High-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) proton (1H) MRS is an ex vivo neuroimaging technique that can acquire spectra in small punches of intact tissue, providing clinically relevant neurochemical information about discrete brain regions. In this study, HR-MAS 1H MRS was used to examine regional neurochemistry in frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum of young rats previously exposed to ethanol as neonates. Key neurochemicals of interest included N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glutamate, GABA, glutamine, creatine, choline and myo-inositol. Results: Daily neonatal alcohol exposure from postnatal day 4 (PN4) through PN9 significantly reduced levels of NAA and taurine in the cerebellum and striatum, and induced sex-dependent reductions in cerebellar glutamate when measured on PN16. In addition, myo-inositol was significantly increased in cerebellum. The frontal cortex and hippocampus were virtually unaffected by this neonatal alcohol exposure. Conclusion: Results of this research may have implications for understanding the underlying neurobiology associated with FASDs and aid in testing treatments in the future. Ongoing studies are assessing the developmental persistence of and/or maturational recovery from these changes. Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - A diagnostically promising technique for tallying nominal reference errors in the narratives of school-aged children with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)
A1  - Thorne J.C.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background: Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) include the range of disabilities that occur in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy, with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) on the severe end of the spectrum. Clinical research has documented a range of cognitive, social, and communication deficits in FASD and it indicates the need for diagnostic tools that can identify children with diminished communicative capacities resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Previous research indicates that analysis of nominal reference errors within narrative discourse may provide such a tool. Aims: To demonstrate the potential diagnostic utility of a new tool for tallying nominal reference errors in the oral narratives of school-aged children with FASD by presenting quantitative measurement data that address interrater agreement and predictive accuracy. Methods and Procedures: Retrospective analysis was conducted on spontaneously produced oral narratives from 32 school-aged children (8;5-11;7) with a range of socio-economic and ethnic profiles. Sixteen of the children had been previously diagnosis with an FASD, including five with full or partial FAS (pFAS). The remaining 16 children were considered typically developing (TD). A range of methods for calculating the rate of nominal reference errors (rNRE) were used to predict which narratives were produced by children from each group. Accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) for two predictions (FASD versus TD, and FAS/pFAS versus all others) was quantified using receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses. Pairwise statistical comparisons were made between methods to determine which had the most diagnostic potential. Outcomes and Results: The proposed system for calculating the rNRE was highly accurate at predicting which narratives were produced by children with FASD (versus TD, 88% overall accuracy), and which were produced by children with FAS/pFAS (versus all others, 97% overall accuracy), and outperformed all other methods tested. Agreement on coding decisions between independent judges was high (kappa=0.90). Conclusions: The strong predictive accuracy demonstrated in this study provides empirical evidence that the system proposed in this feasibility study has sufficient sensitivity and diagnostic utility to warrant further development for use with children suspected of prenatal alcohol exposure. It also points to the potential for the tool to be used with other clinical populations that, even in the absence of a confirmed alcohol exposure, share many of the communication challenges of this complex clinical population. © 2008 Royal College of Speech & Language Therapists.

N2  - Background: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have documented impairments in executive functioning (EF). One component of EF, concept formation, has not been well studied in this group. Methods: Children (8 to 18 years) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with and without fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), were compared to typically developing controls on 2 measures of concept formation and conceptual set shifting: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the Card Sorting Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System. In addition to between-group comparisons, performance relative to overall intellectual functioning was examined. Results: Children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure showed impairment on both tests of concept formation compared to non-exposed controls. These deficits included difficulty generating and verbalizing concepts, increased error rates and perseverative responses, and poorer response to feedback. However, in comparison to controls, alcohol-exposed children performed better on measures of concept formation than predicted by their overall IQ scores. Exploratory analyses suggest that this may be due to differences in how the measures relate at different IQ levels and may not be specific to prenatal alcohol exposure. Conclusions: Deficits in concept formation and conceptual set shifting were observed in alcohol-exposed children with or without the diagnosis of FAS and in the absence of mental retardation. These deficits likely impact problem solving skills and adaptive functioning and have implications for therapeutic interventions in this population.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: New Zealand birth mothers' experiences
A1  - Salmon J.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The aim of this study was to describe the 'lived' experiences of New Zealand birth mothers, from pregnancy onwards, of a child/ren diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Method: A qualitative paradigm was utilized so that the participants could tell their stories through words and text rather than collecting statistical data which is the domain of quantitative research. The adoption of a feminist standpoint theory bridged a communication gap, adjusted the balance of power within society and gave visibility and voice to the women. Eight New Zealand-resident multipara biological mothers ages 18 and over, who had nurtured or were still living with their affected offspring, were studied. Their ages ranged from 29 to 64. The mothers were interviewed in depth, face-to-face, using unstructured, open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Results: The mothers described a range of issues of concern for their disabled offspring and themselves (as advocates) relating to health, social, educational, judicial systems, lack of knowledge by professionals and problems in diagnosis, to being oppressed and stigmatized. Cognitive concerns for the offspring included attention-deficit, absence of fear, diminished memory and comprehension and inability to acknowledge and understand consequences. Behavioural issues included excessive crying or no crying as a baby, lying, stealing, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, destructiveness, sexual promiscuity and few friends. Other issues of concern were delayed milestones and numerous health problems. All mothers stated that the pregnancy, labour and delivery of their child with FASD were different from their other non-compromised pregnancies/labours/deliveries. Most mothers said that the doctors used medical language which they did not understand, thus giving power to the former. Seven mothers were either married to or partners of alcoholics when they conceived their offspring with FASD. All mothers had been drinking alcohol before becoming pregnant. Six mothers came from drinking families. Most mothers continued to consume alcohol because they did not know that they had conceived. All mothers were unaware of FASD and its effects on the unborn child. Eight babies had low Apgar scores with an average of 6 (out of 10) and low birth weight (average 6lb 2oz). An Apgar score is a numerical expression of an infant's condition, usually determined at 60 seconds after birth, based on heart rate, respiratory efforts, muscle tone, reflex irritability and colour. All women were of middle to high socio-economic status. Seven mothers experienced family breakdown as a result of alcohol consumption by the biological father of the child with FASD. All women feared for their child's future. Conclusion: Health, social, educational, judicial professionals, policy-makers and agencies, need to understand and be educated in the daily realities and complex problems that children with FASD and their families face. Only then will the correct diagnosis be made so that these individuals can receive the nurturing, needs, education, funding and support they require in order to live full and meaningful lives and have the quality of life they deserve. ©2008 Canadian Society for Clinical Pharmacology.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - New draft alcohol guidelines for Australia state that, for pregnant women and women planning pregnancy, 'no drinking is the safest option'. One of the best known adverse effects of alcohol exposure on the fetus is the fetal alcohol syndrome. Others include alcohol-related birth defects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders and increased risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth and low birthweight. Over half of Australian women consume alcohol during pregnancy. Obstetricians have a pivotal role in advising women of the effects of alcohol on the fetus and reducing fetal exposure. © 2008 The Authors.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been identified as a major cause of impairment to normal physical and intellectual development among Indigenous children in Far North Queensland; however, little is known of the pregnancy characteristics of mothers of those children diagnosed with FAS or of interventions that might assist in lowering the prevalence of the syndrome. Aim: To review the pregnancy records of women whose infants were subsequently diagnosed with FAS by the Paediatric Outreach Service (POS) of the Cairns Base Hospital, and to determine how such women might be identified prospectively in pregnancy and offered intervention to reduce alcohol consumption. Methods: A retrospective case-control study involving all children diagnosed with FAS by the POS between 1994 and 2006; maternal pregnancy records were accessed and details obtained. Results: Mothers of cases were older, of higher parity, smoked more cigarettes, attended fewer antenatal visits and experienced more antenatal and delivery complications than mothers of controls. The average gestational age at booking was not statistically significant between the two groups. There was a significant difference between the two groups in self-reported alcohol consumption both before and during pregnancy and in numbers of women who decreased alcohol consumption once the diagnosis of pregnancy was known to them. Conclusions: There is the potential to identify prospectively women presenting for antenatal care who are heavy drinkers and risk FAS in their infants, using the self-reported information about alcohol intake already being collected by our service; such women may then be offered specific interventions to try to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnancy. © 2008 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), a severe consequence of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, is associated with craniofacial defects, mental retardation, and stunted growth. Previous studies in C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice provide evidence that alcohol-induced pathogenesis follows early changes in gene expression within specific molecular pathways in the embryonic headfold. Whereas the former (B6J) pregnancies carry a high-risk for dysmorphogenesis following maternal exposure to 2.9 g/kg alcohol (two injections spaced 4.0 h apart on gestation day 8), the latter (B6N) pregnancies carry a low-risk for malformations. The present study used this murine model to screen amniotic fluid for biomarkers that could potentially discriminate between FAS-positive and FAS-negative pregnancies. METHODS: B6J and B6N litters were treated with alcohol (exposed) or saline (control) on day 8 of gestation. Amniotic fluid aspirated on day 17 (n = 6 replicate litters per group) was subjected to trypsin digestion for analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry with the aid of denoising algorithms, statistical testing, and classification methods. RESULTS: We identified several peaks in the proteomics screen that were reduced consistently and specifically in exposed B6J litters. Preliminary characterization by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and multidimensional protein identification mapped the reduced peaks to alpha fetoprotein (AFP). The predictive strength of AFP deficiency as a biomarker for FAS-positive litters was confirmed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSIONS: These findings in genetically susceptible mice support clinical observations in maternal serum that implicate a decrease in AFP levels following prenatal alcohol damage. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is one of the most common preventable causes of developmental disability and is currently one of the most pressing public health concerns in Canada. FASD refers to the range of physical, mental, behavioural and learning disabilities that an individual may acquire as a result of maternal alcohol consumption. Prenatal exposure to alcohol leads to numerous primary and secondary disabilities in affected children, which can result in poot long-term outcomes. The present paper reviews previous research on the neurobehavioural outcomes of children with FASD, particularly in terms of behavioural, mental health and adaptive outcomes. The role of risk and protective factors on these outcomes and the impact of FASD on the family are also examined. Finally, future directions and implications regarding outcomes research among children with FASD, particularly within a Canadian context, are discussed. ©2008 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing kidneys
A1  - Assadi F.
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Objective: Clinical and experimental studies strongly suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with zinc deficiency and impaired renal tubular function. Whether material alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes renal tubular cell injury is unknown. Material & Methods: Renal function was studied in 8 infants with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 8 healthy age-matched infants. Renal function and structure were also examined in 11 offspring of rats exposed to alcohol during gestation. Findings: Infants with FAS had limited ability to concentrate urine after water restriction (P<0.001) and impaired acidification after acute acid loading (P<0.001) compared to control group. Plasma zinc levels were lower (P<0.001) and urinary zinc excretion was higher (P<0.001) in infants with FAS compared to control infants. Scanning electron microscopic studies revealed cytoplasmic mitochondrial hypertrophy and vacuolar structures of the epithelial cells of the cortical collecting ducts in the rat kidney following fetal exposure to alcohol. Conclusion: These findings suggest that offspring of rats exposed to alcohol during fetal life have renal functional and structure abnormalities that may be responsible in the genesis of renal functional abnormalities as described in infacts with FAS.

N2  - Background: Although it is well known that France has a cultural history of alcohol use, no recent French data on alcohol consumption during pregnancy in a large sample are available. Methods: To determine the alcohol consumption patterns among pregnant women in France, we analyzed data from a 1-year multicenter self-survey. Sociodemographic profile, obstetrical history, neonatal data, and a self-report for assessing drinking patterns during pregnancy including AUDIT were recorded from women who delivered recently. Cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were also reported. Results: A total of 837 pregnant women have described all parameters. The mean age at delivery of our sample was 29.7 years (SD = 4.8 years). A total of 52.2% of women indicated that they had consumed alcohol at least once during their pregnancy, and among abstainers 54.5% had a positive AUDIT score. Of the pregnant women who consumed alcohol, 13.7% reported at least one binge drinking episode (5 or more drinks on 1 occasion) during pregnancy. Binge drinking is significantly more frequent than regular alcohol consumption (at least 1 drink more than 1 time per week) during pregnancy. A prevalence rate of FAS of 1.8 per 1,000 live births was observed. Conclusions: There is a large population of women who still drink alcohol during pregnancy, particularly in binge drinking episodes. This underlines the need to clearly inform women of childbearing age about the dangers of alcohol during pregnancy as related to all types of consumption. Moreover, acting to prevent alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy may also greatly influence prenatal drinking. Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objectives: This is a third exploration of risk factors for the two most severe forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and Partial FAS (PFAS), in a South African community with the highest reported prevalence of FAS in the world. Methods: In a case control design, interview and collateral data concerning mothers of 72 first grade children with FAS or PFAS are compared with 134 randomly selected maternal controls of children from the same schools. Results: Significant differences were found between the mothers of FASD children and controls in socio-economic status, educational attainment, and a higher prevalence of FASD among rural residents. The birth order of the index children, gravidity, and still birth were significantly higher among mothers of FASD children. Mothers of children with a FASD are less likely to be married and more likely to have a male partner who drank during the index pregnancy. Current and gestational alcohol use by mothers of FASD children is bingeing on weekends, with no reduction in drinking reported in any trimester in 75 to 90% of the pregnancies that resulted in an FAS child or during 50 to 87% of PFAS-producing pregnancies. There was significantly less drinking among the controls in the second and third trimesters (11 to 14%). Estimated peak blood alcohol concentrations (BAC)s of the mothers of PFAS children range from 0.155 in the first trimester to 0.102 in the third, and for mothers of FAS children the range is from 0.197 to 0.200 to 0.191 in the first, second, and third. Smoking percentage during pregnancy was significantly higher for mothers of FASD children (82 to 84%) than controls (35%); but average quantity smoked is low in the 3 groups at 30 to 41 cigarettes per week. A relatively young average age of the mother at the time of FAS and PFAS births (28.8 and 24.8 years respectively) is not explained by early onset of regular drinking (mean = 20.3 to 20.5 years of age). But the mean years of alcohol consumption is different between groups, 16.3, 10.7, and 12.1 years respectively for mothers of FAS, FASD, and drinking controls. Mothers of FAS and PFAS children were significantly smaller in height and weight than controls at time of interview. The child's total dysmorphology score correlates significantly with mother's weight (-0.46) and BMI (-0.39). Bivariate correlations are significant between the child's dysmorphology and known independent demographic and behavioral maternal risk factors for FASD: higher gravidity and parity; lower education and income; rural residence; drinks consumed daily, weekly, and bingeing during pregnancy; drinking in all trimesters; partner's alcohol consumption during pregnancy; and use of tobacco during pregnancy. Similar significant correlations were also found for most of the above independent maternal risk variables and the child's verbal IQ, non-verbal IQ and behavioral problems. Conclusions: Maternal data in this population are generally consistent with a spectrum of effects exhibited in the children. Variation within the spectrum links greater alcohol doses with a greater severity of effects among children of older and smaller mothers of lower socio economic status in their later pregnancies. Prevention is needed to address known maternal risk factors for FASD in this population. Copyright © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

T1  - Determination of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair: A promising way for retrospective detection of alcohol abuse during pregnancy?

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The retrospective detection of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is an important part of the diagnosis of the fetal alcohol syndrome. A promising way to solve this problem can be the determination of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) or/and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair of the mothers. In this article, the present state in analytical determination and interpretation of FAEE and EtG concentrations in hair are reviewed. Both FAEE and EtG are minor metabolites of ethanol and as direct alcohol markers very specific for alcohol. They are durably deposited in hair, which enables taking advantage of the long diagnostic time window of this sample material. In the last years, specific and sensitive methods for determination of both alcohol markers in hair were developed. Headspace solid phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy after hair extraction with an n-heptane/dimethylsulfoxide mixture proved to be a favorable technique for determination of four characteristic FAEE (ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate). EtG is extracted from hair by water and analyzed either by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy with negative chemical ionization after cleanup with solid phase extraction and derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride or by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy. The detection limits of the single FAEE as well as of EtG are in the range of 1 to 10 pg/mg. FAEE as well as EtG were determined in a larger number of hair samples of teetotalers, social drinkers, patients in alcohol withdrawal treatment, and death cases with previous known heavy drinking. From the results, the following criteria were derived: strict abstinence is excluded or improbable at CFAEE >0.2 ng/mg or CEtG >7 pg/mg. Moderate social drinkers should have CFAEE <0.5 ng/mg and CEtG <25 pg/mg; above these values, alcohol abuse is probable. Until now, there has been no evaluation in context of FAS diagnosis; however, a successful application for this purpose can be expected from the good experience in driving ability examination. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Background: Although epidemiological data indicate that White women are more likely to drink and binge drink before pregnancy, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is more common in the Black population than among Whites in the United States. Differences in drinking cessation between Black and White women who become pregnant may help explain the disparity in FAS rates. Methods: The study sample was comprised of 280,126 non-Hispanic Black and White women, ages 18 to 44, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2001 to 2005 data sets. Predictors of reduction in alcohol consumption (in drinks per month) and binge drinking (>4 drinks on one occasion) by pregnant and non-pregnant women were identified with logistic regression. The effect of interactions of pregnancy status with age, education, and Black or White race on drinks per month and binge occasions were explored using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Pregnant White women averaged 79.5% fewer drinks per month than non-pregnant White women (F = 1250.1, p < 0.001), and 85.4% fewer binge drinking occasions (F = 376, p < 0.001). Pregnant Black women averaged 58.2% fewer drinks per month than non-pregnant Black women (F = 31.8, p < 0.001) and 64.0% fewer binge occasions (F = 13.8, p < 0.001). Compared to Black women, White women appear to make a 38% greater reduction in drinks per month, and a 33% greater reduction in binge occasions. Conclusions: Non-Hispanic White women appear more likely to reduce drinks per month and binge drinking occasions than non-Hispanic Black women during pregnancy. These findings may help explain disparities in FAS in the United States, though this cross-sectional sample does not permit claims of causation. To better describe the impact of differential drinking reduction on FAS rates, future studies of longitudinal data should be done. © 2008 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Brain structural abnormalities and neurocognitive dysfunction have been observed in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Little is known about how white matter integrity is related to these functional and morphological deficits. We used a combination of diffusion tensor and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate white matter integrity in individuals with FASDs and related these findings to neurocognitive deficits. Seventeen children and adolescents with FASDs were compared with 19 typically developing age-and gender-matched controls. Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) was observed in individuals with FASDs relative to controls in the right lateral temporal lobe and bilaterally in the lateral aspects of the splenium of the corpus callosum. White matter density was also lower in some, but not all regions in which FA was lower. FA abnormalities were confirmed to be in areas of white matter in post hoc region of interest analyses, further supporting that less myelin or disorganized fiber tracts are associated with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Significant correlations between performance on a test of visuomotor integration and FA in bilateral splenium, but not temporal regions were observed within the FASD group. Correlations between the visuomotor task and FA within the splenium were not significant within the control group, and were not significant for measures of reading ability. This suggests that this region of white matter is particularly susceptible to damage from prenatal alcohol exposure and that disruption of splenial fibers in this group is associated with poorer visuomotor integration.

N2  - Background: Ethanol (ETOH) consumption by pregnant women can result in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). To date, the cellular targets and mechanisms responsible for FASD are not fully characterized. Our aim was to determine if ETOH can affect fetal human brain-derived neural progenitor cells (NPC). Methods: Neural progenitor cells were isolated by positive selection from normal second trimester fetal human brains (n = 4) and cultured, for up to 72 hours, in mitogenic media containing 0, 1, 10, or 100 mM ETOH. From 48 to 72 hours in culture, neurospheres generated in these conditions were filmed using time-lapse video microscopy. At the end of 72 hours, neurosphere diameter and roundness were measured using videographic software. Mitotic phase analysis of cell-cycle activity and apoptotic cell count were also performed at this time, by flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Real-time PCR was used to estimate expression of genes associated with cell adhesion pathways. Results: Neurosphere diameter correlated positively (r = 0.87) with increasing ETOH concentrations. There was no significant difference in cell-cycle activity and no significant increase in apoptosis with increasing ETOH concentrations. Time-lapse video microscopy showed that ETOH (100 mM) reduced the time for neurosphere coalescence. Real-time PCR analysis showed that ETOH significantly altered the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion. There was an increase in the expression of alpha and beta Laminins 1, beta Integrins 3 and 5, Secreted phosphoprotein1 and Sarcoglycan . No change in the expression of beta Actin was observed while the expression of beta Integrin 2 was significantly suppressed. Conclusions: ETOH had no effect on NPC apoptosis but, resulted in more rapid coalescence and increased volume of neurospheres. Additionally, the expression of genes associated with cell adhesion was significantly altered. ETOH induced changes in NPC surface adhesion interactions may underlie aspects of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in FASD. © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: A length polymorphism in the serotonin (5-HT) transporter gene promoter region in humans and rhesus monkeys affects functional characteristics of the brain 5-HT system. Prenatal alcohol exposure (FA-exposure) can have an impact on brain and psychosocial development that could interact with genetic endowment. This study determined whether moderate FA-exposure interacts with polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter gene to increase the incidence or severity of fetal alcohol effects in rhesus monkeys. Methods: The offspring of monkeys who did or did not consume moderate amounts of alcohol during pregnancy were assessed for temperament as neonates and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) in response to mother-infant separation at 6 months of age. Serotonin promoter region genotypes (homozygous s/s or heterozygous s/l versus homozygous l/l) were determined. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposed carriers of the s allele exhibited increased neonatal irritability and increased ACTH and CORT compared with FA-exposed monkeys homozygous for the l allele and monkeys that were not FA-exposed regardless of genotype. Conclusions: The s allele of the 5-HT transporter increases the probability of neonatal irritability and increased stress responsiveness in FA-exposed monkeys, and this gene-environment interaction may affect psychosocial development. It is probable that FA-exposure contributes to 5-HT transporter gene-environment interactions in humans. © 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

N2  - Children with either fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) display deficits in attention and executive function (EF) and differential diagnosis of these two clinical groups may be difficult, especially when information about prenatal alcohol exposure is unavailable. The current study compared EF performance of three groups: children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC); nonexposed children with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); and typically developing controls (CON). Both clinical groups met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The EF tasks used were the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Results indicated different patterns of deficit; both clinical groups displayed deficits on the WCST and a relative weakness on letter versus category fluency. Only the ALC group displayed overall deficits on letter fluency and a relative weakness on TMT-B versus TMT-A. In addition, WCST performance was significantly lower than expected based on IQ in the ADHD group and significantly higher than expected in the ALC group. These results, which indicate that, although EF deficits occurred in both clinical groups, the degree and pattern of deficit differed between the ALC and ADHD groups, may improve differential diagnosis. © 2008 The International Neuropsychological Society.

N2  - Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) have shown regional patterns of dysmorphology, most prominent in parietal and posterior temporal cortices. Various methods of image analysis have been employed in these studies, but abnormalities in cortical thickness have not yet been mapped over the entire cortical surface in individuals with FASD. Further, relationships between cognitive dysfunction and cortical thickness measures have not yet been explored. We applied cortical pattern matching algorithms and techniques for measuring cortical thickness in millimeters to the structural brain MRI images of 21 subjects with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (8-22 years, mean age 12.6 years), and 21 normally developing control subjects (8-25 years, mean age 13.5 years). Dissociable cognitive measures, of verbal recall and visuospatial functioning, were correlated with cortical thickness, and group by test score interactions were evaluated for predicting cortical thickness. Significant cortical thickness excesses of up to 1.2 mm were observed in the FASD subjects in large areas of bilateral temporal, bilateral inferior parietal, and right frontal regions. Significant group by test score interactions were found in right dorsal frontal regions for the verbal recall measure and in left occipital regions for the visuospatial measure. These results are consistent with earlier analyses from our own and other research groups, but for the first time, we show that cortical thickness is also increased in right lateral frontal regions in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Further, the significant interactions show for the first time that brain-behavior relationships are altered as a function of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. © The Author 2007.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) occurs in approximately 3 of 1,000 live births in the general population of the U.S. and is the leading known cause of mental retardation. The Midwest Regional Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Training Center (MRFASTC) surveyed 1,000 licensed occupational therapists (OT) of the American Occupational Therapists Association in a six-state Midwest region, including Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding FAS. Nearly 20% of the OTs responded. Of the respondents, nearly 94% regarded at least 1 drink per day as being 'heavy' in a pregnant woman. There was an increase in the number of respondents who thought it was acceptable to consume 1 drink or more with each advancing trimester of pregnancy. 92% of the OTs indicated a willingness to counsel a mother of a child having FAS, but 96% indicated a poor to fair ability to select valid and reliable assessment instruments for screening a child for FAS. Only 6% of the OT respondents indicated a good-excellent ability to conduct brief interventions on alcohol cessation for women. The data collectively indicate OTs possess similarities to other health care providers, including physicians and psychologists, in the misunderstanding or deficits of knowledge and skills associated with FAS and that they are largely unprepared to provide intervention for women 'at risk' for FAS, or to recognize correctly FAS in children. There is a demonstrated need, and desire, by the practicing OTs for continued education related to alcohol abuse associated with FAS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a preventable cause of developmental delay and growth failure. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the clinical features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the role of the general practitioner in prevention and management. DISCUSSION: Early diagnosis of and intervention for problems associated with FAS reduce adverse long term outcomes. Most health professionals have limited knowledge of FASD and lack confidence in the diagnosis and management of children with FASD. General practitioners have an important role in identifying women and children at risk of harm from alcohol and arranging referral for assessment and management when necessary. Educational materials for health professionals are currently under development.

T1  - Appraisal of neurobehavioral methods in environmental health research: The developing brain as a target for neurotoxic chemicals
A1  - Winneke G.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Psychological tests as developed and validated in the field of differential psychology have a longstanding tradition as tools to study individual differences. In clinical neuropsychology, global or more specific tests are used as neuropsychological tools in the differential diagnosis of various forms of brain damage or neurobehavioral dysfunction following chemical insults, such as mental sequelae of prenatal alcohol consumption by pregnant mothers (fetal alcohol syndrome) or of maternal thyroid deficiency during pregnancy. Psychometric tests are constructed to fulfill basic quality criteria, namely objectivity, reliability and validity. For strictly diagnostic purposes in individual cases they must also possess normative values based on representative reference groups. Intelligence tests or their developmental variants are often used as endpoints in environmental health research for studying neurodevelopmental adversity due to early exposure to neurotoxic chemicals in the environment. Intelligence as treated in psychology is a complex construct made up of specific cognitive functions which usually cover verbal, numerical and spatial skills, as well as perceptual speed, memory and reasoning. In this paper, case studies covering neurodevelopmental adversity of inorganic lead, of methylmercury and of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are reviewed, and the issue of postnatal behavioral sequelae of prenatal exposure is covered. In such observational studies precautions must be taken in order to avoid pitfalls of causative interpretation of associations between exposure and neurobehavioral outcome. This requires consideration of co-exposure and confounding. Important confounders considered in most modern developmental cohort studies are maternal intelligence and quality of the home environment. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Purpose: This article is a retrospective examination of environmental risk, language performance, and narrative discourse data from a clinical database of school-age children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Method: A case-defined diagnostic approach for measuring and reporting the full spectrum of disabilities in children with prenatal alcohol exposure is presented. Demographic, environmental, language, and social communication (as reflected by narrative discourse) data are reported for a large cohort of children with FASD between the ages of 6;0 (years;months) and 12;0. Results: Children with FASD are a heterogeneous group with varying levels of compromise. The data demonstrate a substantial comorbidity between the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and adverse caregiving environments. The data further reveal that school-age children with FASD often exhibit clinically meaningful deficits in language and social communication. Clinical Implication: Children with FASD may be particularly vulnerable to language and social communication deficits as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure and atypical or adverse social interactive experiences. Comprehensive assessment is recommended. Dynamic and functional assessment paradigms may document the language and social communicative deficits in children with FASD and other clinical populations with complex neurodevelopmental profiles. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Understanding the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and supporting students
A1  - Green J.H.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) affect a significant number of children in this country. This article addresses diagnostic issues related to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other alcohol-related disabilities, discusses associated features and behaviors of FASD, and introduces interventions to support children with FASD in school settings. Methods: A comprehensive review of FAS and FASD literature as it relates to school functioning was conducted. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a broad range of negative developmental consequences, including deficits in cognitive and academic functioning, psychological disorders, behavioral problems, and difficulties with independent living. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure are at risk for a spectrum of difficulties at school. Conclusions: This topic is of considerable relevance to all professionals in a school setting, including teachers, administrators, school psychologists, special education providers, special service providers, and school nurses who interact with children who may be prenatally exposed to alcohol. Successful interventions will need to balance the use of environmental modifications, immediate and meaningful positive and negative consequences for behaviors, and opportunities to teach children skills to monitor and modify their behavior. © 2007, American School Health Association.

T1  - Neurocognitive and neurobehavioral impairments in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Recognition and assessment
A1  - Paley B.
A1  - O'Connor M.J.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) represent a continuum of development disabilities associated with maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. This spectrum of disorders, which includes the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), is characterized by a wide range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. Estimates of the number of live births in the United States meeting criteria for a diagnosis of FAS range from .5 to 2 infants per 1,000, with the prevalence of the entire continuum of FASDs estimated to be 1 in 100. This paper discusses some of the complexities involved in diagnosing individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, provides a review of the neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits commonly seen in this population, and examines how such deficits may manifest during different developmental periods across the life span. Additionally, strategies for assessing these deficits are described, and specific measures that are appropriate for alcohol-exposed individuals are presented. The challenges of working with this under-identified and underserved population are highlighted, as well as the importance of early diagnosis and intervention.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in life-long primary and secondary disabilities in affected individuals. Adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and/or prenatal alcohol exposure display high rates of many risky behaviors. In this paper, we review the risky behaviors common in adolescents with FASD, including trouble with the law, delinquency, substance abuse, disrupted school experience and dropping out of school, inappropriate sexual behavior, suicidality, psychopathology, and maladaptive behavior. Next, we review factors that are related to high risk behaviors in individuals with FASD, which include executive functioning deficits, impaired decision making, and abnormalities of the prefrontal cortex. Finally, we discuss why adolescence is a period of increased risk taking and poor decision making, and how individuals with FASD are particularly vulnerable during adolescence.

N2  - Objective: To discuss relevant issues in the diagnosis of mental disorders comorbid with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: We present a theoretical model of the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurobehavioral development and a systematic review of published data on the mental disorders in subjects with an FASD. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with high rates of mental disorders. We found 48 papers reporting on 3,343 subjects. The most common mental disorder comorbid with FASD is attention deficit - hyperactivity disorder occurring in 48% of subjects with FASD. Cognitive impairment is also very common. Discussion: Prenatal alcohol exposure appears to have differential effects on outcomes leading to large increases in rates of some but apparently not most mental disorders. We discuss strategies to improve the diagnosis of mental disorders in FASD and the multiplicity of uses for this important data. Copyright © Freund Publishing House Limited.

N2  - Aims: The prenatal ethanol exposure induced neuroapoptosis and neuron loss in visual cortex would be investigated in mice at P0, P7 and P14. Methods: Intubating pregnant mice ethanol daily began on E5 and continued through the pup's birth. The neuroapoptosis in visual cortex was visualized by the caspase 3 immunocytochemistry, and the neuron loss was observed with Nissl method as well. Results: With prenatal ethanol exposure, the dose-dependent neuroapoptosis and neuron loss in visual cortex could be found at P0 and even at P7 and P14 as well. Conclusions: The prenatal ethanol exposure induced neuroapoptosis and neuron loss will persist into postnatal stage, and the long-term effect of neuroapoptosis might be one of the causes of postnatal neurobehavioural disturbances associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. © The Author 2007.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is defined as a permanent birth defect syndrome caused by maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. It is characterized by growth deficiency, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and minor facial anomalies. The incidence in the USA has been estimated to be between 0.33 and 2.2 per 1000 live births. Until the 90's, there were no objective, standardized criteria for the diagnosis of FAS. We report the case of a boy aged 5 years and 10 months who has been diagnosed as having this syndrome. The aim of this article is to review and update the criteria for the diagnosis of FAS.

N2  - The effect of 'binge' alcohol upon sphingolipid metabolism in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was examined in pregnant mice (C57BL/6J) by administering a single dose of alcohol during the third trimester (gestational day 15-16). The control mice were administered a sucrose solution of equal caloric value. Brains from progeny at postnatal days 5, 15, 21 and 30 were dissected into three regions, and sphingolipid concentrations of the brain regions were determined including assay of monoglycosylceramide, ceramide, sphingosine and sphingomyelin. We found that a single dose of ethanol induces an elevation of sphingosine (2-3.5-fold) in the brain of progeny. The level of brain ceramide at a dose of 1.5 g/kg was significantly higher than control. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy induces neuronal loss in progeny brains. Our result suggests that the elevation of sphingosine in progeny brain induced by maternal alcohol consumption may be responsible for observed neuronal loss in FAS. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Alcohol is the most common teratogen in humans. Excessive alcohol consumption in pregnant women may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, facial dysmorphology, and abnormalities in the central nervous system. Despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanisms underlying FAS remain unclear. To this end, we established a Xenopus laevis embryo model to study the effects of alcohol on fetal development. We will discuss the relationship between alcohol-induced oxidative and nitrosative stresses and their differential and critical roles in the downregulation of key developmental genes and birth defects in the X. laevis embryo model.

T1  - Effect of gestational ethanol exposure on long-term memory formation in newborn chicks
A1  - Rao V.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized by craniofacial malformations, and physical and mental retardation. It is significant that even children with history of gestational ethanol exposure but relatively unaffected overall IQ performance, often exhibit learning difficulties and behavioral problems, suggestive of impaired memory formation. Hence, the specific aim of this study was to examine memory formation in chicks exposed to ethanol during early gestation toward the understanding of neurobehavioral disturbances in FAS. Chicks were exposed to alcohol on gestational days 1-3 by injection of ethanol into the airspace of freshly fertilized eggs. The effects of prenatal ethanol on physical growth and development, and memory formation were studied. The one-trial passive avoidance learning paradigm in 1-day-old chicks was used to study memory formation in these chicks. It was observed that chick embryos exposed to 10% ethanol on gestational days 1-3 had significant reduction in all body parameters when compared with appropriate controls. Further, ethanol-exposed chick embryos had significantly impaired (P < .05) long-term memory (LTM) formation after training, though short-term or intermediate-term memory formation was unimpaired. Thus, the findings of the current study demonstrate the detrimental effects of ethanol exposure during early pregnancy on developing chick embryos in general and on memory formation in particular. Hence, it is suggested that impairment in LTM could be a fundamental mechanism for learning disorders and neurobehavioral abnormalities observed in FAS. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Unintentional injuries are a leading cause of death and disability for children. Those with developmental disabilities, including children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, are at highest risk for injuries. Although teaching safety skills is recommended to prevent injury, cognitive limitations and behavioral problems characteristic of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder make teaching these skills challenging for parents and teachers. In the current study, 32 children, ages 4-10, diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS, learned fire and street safety through computer games that employed "virtual worlds" to teach recommended safety skills. Children were pretested on verbal knowledge of four safety elements for both fire and street safety conditions and then randomly assigned to one condition. After playing the game until mastery, children were retested verbally and asked to "generalize" their newly acquired skills in a behavioral context. They were retested after 1 week follow-up. Children showed significantly better knowledge of the game to which they were exposed, immediately and at follow-up, and the majority (72%) was able to generalize all four steps within a behavioral setting. Results suggested that this is a highly effective method for teaching safety skills to high-risk children who have learning difficulties. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES. Our goals were to determine whether prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with an increased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in infancy and to compare effects of fetal alcohol exposure and iron-deficiency anemia on infant growth. We also tested whether effects of fetal alcohol exposure on growth are mediated or moderated by iron-deficiency anemia. METHODS. A total of 96 infants born to mothers from the Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, were recruited prenatally; 42 mothers drank heavily during pregnancy, and 54 abstained or drank small amounts of alcohol. Growth was assessed at birth and 6.5 and 12 months, and iron-deficiency anemia was assessed at 6.5 or 12 months. RESULTS. Infants whose mothers binge drank during pregnancy (>4 drinks per occasion) were 3.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia at 12 months than were infants whose mothers did not binge drink. Prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with reduced weight at birth, 6.5 months, and 12 months and with shorter length at 6.5 and 12 months. Iron-deficiency anemia was related to reduced 12-month weight and head circumference and to slower growth velocity between 6 and 12 months. The effects of prenatal alcohol on weight were not mediated by iron-deficiency anemia; however, they were seen primarily in infants with iron-deficiency anemia. CONCLUSIONS. The association of maternal binge drinking with an increased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia may reflect disruption of accumulation of fetal iron stores or postnatal deficiencies in iron uptake, absorption, or intake. Moreover, iron deficiency seems to exacerbate the prenatal alcohol effects on growth. Copyright © 2007 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - Cerebral hypoxia has been proposed as a mechanism by which prenatal ethanol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in children, but no study had tested this hypothesis using a chronic exposure model that mimicks a common human exposure pattern. Pregnant sheep were exposed to ethanol, 0.75 or 1.75 g kg-1 (to create blood ethanol concentrations of 85 and 185 mg dl-1, respectively), or saline 3 days per week in succession (a 'binge drinking' model) from gestational day (GD) 109 until GD 132. Fetuses were instrumented on GD 119-120 and studied on GD 132. The 1.75 g kg-1 dose resulted in a significant increase in fetal biventricular output (measured by radiolabelled microsphere technique) and heart rate, and a reduction of mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance at 1 h, the end of ethanol infusion. The arterial partial pressure of CO2 was increased, arterial pH was decreased and arterial partial pressure of O2 did not change. Fetal whole-brain blood flow increased by 37% compared with the control group at 1 h, resulting in increased cerebral oxygen delivery. The elevation in brain blood flow was region specific, occurring preferentially in the ethanol-sensitive cerebellum, increasing by 44% compared with the control group at 1 h. There were no changes in the lower dose group. Assessment of regional differences in the teratogenic effects of ethanol by stereological cell-counting technique showed a reduced number of cerebellar Purkinje cells in response to the 1.75 g kg-1 dose compared with the control brains. However, no such differences in neuronal numbers were observed in the hippocampus or the olfactory bulb. We conclude that repeated exposure to moderate doses of ethanol during the third trimester alters fetal cerebral vascular function and increases blood flow in brain regions that are vulnerable to ethanol in the presence of acidaemia and hypercapnia, and in the absence of hypoxia. © 2007 The Authors.

N2  - Objective. Review of the prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHD) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Design. We conducted a search of the Medline and Pubmed databases to identify papers reporting the association. We then searched the reference lists of the papers and reference books for additional sources. Results. We found 29 studies that met our inclusion criteria. In the 12 case series studies of subjects with FASD, the proportion of cases with a CHD (atrial [ASD] and ventricular [VSD] septal defects, other defects, or unspecified CHD) ranged from 33% to 100%. From the 14 retrospective studies, the rate of septal defects was 21%, other structural defects 6% and unspecified defects was 12%. For the 2 case-control studies, the odds of CHD ranged from 1.0 (subjects with fetal alcohol effect) to 18.0 (subjects with fetal alcohol syndrome). In the 1 prospective study of CHD the OR for a child to have CHD and FASD was 1.0. Key Conclusion. Pediatric cardiologists may have frequent contact with children with FASD and increased levels of attention to prenatal alcohol exposure as a potential etiology of CHD is indicated. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing, Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to widespread cognitive impairment and behavioral dysregulation, including deficits in attention and response inhibition. This study characterized the neural substrates underlying the disinhibited behavioral profile of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Children and adolescents (ages 8-18) with (n=13) and without (n=9) histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a response inhibition (go/no-go) task. Results: Despite similar task performance (mean response latency, performance accuracy, and signal detection), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response patterns differed by group. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that during portions of the behavioral task that required response inhibition, alcohol-exposed participants showed greater BOLD response across prefrontal cortical regions (including the left medial and right middle frontal gyri), while they showed less right caudate nucleus activation, compared with control participants. Conclusions: These data provide an account of response inhibition-related brain functioning in youth with FASD. Furthermore, results suggest that the frontal-striatal circuitry thought to mediate inhibitory control is sensitive to alcohol teratogenesis. Copyright © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

Methods: A socio-cognitive habilitative program focused on improving behavior and math functioning in children 3 to 10 years of age (n=61) was developed and evaluated. The intervention provided parental instruction on FAS, advocacy, and behavioral regulation via workshops and interactive math tutoring with children. All families received parental instruction and were then randomly assigned to either the math instruction or standard psychoeducational care groups. Results: Satisfaction with workshops was very high, with over 90% agreeing that trainers were knowledgeable and materials easy to understand and helpful. Significant gains in knowledge were found for information provided in the instructional groups. At posttesting, caregivers reported fewer problem behaviors on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, Internalizing Problem Behavior, Externalizing Problem Behavior, and Total Problem Behavior summary scales. After 5 months, both groups of children demonstrated gains in math knowledge but significantly higher gains were found in the group receiving direct math instruction. The math treatment group was also more likely to demonstrate a gain of over 1 standard deviation on any of the 4 math outcome measures used. Conclusions: These findings suggest that parents of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FAS(D)) benefit from instruction in understanding their child's alcohol-related neurological damage and strategies to provide positive behavioral supports and that targeted psychoeducational programs may be able to remediate some of the math deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a severe outcome of alcohol use during pregnancy, and the rates may be higher in countries with greater use of alcohol. To obtain information from Russian physicians (N = 23), women (N = 23), and male partners (N = 5), focus groups were conducted with 51 participants in St. Petersburg, Russia. The main objective was to determine the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior related to drinking during pregnancy. Data were analyzed using ATLAS-ti 5.0. The results will be used to develop a survey of Russian professionals and women leading to FAS prevention programming. The study's limitations are described. Copyright © 2007 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - The subject of this literature review is the fetal alcohol syndrome (F.A.S.). It will describe the effects that the ingestion of large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy, have upon the developing fetus from a physiological perspective. Alcohol is a potent teratogen in humans, and prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The physiological problems encountered by the neonate, who has been exposed to high levels of in utero alcohol, necessitating admission to the neonatal unit, will be addressed. As the neonatal unit delivers a holistic approach to care this review will also describe the psychological and sociological effects of F.A.S. on the newborn infants and their families. It will also aim to discuss how these factors influence the planning and management of care delivered to the neonate who has F.A.S., whilst being nursed on the neonatal unit. ©Pharmakon-Press.

N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can produce an array of birth defects comprising fetal alcohol syndrome. A hallmark of fetal alcohol syndrome is intrauterine growth retardation, which is associated with elevated apoptosis of placental cytotrophoblast cells. Using a human first trimester cytotrophoblast cell line, we examined the relationship between exposure to ethanol and cytotrophoblast survival, as well as the ameliorating effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors produced by human cytotrophoblast cells. After exposure to 0-100 mM ethanol, cell death was quantified by the TUNEL method, and expression of the nuclear proliferation marker, Ki67, was measured by immunohistochemistry. The mode of cell death was determined by assessing annexin V binding, caspase 3 activation, pyknotic nuclear morphology, reduction of TUNEL by caspase inhibition, and cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase. Ethanol significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death approximately 2.5-fold through the apoptotic pathway within 1-2 h of exposure to 50 mM alcohol. Exposure to 25-50 mM ethanol significantly increased transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF), but not EGF or amphiregulin (AREG). When cytotrophoblasts were exposed concurrently to 100 mM ethanol and 1 nM HBEGF or TGFA, the increase in apoptosis was prevented, while EGF ameliorated at 10 nM and AREG was weakly effective. HBEGF survival-promoting activity required ligation of either of its cognate receptors, HER1 or HER4. These findings reveal the potential for ethanol to rapidly induce cytotrophoblast apoptosis. However, survival factor induction could provide cytotrophoblasts with an endogenous cytoprotective mechanism. © 2007 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure may adversely affect fetal development, causing growth restriction, distinctive craniofacial anomalies, and central nervous system dysfunction. The continuum of associated adverse fetal outcomes is most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The purpose of this study was to further clarify the relationship between dysmorphic features and general cognitive capacity in a study on Finnish children with FASD. Forty-eight 8- to 16-year-old children with FASD underwent a dysmorphology examination and an assessment of cognitive capacity. Dysmorphic features and growth deficiency were quantified by assigning each child a total dysmorphology score (TDS). Six subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) were used for assessment of general cognitive capacity. Our results show a significant correlation between the TDS and cognitive capacity was found, suggesting that children with more severe growth deficiency and dysmorphic features have more cognitive limitations. Birth measures of length and weight correlated with general cognitive capacity. Head circumference correlated only with Performance IQ. These findings imply an inverse relationship between growth deficiency/dysmorphic features and cognitive function in children with FASD. Although the correlations are significant, the data suggest that in individual cases, the TDS cannot reliably predict cognitive function in later life. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Alcohol use during pregnancy can result in a continuum of effects including growth deficits, dysmorphology and/or complex patterns of behavioural and cognitive difficulties that influence an individual's functioning throughout their lifespan. We conducted a systematic review to identify research-based interventions for children and youth with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and areas for future study. Methods: We identified the substantive literature by searching 40 peer-reviewed and 23 grey literature databases, as well as reference lists. We hand-searched eight relevant journals, and undertook a systematic search of Internet sites and review of reports and documents received from key stakeholders. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Given the small number of studies that met all inclusion criteria, both experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included. Results: Ten intervention studies were identified, of which three were experimental or quasi-experimental, and four were non-experimental. Despite multiple attempts, three studies (two in foreign languages and one unpublished) could not be acquired. A meta-analysis could not be undertaken because the included studies examined different interventions or outcomes. Interventions targeted in the included studies were as follows: (i) psychostimulant medications (methyphenidate, pemoline and dextroamphetamine); and (ii) Cognitive Control Therapy. The identified studies were limited by very small sample sizes and weak designs. Conclusion: There is limited scientific evidence upon which to draw recommendations regarding efficacious interventions for children and youth with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Clinicians, researchers, service providers, educators, policy makers, affected children and youth and their families, and others need to urgently collaborate to develop a comprehensive research agenda for this population. © 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - * It is well accepted that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, but research findings for exposure to low to moderate alcohol levels during pregnancy are equivocal, allowing a range of interpretations. * The 2001 guideline from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for low-risk drinking for "women who are pregnant or might soon become pregnant" recommends fewer than seven standard drinks per week, and no more than two standard drinks on any one day. This position has polarised health professional and consumer opinion in Australia. * The NHMRC guidelines on alcohol are scheduled for review in 2007. We surveyed the alcohol and pregnancy policies and clinical practice guidelines of Australia and six other English-speaking countries to identify current policy. Documents were obtained through Internet searches and direct contact with the relevant organisations. * The policies and guidelines varied both across and within countries, and the NHMRC guideline, while not universally supported in Australia, is in step with the policies of the United Kingdom and Canada. * Research is needed to elucidate the true association between low to moderate alcohol consumption and fetal harm, the impact of different policies on rates of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and any untoward outcomes of an abstinence message, to inform and underpin future policy development in Australia.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Alcohol abuse produces damaging effects on the CNS that leads to several types of disorders. When consumed during pregnancy, alcohol may cause craniofacial malformations, growth retardation and brain damage in offspring. These symptoms are grouped by the term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is the most common cause of non-genetic mental retardation in the western world. Substantial efforts to elucidate the molecular basis of these impairments are currently in progress. Whereas FAS is totally preventable by avoiding alcohol intake during pregnancy, efficient therapies to prevent or mitigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are still not available but many pharmacological treatments have been developed to avoid alcohol intake and dependence in adults. The present article reviews the most relevant mechanisms of alcohol injury in developing brain and the strategies and patents that are currently available and in progress to prevent therapy for FAS. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

There is thus a need for laboratory markers for early detection of alcohol-exposed neonates. The aim of our study was to assess the efficiency of the usual alcohol biomarkers measured in cord blood to identify alcohol-exposed neonates immediately after birth. Methods: A 1-year study was conducted in the labor wards of the maternity units of the Auvergne, Central France at the time of term delivery. The patients answered an anonymous self-completion survey concerning alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test; AUDIT) during their pregnancy. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and -glutamyltransferase concentrations and the percentage of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were measured in maternal and cord blood. Results: We collected 870 maternal-fetal sample pairs. Two cases (0.2%) of typical FASD were detected. We report a non-significant correlation between maternal and cord blood biomarkers. None of the cord blood biomarkers differed significantly between newborns of alcohol-exposed and unexposed mothers. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the usual alcohol biomarkers are not effective in cord blood for identifying alcohol-exposed neonates. ©2007 by Walter de Gruyter.

N2  - Objectives: The prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) were determined in a third primary school cohort in a community in South Africa (SA). Methods: An active case ascertainment, two-tier screening methodology, and the revised Institute of Medicine diagnostic criteria were employed among 818 first grade pupils. Characteristics of children with FAS and PFAS are contrasted with a randomly selected control group. Data were collected and analyzed for children in the study regarding: (1) physical growth and development, including dysmorphology, (2) intelligence and behavioral characteristics, and (3) their mother's social, behavioral, and physical characteristics. Results: The rate of FAS and PFAS in this area continues as the highest reported in any overall community and is much higher than rates elsewhere. In this cohort it is 68.0-89.2 per 1000. Severe episodic drinking on weekends among mothers of children with FAS and PFAS accounts for 96% of all alcohol consumed. Various measures of maternal drinking are significantly correlated with negative outcomes of children in the areas of non-verbal intelligence (-0.26), verbal intelligence (-0.28), problem behavior (0.31), and overall dysmorphology score (0.59). Significantly more FAS and PFAS exists among children of rural residents (OR = 3.79). Conclusions: A high rate of FAS and PFAS was again documented in this community, and it has increased. Given population similarities, we suspect that other communities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa also have high rates. Programs for prevention are needed. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. This study compared the prevalence of psychopathological conditions in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (N = 39) and nonexposed, typically developing peers (N = 30), matched with respect to age, gender, and socioeconomic status. METHODS. Caregivers were interviewed with either the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime Version, or the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version IV. Statistical resampling methods were used to create 95% confidence intervals for the difference between the proportions of children with psychopathological conditions in the exposed and control groups. RESULTS. Group differences were seen in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depressive disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and specific phobia outcome categories. The group difference in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder category was by far the largest effect observed. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that fetal alcohol exposure should be considered a possible factor in the pathogenesis of childhood psychiatric disorders. These data provide clinically relevant information about the mental health problems that children with fetal alcohol exposure are likely to face.

N2  - Objective: To establish the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in Victoria through the Victorian Birth Defects Register (VBDR). Methods: A sample of live births from 1995-2002 was selected from the Victorian Perinatal Data Collection and VBDR based on reported microcephaly, FAS or maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy. Following ethics approval, medical records of mother and child were requested for 117 births. One hundred and nine of these were accessed and examined for factors related to FAS. Records were categorised as FAS, possible FAS, unable to categorise, or not FAS. Results: From the VBDR the prevalence was calculated at 0.006 per 1,000 live births. Four additional possible cases of FAS increased this to 0.014 per 1,000 live births. Six cases were defined as 'unable to categorise'as alcohol use was unknown but other features of FAS were evident. Including these cases, plus five where some low-level alcohol use was reported, increased the prevalence to 0.03 per 1,000 live births. Twenty-eight per cent of the audit population and 39% of the microcephalic cases had no information about maternal alcohol use recorded in the antenatal or babies'records. Conclusion and Implications: The audit of medical records provided additional information regarding FAS prevalence in Victoria. This prevalence ranges from 0.01 to 0.03 per 1,000 live births. To accurately assess the extent of the problem, there needs to be improved reporting of alcohol use in pregnancy and a system in place to report cases diagnosed during and beyond the perinatal period to the VBDR.

N2  - Alcohol is detrimental to the developing brain and remains the leading cause of mental retardation in developed countries. The mechanism of alcohol brain damage remains elusive. Studies of neurological problems in adults have focused on alcohol's cerebrovascular effects, because alcoholism is a major risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular injuries. However, few studies have examined similar cerebrovascular effects of fetal alcohol exposure. We examined the effect of chronic binge alcohol exposure during the second trimester on fetal cerebrovascular and metabolic responses to hypoxia in near-term sheep and tested the hypothesis that fetal alcohol exposure would attenuate cerebrovascular dilation to hypoxia. Pregnant ewes were infused with alcohol (1.5 g/kg) or saline intravenously at 60-90 days of gestation (full term = 150 days). At 125 days of gestation, we measured fetal cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism at baseline and during hypoxia. Maternal blood alcohol averaged 214 +/- 5.9 mg/dl immediately after the 1.5-h infusion, with similar values throughout the month of infusion. Hypoxia resulted in a robust increase in CBF in saline-infused fetuses. However, the CBF response to hypoxia in fetuses chronically exposed to alcohol was significantly attenuated. Cerebral oxygen delivery decreased in both groups of fetuses during hypoxia but to a greater degree in the alcohol-exposed fetuses. Prenatal alcohol exposure during the second trimester attenuates cerebrovascular responses to hypoxia in the third trimester. Altered cerebrovascular reactivity might be one mechanism for alcohol-related brain damage and might set the stage for further brain injury if a hypoxic insult occurs.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects 1 in 100 births in the United States and results in craniofacial dysmorphologic condition and learning disabilities. In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroprotective peptides prevented fetal death and learning deficits. The -aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor subunit GABAbeta3 plays a critical role for nervous system and palate development. Our objective was to determine whether the neuropeptides prevented alcohol-induced damage through GABAbeta3. Study design: With a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, timed pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol) or control (saline solution) or alcohol plus peptides NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (NAP + SAL; 20 mug). Embryos were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days after treatment. Adult males were tested for learning on the Morris water maze, and their brains were dissected. With samples from at least 3 litters per time point, calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for GABAbeta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher protected least significant difference. Results: Twenty-four hours and 10 days after treatment, alcohol decreased GABAbeta3 in the embryos (P < .01); this decrease was prevented by the peptides (P = .01). GABAbeta3 was higher in alcohol treated adult brains respect to the controls (P = .002); this rise was not prevented by the peptides. Conclusion: Treatment with the neuropeptides NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA prevented the alcohol-induced decline in GABAbeta3 expression 10 days after alcohol exposure. Because palate formation continues through E18, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA may be beneficial for the prevention of cleft lip and palate. © 2007 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most devastating. Recognized by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities and growth deficiency, this condition produces severe alcohol-induced damage in the developing brain. FAS children experience ataxia; deficits in intellectual functioning; and difficulties in learning, memory, problem solving, and attention. Multiple aspects of central nervous system development can be affected by alcohol exposure, but the most striking abnormalities are neuronal and glial migration. Little is known about cellular mechanisms by which alcohol affects the migration of immature neurons. Recently, it has been found that Ca2+ signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of the action of alcohol in neuronal cell migration. Most importantly, the aberrant migration of immature neurons caused by alcohol exposure is significantly ameliorated by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways. In this Mini-Review, we first describe how alcohol exposure impairs the migration of cerebellar granule cells and then discuss the signaling mechanisms involved. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in a spectrum of adverse developmental outcomes in offspring, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Deficits in executive function - the psychological processes involved in controlling voluntary goal-oriented behavior - are prevalent in FASD. Oculomotor tasks have been designed as highly sensitive tools to evaluate components of executive function. Because of the extensive overlap in the brain areas controlling eye movements and those affected in FASD, we hypothesized that individuals with FASD display specific neurobehavioral abnormalities that can be quantified with eye movement testing. Methods: Subjects (8-12 years old) were instructed to look either toward (prosaccade) or away from (antisaccade) a stimulus that appeared in the peripheral visual field. Two fixation conditions were used. In the gap condition, the central fixation point (FP) was removed before the appearance of the peripheral stimulus; in the overlap condition, the FP remained illuminated. Saccadic reaction times (SRTs, time from stimulus appearance to saccade initiation), direction errors (saccades made in the incorrect direction relative to instruction), and express saccades (short-latency: SRT=90-140 ms) were measured to assess automatic and volitional saccade control. Results: Compared with controls, FASD children had elongated reaction times, excessive direction errors, and no express saccades. Metric analysis of correct prosaccades revealed a trend toward increased saccadic duration and decreased saccadic velocity in FASD subjects. Conclusion: These results reflect deficits in executive function and motor control, and are consistent with dysfunction of the frontal lobes, possibly due to disrupted inhibitory mechanisms. Therefore, eye movement tasks may be powerful and easy tools for assessing executive function deficits in FASD. Copyright © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - In Italy, little is known about the spectrum of adverse fetal effects related to maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. In this paper, we report on the phenotype of Italian children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These data were gathered as part of a field study assessing the prevalence of FASD in children in an in-school study in a rural area near Rome. The purposes of this paper are: (1) to completely characterize the clinical phenotype of a large cohort of Italian children with FASD; (2) to correlate and contrast the phenotype of this population with that observed in other populations and reported in the medical literature; (3) to discuss the drinking habits of Italian women, before, during and after pregnancy; and (4) to suggest mechanisms for intervention and prevention of FASD based on data gathered from this study. © 2006.

N2  - Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure causes permanent structural alterations to the brain and can lead to numerous cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Consistent with many of the neuropsychological and behavioral deficits that have been reported, neuroimaging studies reveal a pattern of structural abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This chapter systematically reviews structural anomalies by brain region, identifying cognitive and behavioral correlates when relevant. The consensus shows that in addition to the overall reduction of brain size, prominent brain shape abnormalities have been observed, with narrowing in the parietal region and reduced brain growth in portions of the frontal lobe. Commensurating with these anomalies, volumetric and tissue density findings cite disproportionate reductions in the parietal lobe, cerebellar vermis, corpus callosum, and the caudate nucleus, suggesting that certain areas of the brain may be especially vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure. In sum, neuroimaging techniques have greatly advanced our understanding of brain-behavior relationships in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and hopefully will lead to improved diagnosis and treatment options for those affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the most severe manifestation of the adverse effects of alcohol on foetal development, was first described in the French medical literature by Lemoine et al. in 1968 [Les Gfants des parents alcholiques: anomalies observes a propos de 127 cas (The children of alchoholic parents: anomalies observed in 127 cases). Quert in Medicine 8, 476-482]. Five years later, Jones et al., 1973. Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic alcholic mothers. Lancet 1, 1129-1267] were the first to delineate systematically the association between maternal alcohol abuse and a specific pattern of birth defects and to provide diagnostic criteria for this condition. Several diagnostic systems have since been developed with a view to capturing the wide spectrum of physical and behavioral anomalies resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. The purpose of the current paper is to outline the evolution of FAS as a medical diagnosis. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Defining the behavioral phenotype in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A review
A1  - Kodituwakku P.W.
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - While there exists a large body of literature on cognitive functions in children with prenatal alcohol exposure, it remains undetermined if these children exhibit a unique profile of cognitive-behavioral functioning or a behavioral phenotype. Researchers have consistently found that intellectual functioning, as assessed by IQ tests, of children with prenatal alcohol exposure is deficient. There is increasing evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with slow information processing and attentional problems, in particular inattentiveness. Studies examining specific cognitive abilities such as language, visual perception, and memory in alcohol-affected children have shown performance decrements associated with increased task complexity. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure have also been found to exhibit significant deficits in daily functional skills or adaptive behavior, with deficits in socialization becoming pronounced during adolescence. The above findings point to the conclusion that a generalized deficit in complex information processing constitutes the central cognitive-behavioral characteristic of children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Researchers have consistently documented that specific brain regions are more affected by alcohol than other regions. The problem of mapping focal anomalies of the brain with a generalized pattern of deficits can be solved by taking developmental processes into consideration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A practical clinical approach to diagnosis
A1  - Manning M.A.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - In utero exposure to alcohol can have numerous adverse effects on a developing fetus. These effects represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities that have recently been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Children at the most severe end of this spectrum and displaying the complete phenotype of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system are defined as having fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). While FAS is the most readily clinically recognized form of FASD, other categories within the continuum of adverse effects due to prenatal alcohol exposure are becoming better defined. These include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). As more is learned regarding the exact manifestations of alcohol on brain development, these classifications may be expanded and/or refined. Because FASD represents a major public health concern, early recognition of at-risk children is important for initiating interventional strategies. Thus, the purpose of this report is to educate practicing physicians about the recognizable phenotypes of FASD in order to accurately identify these children and implement the most appropriate management plans. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have numerous adverse growth, structural and neurodevelopmental consequences for the developing fetus. This spectrum of disabilities has been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The most severe condition in this continuum of disability is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by a distinctive pattern of facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system that often include mental retardation. Children with FASD who manifest some, but not all, of the features of FAS can be further categorized as having partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Specific structural birth defects (e.g. malformations of the heart, kidneys and/or musculoskeletal system) are the hallmark of ARBD in a child with normal growth and development; whereas, ARND comprises a specific pattern of disordered behavior and development among alcohol exposed children with normal growth and structural development. In addiction medicine, some evidence indicates that prenatal alcohol exposure can increase the risk for behavioral disorders, including depression and negative self-esteem in the offspring of alcoholic women. Furthermore, prenatal alcohol exposure may result in long-term neurocognitive disorders involving problems with executive functioning, higher level language deficits and behavioral disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize what recently has been reported regarding specific criteria for defining and diagnosing the conditions within the overarching term FASD. Such criteria allow the continuum of FASD to be more readily diagnosed by practicing pediatricians, thereby leading to earlier intervention and amelioration of related medical and behavioral disorders.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health problem and is an established cause of serious birth defects and developmental delay collectively described as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is caused by congenital alcohol-induced damages and is a cause of mental retardation. It is characterised by facial abnormalities and growth deficiency. Infants affected by the syndrome show intellectual impairment, and difficulties in learning, memory, problem-solving, and attention as well as experiencing additional problems with mental health and social interactions. However, an absence of the characteristic facial defects and growth deficiency may result in a failure to identify children with prenatal alcohol exposure, which can further present as alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorder (ARND) or alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Estimates of prevalence of FAS in U.S.A. range between 0.3 to 2.2 per 1,000 live births, but much higher rates occurring in some communities. Harmonisation of the methodology used for epidemiological studies, with research activities that establishes real baseline prevalence of FAS and identification of women who are at highest risk of bearing a FAS-affected child, are an essential prerequisite to prevention. In addition, it is essential to assess different FAS preventive approaches through carefully controlled studies. Universal, selected, and indicated preventive strategies have been identified, targeting different kind of populations. Since FAS and other adverse effects of drinking during pregnancy are theoretically completely preventable, it is vital to make more efforts to improve the application of the most appropriate interventions. Although in Italy alcohol consumption has constantly increased, mainly amongst the young (including women of childbearing age), knowledge on FAS and alcohol-related effects is completely lacking. Because of the high cost for care of individuals with this syndrome, it is essential to apply appropriate interventions to prevent this problem.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD) is one of the most preventable sources of developmental abnormalities, and has a singular cause-alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Estimates for the costs of treatment of a single case of FASD range often above one million dollars. The primary strategy for prevention currently centers on no alcohol consumption during pregnancy. However, a sizeable number of North American women currently drink during pregnancy. A literature review examined the behavior of maternal alcohol consumption in order to understand the rationale associated with drinking. Generally, it appears that pregnant women differ by their alcohol consumption habits and their reasons to drink. In an attempt to eliminate FASD, we review a number of educational, legal, and community-based programs that have been used to promote abstinence and examine where they have been successful. Unfortunately, social marketing strategies have received less attention. Several potential applications of social marketing directed to drinkingduring- pregnancy campaigns are suggested, and possible contributions to the overall effort are explained.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) consists of multi-system abnormalities and is caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of alcohol on the human foetus has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and FAS is the most important human teratogenic condition known today. The purpose of this study was to analyse the craniofacial parameters of children with FAS and compare them with matched controls. Ninety children diagnosed with FAS (45 males, 45 females) and 90 controls were matched for age, gender, and social class. The mean age of the FAS children was 8.9 years with the controls slightly older at 9.1 years. This age difference was not significant (P = 0.34). A standard lateral cephalometric radiograph of each subject was taken. The radiographs were digitized for 20 linear and 17 angular measurements. These 37 variables were formulated to assess the size, shape, and relative position of three craniofacial complexes: (1) the cranial base, (2) midface, and (3) mandible. In addition, nine variables were computed to compare the soft tissue profiles. The study showed that measurements related to face height and mandibular size appear to be the most important features when distinguishing FAS children. Overall, the FAS children in the present study presented with vertically and horizontally underdeveloped maxillae, together with features of long face syndrome with large gonial angles and a short ramus in relation to total face height. There was also a tendency for the development of an anterior open bite, which appears to be compensated for by an increase in the vertical dimension of the anterior alveolar process to bring the incisor teeth into occlusion. The latter adaptation occurred mainly in the mandible. © The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Orthodontics Society. All rights reserved.

N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) consists of multisystem abnormalities and is caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of alcohol on the human foetus has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and FAS is one of the most important human teratogenic conditions known today. The purpose of this study was to assess the dental age (DA) and skeletal age (SA) of children with FAS and compare them with matched controls. The samples of 90 children diagnosed with FAS and 90 controls were matched for age, gender, and social class. The mean chronological age (CA) of the FAS subjects was 8.95 years, with the controls slightly older at 9.04 years. This difference was not significant. Dental maturity was determined by assessing the stage of tooth formation and SA assessment was made from hand-wrist radiographs for the patients and controls by assigning a SA and comparing it with standard plates. The means and standard deviations of CA and DA for the stages of calcification were calculated and the Pearson ranked order correlation coefficient was applied to measure the associations between skeletal maturity indicators and DA. t-tests were used to test for group differences between independent groups, and paired t-tests to determine paired group differences. This study provided evidence of a positive association between DA and SA in both the FAS children and the controls. The data suggest that both DA and SA may be a reflection of general somatic growth. It must be acknowledged that growth of individuals is often irregular, when any norms of development based on central tendencies and variabilities of healthy children are applied. Some aspects of growth and development for healthy children may show a variable pattern of growth. Therefore, correlation of these aspects of growth and development will often not show the degree of correlation that theoretically exists between different areas of growth and development. A more complete appraisal of the entire skeleton and an evaluation of the entire dentition, rather than just the mandibular teeth, might improve the correlation between the variables. © The Author 2006.

T1  - Detection of in vivo DNA damage induced by ethanol in multiple organs of pregnant mice using the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay

N2  - Ethanol is principal ingredient of alcohol beverage, but considered as human carcinogen, and has neurotoxicity. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy often causes fetal alcohol syndrome. The DNA damage is one of the important factors in carcinogenicity or teratogenicity. To detect the DNA damage induced by ethanol, we used an in vivo alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay in pregnant mice organs and embryos. Pregnant ICR mice on Day 7 of gestation were treated with 2, 4 or 8 g/kg ethanol, and maternal organs/tissues and embryos were subjected to the Comet assay at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr after ethanol treatment. Four and 8 g/kg ethanol induced DNA damage in brain, lung and embryos at 4 or 8 hr after the treatment. Two g/kg ethanol did not cause any DNA damage, and 8 g/kg ethanol only increased the duration of DNA damage without distinct increase in the degree of the damage. No significant DNA damage was observed in the liver. To detect the effect of acetaldehyde, disulfiram, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, was administered before 4 g/kg ethanol treatment. No significant increase of DNA damage was observed in the disulfiram pre-treated group. These data indicate that ethanol induces DNA damage, which might be related to ethanol toxicity. Since pre-treatment of disulfiram did not increase DNA damage, DNA damage observed in this study might not be the effect of acetaldehyde.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Objective and methods: To explore association between prevalence of ADHD and levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure, the authors reviewed the charts of 2,231 youth referred for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Participants were categorized into four groups by different levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure. For each group, the prevalence rates of ADHD and other selected disorders were determined. Results: The disorder ranking first in overall prevalence was ADHD (41%), followed by learning disorder (17%) and oppositional-defiant/conduct disorder (16%). Prevalence rates of ADHD across the groups generally were high risk > some risk > unknown risk > no risk. Conclusion: The frequency distribution of ADHD cases was according to the levels of risk for gestational alcohol exposure. These results add to a growing body of evidence supporting an association between ADHD and prenatal alcohol exposure. Findings need to be confirmed by definitive studies on ADHD and gestational alcohol exposure. © 2006 Sage Publications.

T1  - Comparison of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and the hoyme diagnostic guidelines for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
A1  - Astley S.J.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - OBJECTIVE. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and the Hoyme fetal alcohol spectrum disorders diagnostic guidelines differ markedly. The performances of the 2 diagnostic systems were compared. METHODS. The fetal alcohol syndrome diagnostic criteria from the 4-Digit Code and Hoyme guidelines were applied to 952 patients who had received an interdisciplinary, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, diagnostic evaluation at the University of Washington with the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and 16 children with confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure. RESULTS. The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome was 3.7% with the 4-Digit Code and 4.1% with the Hoyme guidelines. Although the prevalences were similar, the patients identified were not. Only 17 individuals met the fetal alcohol syndrome criteria for both systems. An extraordinary number of patients (35%) met the Hoyme criteria for the fetal alcohol syndrome facial phenotype, but only 39 of those 330 patients met the Hoyme criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome. Even some children with no alcohol exposure (25%) had the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome face. The specificities of the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome face for the Hoyme fetal alcohol syndrome diagnosis and prenatal alcohol exposure were low in these populations. CONCLUSIONS. Without a specific facial phenotype, a valid diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome cannot be rendered for patients with prenatal alcohol exposure, because a causal link between their outcomes and exposure cannot be established, and a valid diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome cannot be rendered for patients with unknown alcohol exposure, because the face cannot serve as a valid proxy measure for alcohol exposure. Diagnostic guidelines must confirm the specificity of their fetal alcohol syndrome facial criteria to validate their diagnostic criteria. Copyright © 2006 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

T1  - Myelin degeneration in peripheral nerve in chick embryos following continuous ethanol exposure during early gestational period: A preliminary report
A1  - Chaudhuri J.D.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized among other features by motor and sensory derangements and neurobehavioral deficits. However, no specific changes in the brain and spinal cord that could conclusively explain these neuronal defects have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of continuous ethanol exposure during early gestation on the peripheral nerve, towards the understanding of neuronal disorders in FAS. A chick model of FAS was used and embryos were exposed to 5%, 10% and 15% ethanol on embryonic days 1-8. The effects on general growth and development, and on the peripheral nerve of ethanol-exposed embryos were examined following the full period of gestation. There was significant reduction in crown rump length, head circumference and body weight in ethanol exposed chicks when compared with appropriate control groups. The growth retardation among the different alcohol exposed groups was dose dependent and prenatal mortality of embryos was seen in embryos exposed to 10% and 15% ethanol. Features of myclin degeneration were observed in the peripheral nerve in majority of chick embryos exposed to 10% and 15% ethanol as compared to embryos exposed to 5% ethanol as well as in the control groups. Thus, this study demonstrates the dose dependent effects of continuous prenatal ethanol exposure in a chick model of FAS. More significantly, it demonstrates the detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing peripheral nerve.

N2  - Background: Peer relationship problems are a significant part of the clinical presentation of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Many of these children have been prescribed psychotropic medications by community practitioners. The present study reports on the interaction between medication status and parent and teacher-reported outcomes for parent-assisted Children's Friendship Training (CFT). Methods: Seventy seven children (40 boys and 37 girls, age range was 71-139 months) diagnosed with FASD were given 12 sessions of CFT. Parent- and teacher-reported social outcomes were compared across four subgroups of children who were prescribed either stimulant or neuroleptic medication, neither or both types of medications. Results: According to parent and teacher reports, children prescribed neuroleptic medication showed greater improvement on all outcome measures when compared to children not prescribed neuroleptics. In contrast, children prescribed stimulant medication either failed to show improvement or showed poorer outcomes when compared to children not prescribed stimulants. Implications: Children with FASD frequently present with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. The present results suggest physicians routinely ask about prenatal alcohol exposure as part of history taking to treat children more effectively who appear to be displaying attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptomatology but who may have FASD.

N2  - Typically, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are not diagnosed in children until developmental problems become apparent. To diagnose these children earlier would benefit both them and their caregivers. Neonatal cranial ultrasound has great potential diagnostic utility in the presence of known heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, in that it allows us to gather critical neuroanatomical information before the fontanel closes. This report describes the case of Baby S, in which the neonatal ultrasound was crucial in obtaining early fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) diagnosis and facilitating an array of interventions for which the baby would not otherwise have been eligible. Now four years old, Baby S has received care in many different forms, and is making substantial progress. The early FAS diagnosis and subsequent interventions may have ameliorated, and continue to ameliorate, the poor developmental prognosis for many individuals with FASD.

T1  - Alcohol consumption in the new millennium - Weighing up the risks and benefits for our health
A1  - Foster R.K.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Alcohol is produced via the anaerobic fermentation of sugars by yeast and involves glucose molecules (C6H12O6) being broken down to yield ethanol (C2H5OH), carbon dioxide (CO5) and energy. The amount of alcohol contained in different alcoholic beverages varies considerably and is referred to as the 'strength' of the drink, which is expressed as the percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV). A standard unit of alcohol in the UK equates to 8g or 10ml of pure alcohol. Guidelines for sensible drinking set by the UK government are 3-4 units (24-32g) a day or less for men, and 2-3 units (16-24g) a day or less for women. Specific recommendations have been set for those planning pregnancy and pregnant women, who should drink no more than 1-2 units of alcohol once or twice a week and should avoid heavy drinking sessions. Guidelines for sensible drinking are similar in other countries. When taking into account the standard drink unit used to define guidelines, the most commonly recommended limit is 24g/day for men and 20g/day for women. Older people are more likely to drink in line with the sensible drinking guidelines, as they tend to consume alcohol over a period of time, as opposed to consuming large quantities on one or two days of the week, a practice that is more popular among younger people. Consuming double the sensible drinking guidelines in one day is classified as binge drinking (an alternative definition is drinking until intoxicated). It has become recognised that binge drinking is a common phenomenon in the UK, particularly among younger people. Other factors, such as income, ethnicity and region of residence, are also recognised to be predictive of the quantity of alcohol consumed; for example, higher-income households are more likely to consume large quantities of alcohol and consume alcohol more frequently. The quantity of alcohol consumed is an important factor in determining how it affects health and well-being. In terms of nutritional health, chronic excessive alcohol intake is well recognised to affect an individual's nutrient status, because it reduces food intake and/or may interfere with the digestion, absorption, metabolism and utilisation of some nutrients. However, when consumed in moderation, alcohol is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of nutrients or be associated with impaired vitamin function or depletion to an extent that may harm health, provided that dietary intakes are adequate. Alcoholic beverages contain alcohol, carbohydrate and only small amounts of some vitamins, trace elements and minerals. They are therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to micronutrient intake. Any association that exists between moderate alcohol consumption and the absorption and metabolism of nutrients from the diet is dependant on a number of factors, including: the nutrient in question; habitual intake of the nutrient and the nutritional status of the individual; and the quantity of alcohol consumed over a period of time. Overall, little information exists about the implications of binge drinking on nutrient status; but it may alter food intake, and excessive alcohol consumption can cause disturbances to the digestive system. While infrequent binge drinking is unlikely to have any long-term nutritional implications (although it may affect nutrient status in the short-term), regular binge drinking may have a more negative impact. Although alcoholic beverages tend to have few nutrients, they can be a significant source of energy, as alcohol provides 7kcal per gram. Studies indicate that alcoholic beverages are usually additive to an individual's normal energy intake and individuals are unlikely to compensate for energy from them during the day. The aperitif effect of alcohol may also encourage an increase in energy intake. It is therefore not surprising that alcohol intake has been associated with weight gain and an increase in body mass index (BMI) (with the exception of chronic excessive drinkers). However, there are a number of methodological problems that need to be considered when comparing the findings of studies investigating the association between alcohol intake and disease risk, including: potential misreporting of total intake; the use of an appropriate control group; and the need for comparable measurement units. Consumption of alcoholic beverages has also been associated with increasing the risk of ill-health associated with pre-existing conditions. For example, it may contribute to ulcer development or aggravate symptoms of existing ulcers. There is evidence that moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy may affect the development of the fetus's central nervous system, and may result in low birthweight. However, there is currently no consensus as to whether alcohol should be completely avoided during pregnancy. However, it is well recognised that excess alcohol consumption during pregnancy can put the fetus at risk of fetal alcohol syndrome. Quantity of alcohol consumed is particularly important when considering the association between alcohol and chronic diseases; for example, there is now strong evidence that light to moderate (1-3 drinks per day) consumption decreases the risk of a coronary heart disease (CHD) episode compared with abstainers (with particular benefits in men aged over 55years and post-menopausal women). However, heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of CHD. Further information is required to determine the association between drinking patterns and heart health. However, there is a consensus of opinion that it is the alcohol per se that influences heart health, rather than a particular type of alcoholic beverage; and other factors that affect an individual's choice of drink may be important in distorting the findings from studies that show otherwise. As with risk of CHD, light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk (of 30-40%) of type 2 diabetes, when compared with teetotallers. Heavy drinking may be associated with an increased risk, resulting in a 'J' or 'U' shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. A 'J' shaped relationship has also been reported between alcohol consumption and blood pressure. It is widely accepted that heavy alcohol intake is a risk factor for high blood pressure, and evidence indicates that moderate intakes may exert a short-term lowering effect, while abstainers/teetotallers are reported to have a higher blood pressure. The type of stroke is important when considering the association between stroke and alcohol, as any alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke, but low intakes (i.e. one drink per day) may have a protective effect on ischaemic stroke. Heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of both types of stroke. Alcohol intake has also been associated with an increased risk of cancers at a number of sites. However, a consensus for a likely causal association has only been identified between alcohol and cancers of the upper-aero digestive tract and liver. The mechanisms to explain the positive associations between alcohol and breast cancer, and alcohol and colorectal cancer, have yet to be identified. It is unclear whether some types of alcoholic beverage are more strongly associated with increased risk of cancer than others. Mechanisms identified to date suggest that it is the alcohol per se that exerts damage and, therefore, quantity of alcohol consumed is the most important variable. Studies looking at the relationship between alcohol and mortality suggest that 10-80g (approximately 1-8 drinks) of alcohol each week is optimal to reap the health benefits, but increased risk is noted at higher intakes (thus indicating a 'U' shaped relationship between alcohol intake and mortality). Gender and age are important factors when considering the association between alcohol and mortality. For example, for younger people, the benefits of alcohol may be outweighed by the increased risk of other diseases (e.g. alcohol-related cancers, liver cirrhosis) and increased risk of violence and accidents. Aggressive behaviour, increased risk taking and decreased responsiveness to social expectations, which may lead to personal 'harm', including accidents and violence, are usually the result of alcohol intoxication (i.e. through binge drinking). Excess alcohol consumption may also result in a 'hangover', which disrupts normal life through symptoms of fatigue and increased anxiety, and has economic consequences in the workplace through poor performance or absenteeism. The extent to which a hangover can affect an individual's performance, including psychomotor, recognition and managerial skills, is still being debated. Binge drinking is also associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies. Although the cost of binge drinking in terms of long-term health has yet to be established, the significant economic cost is well recognised. A number of population-based initiatives are underway to try and change the 'drinking culture', and thus reduce the incidence of binge drinking. Initiatives include: advertising campaigns; changes to alcohol advertising regulations; and changes to pub licensing regulations. © 2006 British Nutrition Foundation.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects brain structure and function. This study examined brain metabolism using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and searched for regions of specific vulnerability in adolescents and young adults prenatally exposed to alcohol. Methods: Ten adolescents and young adults with confirmed heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and a diagnosis within the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were included. Three of them had fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 3 had partial FAS (PFAS), and 4 had alcohol-related neurobehavioral disorder (ARND). The control group consisted of 10 adolescents matched for age, sex, head circumference, handedness, and body mass. Exclusionary criteria were learning disorders and prenatal alcohol exposure. Three-dimensional 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( 1H MRSI) was performed in the cerebrum and cerebellum. Metabolite ratios N-acetylaspartate/choline (NAA/Cho), NAA/creatine (Cr) and Cho/Cr, and absolute metabolite intensities were calculated for several anatomic regions. Results: In patients with FASD, lower NAA/Cho and/or NAA/Cr compared with controls were found in parietal and frontal cortices, frontal white matter, corpus callosum, thalamus, and cerebellar dentate nucleus. There was an increase in the absolute intensity of the glial markers Cho and Cr but no change in the neuronal marker NAA. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure alters brain metabolism in a long-standing or permanent manner in multiple brain areas. These changes are in accordance with previous findings from structural and functional studies. Metabolic alterations represent changes in the glial cell pool rather than in the neurons.

N2  - Background: Researchers are increasingly considering the importance of motor functioning of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The purpose of this study was to assess the motor development of young children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) to determine the presence and degree of delay in their motor skills and to compare their motor development with that of matched children without FAS. Methods: The motor development of 14 children ages 20 to 68 months identified with FAS was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). In addition, 2 comparison groups were utilized. Eleven of the children with FAS were matched for chronological age, gender, ethnicity, and communication age to: (1) 11 children with prenatal alcohol exposure who did not have FAS and (2) 11 matched children without any reported prenatal alcohol exposure. The motor scores on the VABS were compared among the 3 groups. Results: Most of the young children with FAS in this study showed clinically important delays in their motor development as measured on the VABS Motor Domain, and their fine motor skills were significantly more delayed than their gross motor skills. In the group comparisons, the young children with FAS had significantly lower Motor Domain standard (MotorSS) scores than the children not exposed to alcohol prenatally. They also had significantly lower Fine Motor Developmental Quotients than the children in both the other groups. No significant group differences were found in gross motor scores. For MotorSS scores and Fine Motor Developmental Quotients, the means and standard errors indicated a continuum in the scores from FAS to prenatal alcohol exposure to nonexposure. Conclusions: These findings strongly suggest that all young children with FAS should receive complete developmental evaluations that include assessment of their motor functioning, to identify problem areas and provide access to developmental intervention programs that target deficit areas such as fine motor skills. Fine motor delays in children with FAS may be related to specific neurobehavioral deficits that affect fine motor skills. The findings support the concept of an FASD continuum in some areas of motor development. Copyright © 2006 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) offer unique, noninvasive methods of measuring, respectively, in vivo quantitative neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. The main purpose of the present study was to identify and compare the neuroanatomical and neurochemical abnormalities that are associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol in both fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)-diagnosed children and those diagnosed with fetal alcohol effects (FAE). MR data of three age-, gender- and race-balanced groups of children, FAS-diagnosed, FAE-diagnosed and non-exposed controls, were compared. Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, regardless of diagnosis, were found in the caudate nucleus. Specifically, a significantly smaller caudate nucleus was found for the FAS and FAE participants compared to the controls. In addition, the metabolite ratio of N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr), an indicator of neuronal function, in left caudate nucleus of both the FAS and FAE participants was elevated compared to the control group. Analysis of absolute concentrations revealed that the increase in the ratio of NAA/Cr was due to an increase in NAA alone. Although its exact function in the CNS is unknown, NAA is believed to be a neuronal marker due to its exclusive localization to neurons. Some also speculate a role for NAA in myelination. Elevated NAA in the prenatal alcohol-exposed participants could indicate a lack of normal program cell death, dendritic pruning and/or myelination during development. The present study demonstrates that prenatal alcohol-exposed children, with or without facial dysmorphology, have abnormal brain anatomy and chemistry. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Effect of a single dose of ethanol on developing peripheral nerve of chick embryos
A1  - Chaudhuri J.D.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Fetal Alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy. It is characterized by physical and mental growth retardation, craniofacial anomalies and derangements of numerous body systems. A particular distressing feature of FAS is affection of the nervous system, which manifest as motor and sensory derangements and neurobehavioral deficits. However, no specific changes in the brain and spinal cord that could conclusively explain these neuronal defects have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single high dose of ethanol exposure during early gestation on the peripheral nerve, with a view to understanding the neuronal disorders appearing in FAS. A chick model of FAS was used and embryos were exposed to 5%, 10% and 15% ethanol immediately after hatching. The effects on general growth and development and on the peripheral nerve of ethanol-exposed embryos were examined following the full period of gestation. There was a significant reduction in crown-rump length, head circumference and body weight in ethanol-exposed chicks as compared with appropriate control groups. The degree of growth retardation among the different alcohol exposed groups was dose dependent and significant prenatal embryo mortality was seen in those exposed to 15% ethanol. In embryos that survived the exposure to 15% ethanol, features of myelin degeneration were observed in the peripheral nerve in the majority of cases. No features of myelin degeneration were observed in embryos exposed to 5% and 10% ethanol or in the control groups. This study demonstrates the direct toxic effects of a single high dose of ethanol on developing embryos in general and the peripheral nerves in particular. Accordingly the pathological changes observed in peripheral nerves could account for some of the neurobehavioral deficits observed in FAS.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is associated with macrostructural brain abnormalities, neurocognitive deficits, and behavioral disturbances, is characterized as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in severe cases. The only published study thus far using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed microstructural abnormalities in patients with FAS. The current study investigated whether similar abnormalities are present in less severely affected, prenatally exposed patients who did not display all of the typical FAS physical stigmata. Methods: Subjects included 14 children, ages 10 to 13, with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and 13 matched controls. Cases with full-criteria FAS, mental retardation, or microcephaly were excluded. Subjects underwent MRI scans including DTI. Results: Although cases with microcephaly were excluded, there was a trend toward smaller total cerebral volume in the FASD group (p=0.057, Cohen's d effect size =0.73). Subjects with FASD had greater mean diffusivity (MD) in the isthmus of the corpus callosum than controls (p=0.013, effect size =1.05), suggesting microstructural abnormalities in this region. There were no group differences in 5 other regions of the corpus callosum. Correlations between MD in the isthmus and facial dysmorphology were nonsignificant. Conclusions: These results suggest that even relatively mild forms of fetal alcohol exposure may be associated with microstructural abnormalities in the posterior corpus callosum that are detectable with DTI.

N2  - Background: This work was conducted in an effort to establish an oral intake model system in which the effects of ethanol insult that occur during early stages of embryogenesis can be easily examined and in which agents that may modulate ethanol's teratogenicity can be readily tested in vivo. The model system described utilizes the alcohol deprivation effect to obtain teratogenic levels of maternal ethanol intake on days 7 and 8 of pregnancy in C57Bl/6J mice. Ocular defects including microphthalmia and uveal coloboma, which have previously been shown to result from ethanol administered by gavage or via intraperitoneal injection on these days, served as the developmental end point for this study. The ocular defects are readily identifiable and their degree of severity is expected to correlate with concurrently developing defects of the central nervous system (CNS). Methods: Female C57Bl/6J mice were maintained on an ethanol-containing (4.8% v/v) liquid diet for 14 days and then mated during a subsequent abstinence period. Mice were then reexposed to ethanol on days 7 and 8 of pregnancy only. Control as well as ethanol-exposed dams were killed on their 14th day of pregnancy. Fetuses were then weighed, measured for crown rump length, photographed, and analyzed for ocular abnormalities. Globe size, palpebral fissure length, and pupil size and shape were noted for both the right and left eyes of all fetuses and informative comparisons were made. Results: This exposure paradigm resulted in peak maternal blood alcohol concentrations that ranged from 170 to 220 mg/dL on gestational day (GD) 8. Compared with the GD 14 fetuses from the normal control group, the pair-fed, acquisition controls, as well as the ethanol-exposed fetuses, were developmentally delayed and had reduced weights. Confirming previous studies, comparison of similarly staged control and treated GD 8 embryos illustrated reductions in the size of the forebrain in the latter. Subsequent ocular malformations were noted in 33% of the right eyes and 25% of the left eyes of the 103 GD 14 ethanol-exposed fetuses examined. This incidence of defects is twice that observed in the control groups. Additionally, it was found that the palpebral fissure length is directly correlated with globe size. Conclusions: The high incidence of readily identifiable ocular malformations produced by oral ethanol intake in this model and their relevance to human fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) makes this an excellent system for utilization in experiments involving factors administered to the embryo that might alter ethanol's teratogenic effects. Additionally, the fact that early ethanol insult yields ocular and forebrain abnormalities that are developmentally associated allows efficient specimen selection for subsequent detailed analyses of CNS effects in this in vivo mammalian FASD model.

Method: From a longitudinal prospective study beginning with interviews of 1,529 pregnant women, a birth cohort of about 500 newborns was chosen to include all of the most heavily alcohol exposed plus a sampling of the continuum of alcohol exposures from total abstinence through heavy drinking. At an average age of 25.7 years, 400 members of this birth cohort were administered valid Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV (SCID), including both the SCID for axis I disorders and the SCID for axis II personality disorders. Results: The odds of the appearance of six psychiatric disorders and traits were more than double in adults exposed to one or more binge alcohol episodes in utero. Three of these six odds ratios were uniformly stable against confounding: axis I substance dependence or abuse disorders and axis II passive-aggressive and antisocial personality disorders or traits. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to alcohol may be a risk factor for specific psychiatric disorders and traits in early adulthood, even in a nonclinical group.

N2  - Context: Little is known about the contribution of fetal alcohol exposure to the development of alcohol disorders in early adulthood. Objective: To examine the independent effect of maternal alcohol use during early vs late periods in pregnancy on the time of onset of alcohol disorders in offspring. Design: Follow-up study of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy and Its Outcomes (MUSP), a population-based birth cohort study commenced in Brisbane, Australia, in 1981 and designed to examine the association of maternal alcohol exposure with the onset of alcohol disorders. Mothers and children were followed up at birth, 6 months, and 5, 14, and 21 years after the initial interview. Maternal alcohol use was assessed before pregnancy, in early and late pregnancy, and at the 5- and 14-year follow-up visits. Alcohol disorders in early adulthood were assessed at age 21 years using the lifetime version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-computerized version. Setting: Population-based birth cohort study. Participants: A subsample of 2138 participants for whom complete data were available at the 21-year follow-up. Main Outcome Measure: Onset of alcohol disorder from adolescence to 21 years of age. Results: In utero alcohol exposure of 3 or more glasses was associated with alcohol disorders. The fully adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of developing early-onset alcohol disorders at age 21 years were 2.95 (1.62-5.36) for those exposed to maternal drinking in early pregnancy and 1.35 (0.69-2.63) for those exposed in late pregnancy. There was also a strong association between alcohol exposure in early pregnancy and late-onset alcohol disorders (odds ratio, 3.29 [95% confidence interval, 1.74-6.24]). Conclusions: Our results provide support for a biological origin of adult alcohol disorders and suggest that the association is not explained solely by maternal drinking or smoking during childhood and adolescence or other intervening factors. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the association. ©2006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Accurate estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in a Western European population are lacking and are of particular interest in settings where the usual pattern of alcohol consumption is thought to be daily drinking with meals. To address these issues, an epidemiology study of FAS and other FASD was undertaken in Italian schools. Methods: Primary schools (n=25) in 2 health districts of the Lazio region were randomly selected and recruited for the study. Five hundred forty-three children, 50% of those enrolled in first-grade classes, received parental permission to participate in a 2-tiered, active case ascertainment screening process. Detailed evaluation of children selected in a preliminary screening phase was carried out on those who were small for height, weight, and head circumference and/or referred by teachers for suspected learning and behavioral problems. Detailed evaluation was carried out on each child's: (1) physical growth and dysmorphology, (2) psychological development and behavior, and (3) prenatal exposure to alcohol and other risk factors for FASD via maternal interviews. A group of 67 randomly selected children without FASD from the same classes was utilized as a comparison group. Results: Using 2 denominators for prevalence estimation, a conservative one and a strict sample-based estimate, the prevalence of FAS in this province of Italy was 3.7 to 7.4 per 1,000 children. When cases of partial FAS (PFAS) and a case of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental deficits (ARND) were added to FAS cases, the rate of FASD was 20.3 to 40.5 per 1,000 and estimated at 35 per 1,000 overall or between 2.3 and 4.1% of all children. This exceeds previously published estimates of both FAS and FASD for the western world. Detailed data are presented that demonstrate the utility of the guidelines of the revised Institute of Medicine diagnostic criteria for FASD. Children with FASD are significantly more impaired/affected (p<0.05) than randomly selected comparison children on all measures of growth deficiency, key facial features of FASD, overall dysmorphology scores, language comprehension, nonverbal IQ, and behavior. Maternal reports of current drinking were significantly higher for mothers of FASD children than comparison mothers, but reported rates of overall drinking during pregnancy were not significantly different. In contrast to expectations, daily drinking among mothers of the comparison group was not common. However, dysmorphology scores of the children were significantly correlated with drinking in the second and third trimesters, drinks per current drinking day, and current drinks per month. Finally, children with the physical features of FASD had lower IQs; nonverbal IQ was significantly correlated with head circumference and negatively correlated with overall dysmorphology score, smooth philtrum, and several other facial and physical anomalies characteristic of FAS. Conclusions: Using careful measures of ascertainment in a primary school setting, these results provide relatively high estimates of the prevalence of FASD and raise the question of whether FASD is more common in the western world than previously estimated.

N2  - Ancient scripture and paintings together with several medical reports on the effect of alcohol on the newborn over the past 300 years finally led to the description of the fetal alcohol syndrome in the 1970s by French and American research groups. Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can result in the specific pattern of malformations and neurocognitive deficits characteristic of this syndrome. Diagnostic criteria and classifications have been developed and in the 1990s reports showed the long-term consequences for these children. In recent years several studies from different countries have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure will lead to life-long consequences on physical development, intellectual development, behavior, social development, occupation, independence, sexuality or sexual behavior and increased risk of suicidality. In this review of long-term observation studies we found that the prenatal exposure to alcohol have permanent and life-long damage, which impair both the social and occupational future of the person exposed with a need for life-long assistance in order for that person to function at an optimal level. Primary prevention and early intervention with general public health educational efforts seems to be the best way forward.

N2  - Women who drink while pregnant are at a high risk of giving birth to children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Heavy consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is also known to be deleterious to fetal bone growth in both humans and laboratory animals. However, nothing is known regarding the effect of maternal moderate and heavy alcohol binging on fetal and maternal bone strength. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of moderate and heavy alcohol binging throughout gestation on fetal and maternal bone growth and strength. The study was conducted using an ovine model system. The large body mass of the ovine fetus, the longer gestation that is more similar to that of humans, and the fact that all three trimester equivalents occur in utero, make the sheep an excellent model for studying Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Suffolk ewes were mated and, beginning on gestational day 4, received intravenous infusions over 1 h on 3 consecutive days per week followed by 4 days without treatment concluding on day 132 of pregnancy. Pregnant ewes were divided into four groups: two alcohol treatment groups (0.75 and 1.75 g/kg of body weight), one pair-fed saline control group, and an untreated normal control group. The fetuses were harvested on gestational day 133. Maternal and fetal femoral and tibial dimensions were measured and the maximum strength (MPa) carried by the bone tissue was determined using a three-point bending procedure. Maternal bones were not different among groups. The higher alcohol dose resulted in reduced fetal femoral bone strength, whereas the tibial bone strength was lower when compared with the normal control subjects. In contrast, the lower alcohol dose increased fetal femoral strength compared to the normal control subjects. The alcohol-exposed fetal bones also tended to exhibit reduced lengths. We conclude that binge alcohol exposure throughout gestation resulted in dose-dependent differences in the maximum stress absorbed by the fetal bones. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - In Italy, little is known about the problems related to alcohol drinking during pregnancy. In this paper, the Italian literature about this subject is briefly reviewed. This first Italian experience of a field study, aimed to the assessment of the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in an area in the Rome province (Lazio region) is reported. This in-field study was performed in the school years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 in cooperation with American researchers, most from University of New Mexico (Albuquerque), and Italian researchers from University "la Sapienza" of Rome. First grade children (ndegree = 1086) of primary school were contacted to enter in the in-school study for the detection of FAS and FASD and were examined by the experts team of clinicians, pediatrics, psychologists. Preliminary consideration and the implications of this study for FASD prevention are discussed.

N2  - Over thirty years of research has revealed that prenatal exposure to alcohol has a devastating impact on the structure and function of the developing central nervous system. Imaging studies over the past ten years have improved our understanding of the structural alterations related to prenatal alcohol exposure and provided researchers with potential hypotheses for brain-behavior relationships. Structural alterations associated with prenatal alcohol exposure have been found in overall brain size, shape, and symmetry, along with regional decreases in white and gray matter. In addition, abnormalities have been noted in specific structures such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. This review demonstrates that specific areas of the brain may be more vulnerable to prenatal exposure to alcohol.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a large and rapidly increasing public health problem worldwide. Aside the full-blown FAS, multiple terms are used to describe the continuum of effects that result from prenatal exposure to alcohol, including the whole fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The revised Institute of Medicine (IOM) Diagnostic Classification System and the diagnostic criteria for FAS and FASD are reported, as well as the formation of the four-state FAS International Consortium and its aims, as the development of an information base that systematizes data collection that helps to determine at-high-risk populations, and to implement and test a scientific-based prevention/intervention model for at risk women. The Consortium was further enlarged, with the inclusion of some more states (including Italy), leading to the formation of the International Consortium for the Investigation of FASD. The objectives of the Consortium are reported, as well as its previous activities, the South Africa and Italy Projects (active case ascertainment initiatives), and its future activities.

N2  - Objective: In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), we have previously found an alteration in NMDA receptors suggesting mediation, at least in part, of alcohol-related learning deficit. NMDA and GABA receptors interact in a multisynaptic circuit for the regulation of the inhibitory tone through the CNS. The GABA receptor subunit GABAAalpha5 is involved in learning and is developmentally regulated, as it is excitatory in the perinatal brain and inhibitory in the adult. We were interested to evaluate alcohol's effect on GABAAalpha5 expression to further understand alcohol-induced learning dysfunction. Study design: Timed, pregnant C57B16/Jmice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol, 0.03 mL/kg ip) or control (saline). Embryos and brains were harvested 10 days after treatment, and brains from adult offspring were collected after evaluation in the Morris Water Maze, a well-established test for spatial learning. Gene expression included samples from at least 3 litters per timepoint, and calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to quantify GABAAalpha5 with GAPDH standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure significantly decreased GABAAalpha5 expression in the embryo (P < .02) and fetal brains (P < .01) 10 days after therapy. However, in adult brains GABAAalpha5 expression was increased versus controls (P < .01). As previously demonstrated, prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in deficits in adults learning the Morris Water Maze with controls learning faster (P < .05). Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure alters developmental GABAAalpha5 expression. This may further explain the long-lasting damage of alcohol on learning skills. Both the alcohol-induced reduction in the GABAAalpha5 subunit during development and up-regulation in adult brain may be related to learning deficits resulting in decreased learning potential caused by the developmental defect and an increased inhibition of learning resulting from increased expression as an adult. In combination with our previous findings, these suggest that alcohol-induced learning impairment is likely the result of alterations of both NMDA and GABA expression and function. © 2006 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are among the leading preventable causes of developmental disorders in the United States; however, recognition and prevention of these conditions cannot be achieved without informed and educated health providers. This commentary addresses the importance of recognition and prevention of FASDs through the use of well-established standardized practices of diagnosis, screening, and brief alcohol reduction counseling. It is hoped that more knowledge on currently available procedures will encourage their use in the provision of routine health care to all women of childbearing age.

T1  - Brain deficits associated with fetal alcohol exposure may be protected, in part, by peptides derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein
A1  - Sari Y.
A1  - Gozes I.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This review discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain and the potential use of derived peptides from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) in neuroprotection against the insults of alcohol. Alcohol is known to impede the growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through cellular apoptosis. Sari et al. have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure reduced the fetal brain weight, the size of the brain regions and the number of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure compromises neural tube midline development. Sari et al. further suggested that the timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy is critical to the induction of deficits in 5-HT neurons, as well as other types of neurons and consequently results in deficits in neural tube development. ADNF and ADNP are glial-derived proteins discovered to be induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These proteins are expressed during embryonic development. Functional assays and genetic manipulations have identified these proteins as highly important for neural tube closure and brain formation/development. The peptide derivatives of ADNF, ADNF-14 (VLGGGSALLRSIPA), ADNF-9 (or SALLRSIPA = SAL) and of ADNP, NAPVSIPQ = NAP have shown neuroprotective effects and have been proven to prevent brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. Here, we discuss the many aspects of alcohol-associated growth restriction in the developing brain and the potential inhibition of this severe phenotype through the use of neuroprotective peptides. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - A retrospective review of self-reported alcohol intake among women attending for antenatal care in Far North Queensland
A1  - Rimmer C.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are known to occur among children delivered to women in Far North Queensland; to date, the problem has not been quantified or related directly to maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Aims: To identify the characteristics of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy, in order to identify 'high-risk' women to whom educational intervention regarding fetal alcohol syndrome may be targeted. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study using the case notes of all women attending the antenatal booking clinic in Cairns Base Hospital over the 3-month period from April to June 2005. Obstetric and demographic information and self-reported alcohol intake before and during pregnancy were noted and self-reported alcohol intake before and during pregnancy. Results: Five hundred and forty-one women were included in this study. Of these women, 24.6% were found to consume alcohol during pregnancy and 57.7% were found to consume alcohol before pregnancy, indicating a reduction in alcohol consumed once women became aware of pregnancy. The most significant indicator for alcohol consumption during pregnancy was found to be alcohol consumption before pregnancy. Of women who consumed alcohol in pregnancy, 71.5% drank moderate amounts of alcohol before pregnancy and 28.7% drank heavily before pregnancy. Conclusion: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is common in Far North Queensland. Methods currently used during antenatal booking visits to determine alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy are unreliable. Strategies to identify women consuming alcohol before and during pregnancy and education programs are vitally important if the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome and spectrum disorder is to be reduced. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading cause of preventable mental retardation and developmental disabilities, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Current medical guidelines recommend that no alcohol should be consumed over the period of conception and throughout pregnancy. Although the majority of women reduce alcohol consumption when they realize they are pregnant, this recognition may not occur until well into the first trimester, potentially impacting embryonic development. Objectives: To describe and assess changes in patterns of women's alcohol use between the preconception, pre-pregnancy recognition and post-pregnancy recognition time periods. Secondly, to describe characteristics of women consuming any alcohol and those binge drinking during pre- and post-pregnancy recognition periods. Methods: Computer assisted telephone interviews were conducted with 1042 women who had recently delivered a baby in urban Alberta, Canada. Differences in consumption patterns between time periods were analyzed using analysis of variance and Chi-square tests. Characteristics of those drinking both before and after pregnancy recognition were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: Eighty percent of women reported alcohol consumption pre-conceptually, 50% pre-pregnancy recognition and 18% post-pregnancy recognition. Binge drinking was reported by 32%, 11% and 0% for preconception, pre-pregnancy recognition and post-pregnancy recognition periods, respectively. Alcohol consumption patterns (i.e., the mean number of drinks per drinking day and week) did not differ significantly between preconception and pre-pregnancy recognition periods but did significantly drop after pregnancy recognition (p<0.001). Alcohol use during the period of pre-pregnancy recognition was higher among those not planning a pregnancy, not using assisted reproductive technology, of higher income, without a history of miscarriage, who were Caucasian, and who used tobacco. Binge drinking was higher among women not planning a pregnancy, those who used tobacco, and those with low self-esteem. Women continuing to drink small amounts of alcohol after pregnancy recognition were more likely to be between the ages of 30-39 years, be Caucasian and use tobacco. Conclusion: Preconception and "well-women" counseling strategies would be improved by increasing the emphasis on the risks of alcohol use during periods when pregnancy can occur. ©2006 Marshfield Clinic.

N2  - Background: In most cases of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), the pathognomonic facial features are absent making diagnosis challenging, if not impossible, particularly when no history of maternal drinking is available. Also because FASD is often comorbid with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), children with FASD are frequently improperly diagnosed and receive the wrong treatment. Since access to psychological testing is typically limited or non-existent in remote areas, other diagnostic methods are needed to provide necessary interventions. Objectives: To determine if a characteristic behavioural phenotype distinguishes children with FASD from typically developing children and children with ADHD and use this information to create a screening tool for FASD diagnosis. Methods: Parents and caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a well-established standardized tool for evaluating children's behavioural problems. Results from 30 children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disability, 30 children with ADHD, and 30 typically developing healthy children matched for age and socioeconomic status with FASD were analyzed. Based on our previous work, 12 CBCL items that significantly differentiated FASD and control groups were selected for further analyses. Stepwise discriminant function analysis identified behavioural characteristics most strongly differentiating groups and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analyses determined sensitivity and specificity of different item combinations. Results: Seven items reflecting hyperactivity, inattention, lying and cheating, lack of guilt, and disobedience significantly differentiated children with FASD from controls. ROC analyses showed scores of 6 or higher on these items differentiated groups with a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 82%. For FASD and ADHD, two combinations of items significantly differentiated groups with high sensitivity and specificity (i) no guilt, cruelty, and acts young (sensitivity = 70%; specificity = 80% (ii) acts young, cruelty, no guilt, lying or cheating, steals from home, and steals outside (sensitivity = 81%; specificity = 72%). These items were used to construct a potential FASD screening tool. Conclusions: Our findings identifying the behavioural characteristics differentiating children with FASD from typically developing children or children with ADHD have the potential for development of an empirically derived tool for FASD tool to be used in remote areas where psychological services are not readily available. This technique may speed up diagnosis and intervention for children without ready access to formal assessments. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related birth defects represent a spectrum of disorders that can result from the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that alcohol exposure in utero adversely affects hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Neonatal mice that were exposed in utero to alcohol showed a marked delay in B lymphocyte development. Recent studies have focused on an oligopotential progenitor cell, with the phenotype of HSAloCD43loLin-, which yields both B cells and myeloid lineage cells at a high frequency when cultured in vitro with stromal cells and the appropriate cytokines. However, these progenitor cells isolated from neonatal offspring of alcohol fed dams showed a significant decrease in the frequency of B cell formation following in vitro culture. In order to understand the mechanism underlying this defect we examined the expression of key transcription factors (early B cell factor, EBF, and Pax5) in this progenitor pool. Here, we report that >95% of HSAloCD43loLin- cells express EBF and 5% express Pax5. Following liquid culture in the presence of IL-7, these progenitor cells respond by up-regulating Pax5 and the surface expression of CD19 indicating that the cells have committed to the B lineage. By contrast 75% of HSAloCD43loLin- cells isolated from the bone marrow of neonatal animals exposed in utero to alcohol expressed EBF but at a level that was less than 25% the level of cells isolated from control animals. Furthermore, these alcohol-exposed progenitor cells failed to up-regulate Pax5 in response to IL-7 indicating a greatly reduced capacity to expand and differentiate to B lineage cells in liquid cultures. However, the HSAloCD43loLin- cells isolated from the alcohol exposed animals retained the capacity to differentiate to myeloid lineage cells. These results suggest that the interference with the sequential expression of transcription factors in early progenitor cells by in utero alcohol exposure is a potential mechanism for the observed decrease in B lymphocytes in neonatal mice. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Biomarkers of fetal exposure to alcohol are important to establish so that early detection and intervention can be made on these infants to prevent undesirable outcomes. The aim of this study was to analyze long-chain fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium as potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol exposure and effect. Methods: Fatty acid ethyl esters were analyzed in the meconium of 124 singleton infants by positive chemical ionization gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and correlated to maternal ethanol use. Results: A total of 124 mother/infant dyads were enrolled in the study: 31 were in the control group and 93 were in the alcohol-exposed group. The incidence (28% vs 9.7%, p=0.037) of ethyl linoleate detected in meconium was significantly higher in the alcohol-exposed groups than the control groups. Similarly, when the concentrations of ethyl linoleate in meconium were grouped (trichotomized), there was a significant linear by linear association between alcohol exposure and group concentrations of ethyl linoleate (p=0.013). Furthermore, only alcohol-exposed infants were found in the group with the highest ethyl linoleate concentration. The sensitivity of ethyl linoleate in detecting prenatal alcohol exposure was only 26.9%, and its specificity and positive predictive value were 96.8 and 96.2%, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the concentration of ethyl linoleate in meconium and absolute alcohol consumed (oz) per drinking day across pregnancy, although a trend toward a positive correlation is seen at lower amounts of alcohol consumed. Among the polyunsaturated, long-chain FAEEs, there was weak evidence that the incidence (21.5% vs 6.5%, p=0.057) and concentration (p=0.064) of ethyl arachidonate (AA) were significantly higher in the alcohol-exposed groups than the control groups. Ethyl linolenate and ethyl docosahexanoate (DHA) in meconium were found only in the alcohol group, although not at statistically significant levels. Highly significant correlations were found among the concentrations of ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, ethyl AA, and ethyl DHA in meconium (correlations ranged between rs=0.203, p=0.024; and rs=0.594, p<0.001). Conclusion: We conclude that FAEEs in meconium, particularly ethyl linoleate and ethyl AA, are biomarkers of high specificity for prenatal exposure to alcohol in newborn infants. We also propose that ethyl AA and DHA could be potential biomarkers of fetal alcohol effects on the developing fetal brain and should be investigated further.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters limb development that may lead to structural and functional abnormalities of the limb reported in children diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. To determine whether PAE alters the central representation of the forelimb we used the rodent barrel cortex as our model system where it was possible to visualize and quantitatively measure the size of the forepaw representation in the forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) in first somatosensory cortex. In the present study, we examined the effects of PAE on pattern and size of the forepaw and forepaw representation in FBS in neonatal rats at gestational day 32 that corresponds to postnatal day 9. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically intubated with binge doses of ethanol (6 g/kg) from gestational day 1 through gestational day 20. The offspring of the ethanol treated dams comprised the ethanol (EtOH) group. The effect of PAE on the EtOH group was compared with a nutritional-controlled pairfed (PF) group and a normal chowfed (CF) group. The ventral (glabrous) surface area of the forepaw digits, length of digit 2 through digit 5, and the corresponding glabrous forepaw digit representations in the FBS were measured and compared between treatment groups. In rats exposed to in utero alcohol, the sizes of the overall glabrous forepaw and forepaw digits were significantly reduced in EtOH pups compared to CF and PF pups; overall glabrous forepaw area was 11% smaller than CF controls. Glabrous digit lengths were also smaller in EtOH rats compared to CF controls and significantly smaller in digit 2 through digit 4. The glabrous digit representation in FBS was 18% smaller in the EtOH group when compared to the CF treatment. However, PAE did not produce malformations in the forepaw or alter the pattern of the forepaw representation in FBS; instead, PAE significantly reduced both body and brain weights compared to controls. Unexpectedly, little or no correlation was observed between the size of the glabrous forepaw compared to the size of the glabrous forepaw representation in the FBS for any of the treatment groups. The present findings of PAE-related alterations in sensory periphery and the central cortical representation may underlie deficits in sensorimotor integration reported among children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - Objective: This study investigated whether there were differential effects of substantial prenatal alcohol exposure on letter and category fluency in children. Given that children with prenatal alcohol exposure are often impaired in executive functioning and that letter fluency taxes executive processes more than category fluency, it was expected that children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) would be more impaired in letter than in category fluency. A second objective of the study was to examine the developmental trends in the two types of fluency in children with prenatal alcohol exposure. It was hypothesized that between the ages of 6 and 9 years, these FAS children would show age-related changes in category fluency but not in letter fluency. Method: As part of a neuropsychological test battery designed for an international collaborative study of FAS in South Africa, tests of letter and category fluency were administered in Afrikaans. The participants were 62 children with FAS and 61 controls matched with respect to age, gender (58 boys and 65 girls), ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results: Results showed that the FAS group had relatively greater difficulty with letter fluency than with category fluency and that the FAS group generated fewer words in both fluency conditions. Contrary to the expectation, however, alcohol-affected children demonstrated age-related linear trends in both letter and category fluency. Conclusions: This is the first study of verbal fluency involving a large sample of well-diagnosed children with FAS conducted in a nonwestern environment. The results are nonetheless consistent with those obtained in western countries in studies of children with various levels of prenatal alcohol exposure and various levels of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This study suggests that at least some aspects of the cognitive profile associated with prenatal alcohol exposure may be generalizable across cultural and ethnic boundaries.

N2  - Motor coordination was assessed in two samples of adult subjects: one sample (n = 90) included adults previously diagnosed with one of a number of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and comparison peers, the second was a prospective longitudinal study of adults who were exposed to varying levels of alcohol as fetuses (n = 402). This comparative analysis sought to determine whether motor effects seen in both clinical and nonclinical children persist into adulthood, whether any individual motor tasks show significant effects of prenatal alcohol exposure across the age range, and whether motor assessments of adults have any role in diagnostic strategies for adults suspected of FASD. Motor tests included balance and unilateral, bilateral, finger, hand and foot coordination. Three-quarters of the subjects with FASD demonstrated deficits in motor function outside the range of comparison subjects. Adults with FASD performed more poorly, on average, on all individual tests including balance and fine motor control. In the prospective longitudinal sample, only subjects who had been previously identified in childhood as having a possible diagnosis on the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum were still in deficit as adults on motor tasks, relative to comparison subjects. Thus, the dose-dependent motor coordination effects of alcohol previously found in children do not appear to persist into adulthood, except in those most highly exposed children who also have other accompanying neuropsychological effects in childhood. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The brains of fetal alcohol syndrome patients exhibit impaired neuronal migration, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying this abnormality. Here we show that Ca2+ signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of alcohol action in neuronal cell migration. Acute administration of ethanol reduced the frequency of transient Ca2+ elevations in migrating neurons and cGMP levels and increased cAMP levels. Experimental manipulations of these second-messenger pathways, through stimulating Ca2+ and cGMP signaling or inhibiting cAMP signaling, completely reversed the action of ethanol on neuronal migration in vitro as well as in vivo. Each second messenger has multiple but distinct downstream targets, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, calcineurin, protein phosphatase 1, Rho GTPase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. These results demonstrate that the aberrant migration of immature neurons in the fetal brain caused by maternal alcohol consumption may be corrected by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways.

N2  - We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying self-reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health professionals at the Maipu Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption, and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p = 0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age (p = 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile, clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Inc.

N2  - The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human comprise a spectrum of structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We previously have proposed revisions to the 1996 Institute of Medicine Diagnostic Criteria for diagnoses in the FASD continuum [fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)], allowing for more reproducible and accurate FASD diagnosis in a clinical setting [Hoyme et al, 2005]. The NIAAA recently has coordinated and funded an international consortium of projects aimed at more complete characterization of the teratogenic spectrum of alcohol. One of the projects sites is in Finland. The aims of this project are: (1) to completely clinically characterize the structural and learning/behavioral phenotypes of a large cohort of older children and adolescents with moderate to severe disability within the FASD continuum; (2) to correlate FASD dysmorphology and behavioral phenotypes with CNS structure and function (i.e., MRS, MRI correlations); (3) to compare the phenotype of a genetically homogeneous population of Finnish children with FASD to that observed in other populations. We have recently completed dysmorphology examination and parent/guardian interviews of the 77 children in the Finnish cohort. The purpose of this report is to present historical and morphometric data on these patients, thereby more completely delineating the clinical spectrum of FASD in older children and adolescents, contrasting the phenotype with that described in other populations and examining whether a weighted dysmorphology score could be used as a clinical and research adjunct when fetal alcohol exposure is being suspected. All children were previously diagnosed with FASD by an experienced pediatric specialist in Finland, and all were exposed to significant maternal alcohol abuse prenatally. The sex ratio of the cohort was 0.38 (male: female) and ages ranged from 8 to 20 years, with a mean of 13 years. After application of the Revised IOM Diagnostic Criteria, 53% of the subjects were diagnosed as having FAS, 30% PFAS, 12% ARND, and 5% other diagnoses. Of note, although a family history of mental retardation or birth defects was rare, 43% of the children had one or more sibling who also carried a diagnosis of FAS. Eighty-nine percent of the mothers smoked cigarettes during gestation; other teratogenic exposures were rare. Almost none had undergone genetics evaluation in the past. Almost all of the subjects had resided in multiple foster placements since early childhood and had been followed regularly by pediatric specialists. Although 11% were born prematurely, 70% demonstrated prenatal growth deficiency, and 45% were microcephalic. Other than growth deficits and the cardinal facial features, the most common major and minor anomalies noted were: camptodactyly (55%), "hockey stick" or other altered palmar creases (51%), refractive errors (40%), strabismus (38%), dental crowding (43%), nail hypoplasia (38%), GU anomalies (22%), and congenital heart defects (18%), "Railroad track" ears were not observed in this population. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with learning, behavioral, and academic problems even in children without the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Objective: To examine the prenatal alcohol exposure and ability, academic achievement, and school functioning in adolescence. Methods: In a longitudinal cohort, intelligence, academic performance, and school functioning were evaluated in 265 low socioeconomic status (SES) adolescents (M age = 15.1 years), 128 prenatally exposed to alcohol, 53 controls, and 84 special education students by using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd edition (WISC-III) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT). School records were abstracted for grade point averages (GPA), standardized achievement test scores, conduct, attendance, and special education placement. Results: Alcohol-affected youth had significantly lower IQs than those in the other three groups. Conclusion: Although academic achievement (WIAT scores) was most impaired in the special education group who showed lower performance over all as well as in reading and spelling, alcohol-affected youth showed significant deficits on mathematics subtests. There was no increased incidence of conduct problems in school records related to alcohol exposure. © The Author 2005.

N2  - Alcohol abuse in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranging from discreet developmental problems to fetal alcohol syndrome. That is why pregnant women and the women considering pregnancy should abstain from alcohol. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders occur even after drinking at early stages of pregnancy when women are not aware of being pregnant. According to one study 75% Czech women drank alcohol before pregnancy and one third of them continued during first three months of pregnancy. According to new epidemiological data 83.4% of Czech women aged between 18 and 40 drank alcohol during the year preceeding the pregnancy. The prevention in this area in the Czech Republic is clearly not satisfactory, and it is complicated by the alcohol advertising targeted at women, low taxation of alcohol and other factors.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Elevated levels of fatty acid ethyl esters have been documented in the meconium of neonates born to heavily drinking mothers. Recently, accumulation of FAEE has been documented in the hair of drinking adults. To be able to use this test in the diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, one needs to establish baseline FAEE levels in infants born to nonalcoholic women because ethanol occurs in the baby naturally even without drinking. Scalp hair of 56 infants born to nonalcoholic women attending a well-baby clinic was obtained. Levels of FAEE were measured by GC-MS. FAEE were detected in almost all hair samples. Offspring of women admitting to mild, infrequent drinking did not differ in FAEE hair levels from infants of total abstainers. Baseline levels of FAEE in neonatal hair of nonalcoholic mothers have been established. Mild infrequent maternal drinking does not elevate these baseline levels. This may help avoid false-positive determinations when assessing infants born to problem drinking mothers.

T1  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy
A1  - Krulewitch C.J.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Alcohol is a potent teratogen in humans, and prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) refers to a pattern of birth defects found in children of mothers who drank during pregnancy. FAS has four criteria: maternal drinking during pregnancy, a characteristic pattern of facial abnormalities, growth retardation, and brain damage (often manifested by intellectual difficulties or behavioral problems). As surveillance and research have progressed, it has become clear that FAS is but a rare example of a wide array of defects that can occur from exposure to alcohol in utero. At least 1 in 10 women will continue to consume alcohol during pregnancy, putting their fetuses at risk for the effects of alcohol exposure. Nurses are in a key position to provide care and conduct research that will contribute to the prevention of the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure during the preconception and perinatal periods, as well as deal with the negative outcomes of exposure in the developing infant. Many areas have yet to be evaluated. Screening tools and interventions have been developed and tested, mostly in majority cultures. Culturally sensitive instruments must be generated and validated for high-risk groups such as Native Americans. Fetal alcohol biomarkers and genetic research are new and need considerably more work. Effective "no drinking during pregnancy" campaigns for high-risk groups must be created and tested. Nurses are well placed to conduct research that will describe the effects at social, behavioral, and biological levels; develop middle-range theories targeted at preventing the drinking behavior and optimizing care of affected children after birth; and generate and test effective interventions that enhance prevention strategies in the 21st century.

T1  - Guidelines for identifying and referring persons with fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Bertrand J.
A1  - Floyd L.L.
A1  - Weber M.K.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) results from maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and carries lifelong consequences. Early recognition of FAS can result in better outcomes for persons who receive a diagnosis. Although FAS was first identified in 1973, persons with this condition often do not receive a diagnosis. In 2002, Congress directed CDC to update and refine diagnostic and referral criteria for FAS, incorporating recent scientific and clinical evidence. In 2002, CDC convened a scientific working group (SWG) of persons with expertise in FAS research, diagnosis, and treatment to draft criteria for diagnosing FAS. This report summarizes the diagnostic guidelines drafted by the SWG, provides recommendations for when and how to refer a person suspected of having problems related to prenatal alcohol exposure, and assesses existing practices for creating supportive environments that might prevent long-term adverse consequences associated with FAS. The guidelines were created on the basis of a review of scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and the experiences of families affected by FAS regarding the physical and neuropsychologic features of FAS and the medical, educational, and social services needed by persons with FAS and their families. The guidelines are intended to facilitate early identification of persons affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol so they and their families can receive services that enable them to achieve healthy lives and reach their full potential. This report also includes recommendations to enhance identification of and intervention for women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Additional data are needed to develop diagnostic criteria for other related disorders (e.g., alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder).

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - QUESTION: By the time women find out they are pregnant and see a family physician, they might have already consumed alcohol during the pregnancy and affected the development of their fetuses. How can family physicians better prevent exposure to alcohol during pregnancy? ANSWER: Women of childbearing age should be counseled about the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy before they become pregnant. Diagnosing children who have fetal alcohol spectrum disorders can help identify birth mothers who are at risk of other alcohol-exposed pregnancies and who need support to change their behaviour.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to examine fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) among Japanese children of alcoholic mothers. This is the first report concerning FASD in Japan. METHODS: The subjects were 30 alcoholic women who were inpatients in the Kurihama Alcoholism Center and had given birth to children. They were subjected to a semi-structured interview by the author. Sixty healthy women who had not drunk during pregnancy were used as a control group, and they also underwent semi-structured interviews. The alcoholic women were divided into two groups, 13 who drunk during pregnancies and 17 who did not drink. Twenty children experienced of prenatal alcohol exposure and 40 children did not. The three groups; i.e., 13 alcoholic mothers who had drunk during pregnancy and their 20 children (ALD group), 17 alcoholic mothers who had not drunk during pregnancy and their 40 children (ALND group) and 60 non-alcoholic control mothers and their 80 children (Control group), were compared concerning the mothers' drinking problems and abnormal deliveries, children's birth weights, congenital abnormalities, abnormalities of the central nervous system and psychological problems. RESULTS: The mean age of onset of problem drinking of the mothers in the ALD group was significantly lower than that in the mothers of the ALND group, and some of the mothers in the ALD group showed alcohol dependence before their pregnancies. The mean birth weights of the children of the ALD group, ALND group and Control group were 2816 g, 3128 g and 3142 g, respectively and the differences were significant. The children of the ALD group had significantly more abnormal birth episodes, developmental retardation and psychiatric symptoms than those in the other two groups. Among 20 children in the ALD group, FASD was suspected in 6 children (10% of the children of alcoholic mothers). Six children had low birth weights, abnormal birth episodes, mental retardation and psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: One third of the Japanese children of alcoholic mothers had experiences of prenatal alcohol exposure and 10% of them had suspected FASD abnormalities.

T1  - The neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Welch-Carre E.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - During pregnancy, ingestion of alcohol, a known teratogen, can cause harm to the fetus. Prenatal alcohol exposure is one of the leading causes of birth defects, developmental disorders, and mental retardation in children. The fetal central nervous system is particularly vulnerable to alcohol; this vulnerability contributes to many of the long-term disabilities and disorders seen in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure. Diagnoses associated with prenatal alcohol exposure include fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and alcohol-related birth defects. Once diagnosed, early intervention improves the long-term outcome of affected children. Without documentation of maternal alcohol use, a diagnosis, and consequently treatment, is often difficult to attain. It is imperative that nurses, physicians, and other healthcare providers become comfortable with obtaining a history of, and providing anticipatory guidance and counseling about, alcohol use.

N2  - PURPOSE: The incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is increasing, even though it is 100% preventable. This study examined use of, knowledge about, and attitudes toward alcohol of women requesting emergency contraception (EC) and/or a pregnancy test, and evaluated whether a brief intervention would be effective in educating them about the risks of FASD. DATA SOURCES: Fifty women from two outpatient clinics participated. Information was collected on demographic and personal health habits, alcohol use, and knowledge of and attitudes toward alcohol. As a brief intervention to increase knowledge about FASD, participants read a short pamphlet about the risks of alcohol exposure in pregnancy and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and skewness, were calculated for all variables. Pearson correlations were computed to assess relationships between demographic/lifestyle variables and attitudes toward and knowledge about alcohol. Paired t-tests were used to analyze the relationship between pretest and post-test knowledge scores. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants were single (76%), college educated (94%), and received EC at the clinic visit (60%). The average age was 24 years. Slightly over half (52%) reported drinking beer at least once a week, with one to six cans on occasion. Younger women expressed more tolerant attitudes toward alcohol use (p= .02) and drank significantly more beer on occasion (p= .015). Women who reported drinking alcohol when they last had sex were significantly (p= .017) less tolerant in their attitudes toward alcohol use. The intervention used in this study was effective in communicating knowledge about FASD to this population (p < .0001). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings suggest that young women may be engaging in behaviors that could put potential offspring at risk for exposure to alcohol. Clinicians are advised to take a thorough history to determine alcohol use in all women of childbearing age and to provide information regarding FASD prevention.

N2  - Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy may result in facial dysmorphism, growth retardation and central nervous system deficits. This has been found in infants ranging from fetal alcohol effects (FAE) to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), or alcohol related neurodevelopment disorders (ARND) and alcohol related birth defects (ARBD). In this study, we report a FAE case with orofacial cleft due to mother's alcohol use during her pregnancy. A 32-year-old Japanese woman, para2, gravida3. She was drinking alcohol while this pregnancy. At 39th week, a girl was delivered vaginally. Her birth weight is 3860gr. Apgar score is seven points at one minutes and eight points at 10 minutes. Orofacial cleft and sinus tachycardia were diagnosed postnatally. From a brain-computed tomography (CTscan), it showed a normal finding. Karyotype was normal female phenotype (46, XX). It is important to note that the obstetrician had to advise the women not to have alcohol use during pregnancy in order to prevent her baby from fetal alcohol effects or toxic effect of alcohol on the fetus.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The first descriptions in the modern medical literature of a distinctly recognizable pattern of malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse were reported in 1968 and 1973. Since that time, substantial progress has been made in developing specific criteria for defining and diagnosing this condition. Two sets of diagnostic criteria are now used most widely for evaluation of children with potential diagnoses in the FASD continuum, ie, the 1996 Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria and the Washington criteria. Although both approaches have improved the clinical delineation of FASD, both suffer from significant drawbacks in their practical application in pediatric practice. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to present specific clarifications of the 1996 IOM criteria for the diagnosis of FASD, to facilitate their practical application in clinical pediatric practice. METHODS: A large cohort of children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol were identified, through active case-ascertainment methods, in 6 Native American communities in the United States and 1 community in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The children and their families underwent standardized multidisciplinary evaluations, including a dysmorphology examination, developmental and neuropsychologic testing, and a structured maternal interview, which gathered data about prenatal drinking practices and other demographic and family information. Data for these subjects were analyzed, and revisions and clarifications of the existing IOM FASD diagnostic categories were formulated on the basis of the results. RESULTS: The revised IOM method defined accurately and completely the spectrum of disabilities among the children in our study. On the basis of this experience, we propose specific diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome and partial fetal alcohol syndrome. We also define alcohol-related birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder from a practical standpoint. CONCLUSIONS: The 1996 IOM criteria remain the most appropriate diagnostic approach for children prenatally exposed to alcohol. The proposed revisions presented here make these criteria applicable in clinical pediatric practice.

N2  - Elevated levels of fatty acid ethyl esters have been documented in the meconium of neonates born to heavily drinking mothers. Recently, accumulation of FAEE has been documented in the hair of drinking adults. To be able to use this test in the diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, one needs to establish baseline FAEE levels in infants born to nonalcoholic women because ethanol occurs in the baby naturally even without drinking. Scalp hair of 56 infants born to nonalcoholic women attending a well-baby clinic was obtained. Levels of FAEE were measured by GC-MS. FAEE were detected in almost all hair samples. Offspring of women admitting to mild, infrequent drinking did not differ in FAEE hair levels from infants of total abstainers. Baseline levels of FAEE in neonatal hair of nonalcoholic mothers have been established. Mild infrequent maternal drinking does not elevate these baseline levels. This may help avoid false-positive determinations when assessing infants born to problem drinking mothers. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Alcohol abuse is common among the population and results in significant diseases that shorten life span. Ethanol may result in chronic brain changes such as atrophy but may also result in neurologic disease that may be acute or chronic and sometimes life threatening. Accompanying vitamin deficiencies may lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy and changes in serum osmosis may lead to several acute demyelinating disorders. In addition, pregnant women who consume alcohol place their babies at high risk for the fetal alcohol syndrome. In this article we review these disorders and emphasize their imaging features.

N2  - Background. The adverse effects of alcohol on the developing human represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and behavioral and neurocognitive disabilities, most accurately termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The first descriptions in the modern medical literature of a distinctly recognizable pattern of malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse were reported in 1968 and 1973. Since that time, substantial progress has been made in developing specific criteria for defining and diagnosing this condition. Two sets of diagnostic criteria are now used most widely for evaluation of children with potential diagnoses in the FASD continuum, ie, the 1996 Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria and the Washington criteria. Although both approaches have improved the clinical delineation of FASD, both suffer from significant drawbacks in their practical application in pediatric practice. Objective. The purpose of this report is to present specific clarifications of the 1996 IOM criteria for the diagnosis of FASD, to facilitate their practical application in clinical pediatric practice. Methods. A large cohort of children who were prenatally exposed to alcohol were identified, through active case-ascertainment methods, in 6 Native American communities in the United States and 1 community in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The children and their families underwent standardized multidisciplinary evaluations, including a dysmorphology examination, developmental and neuropsychologic testing, and a structured maternal interview, which gathered data about prenatal drinking practices and other demographic and family information.

N2  - Background: Due to changing cultural norms, Latinas of childbearing age residing in the U.S. may be at increasing risk of drinking harmful levels of alcohol during pregnancy, and may also be unaware of the risks for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders associated with this behavior. We assessed the prevalence of alcohol consumption in a sample of low-income pregnant Latinas and examined risk factors for alcohol use in the periconceptional period. Methods: As part of a larger intervention trial, a cross-sectional in-home interview study was conducted among a sample of 100 pregnant low-income Latinas receiving services from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in San Diego County, California. Results: Fifty-seven percent of respondents indicated they were either life-time abstainers or had not consumed any alcohol in the periconceptional period. Forty-three percent reported some alcohol use in the three months prior to recognition of the current pregnancy, and 20% reported at least one binge episode of four or more standard drinks during that time frame. Five percent reported drinking seven or more drinks per week, and 8% continued drinking alcohol after recognition of pregnancy. Significant predictors of any alcohol use in the periconceptional period included English language/higher level of acculturation, younger maternal age, lower parity, higher level of education, younger age at first drink, and having ever smoked. Women who were aware of alcohol warning messages and /or had more knowledge of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) were significantly more likely to have consumed alcohol in the periconceptional period. Frequency of periconceptional use of alcohol did not differ between women who planned or did not plan the pregnancy. Conclusion: The prevalence and pattern of early pregnancy alcohol consumption in this sample of Latinas is similar to patterns noted in other race/ethnic groups in the U.S. Level of knowledge about FAS and awareness of warning messages was not protective for early pregnancy alcohol consumption, suggesting that specific knowledge was insufficient to prevent exposure or that other factors reinforce maintenance of alcohol consumption in early pregnancy. Selective interventions in low-income Latinas are warranted, and should be focused on women of reproductive age who are binge or frequent drinkers and who are at risk of becoming pregnant.

N2  - Alcohol drinking during pregnancy results in abnormal fetal development, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in humans and experimental animals. FAS is characterized by two major effects, including central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and multiple anomalies recognizable mainly as a typical face. However, the mechanisms of alcohol-induced embryotoxicity have not been clearly demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced FAS in the developing embryo. First, ethanol-induced developmental abnormalities were investigated in vitro. Postimplantation embryos at gestation day (GD) 9.5 were cultured for 48 h and observed for morphological changes. Ethanol-mediated changes in proteins regulated apoptosis (p53 and bcl-2), antioxidant (vitamin E and catalase) activities, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative DNA damage shown as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-O HdG) were measured in embryonic midbrain cells. Alcohol or acetaldehyde significantly induced cytotoxicity in cultured rat embryonic midbrain cells. The levels of p53, bcl-2, and 8-O HdG were concomitantly changed by alcohol and acetaldehyde treatment in midbrain cells. Injured cells induced by ROS were increased by alcohol or acetaldehyde treatment in midbrain cells. Cotreatment with alcohol or acetaldehyde and catalase decreased cytotoxicity in midbrain cells. In postimplantation embryo culture, alcohol or acetaldehyde-treated embryos showed retardation of embryonic growth and development in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that alcohol and its metabolite acetaldehyde induce fetal developmental abnormalities by disrupting cellular differentiation and growth. Data demonstrate that some antioxidants can partially protect against the alcohol-induced embryonic developmental toxicity. Copyright© Taylor & Francis Inc.

N2  - Factors that change sex hormone levels during pregnancy may have long-term health consequences for the offspring, including changes in breast cancer risk. A cross-sectional analysis of alcohol consumption and hormone levels in 339 pregnant women sampled from the Child Health and Development Study cohort was undertaken. Alcohol intake was queried from 1959 to 1966, long before any hazards of drinking during pregnancy were publicized. Third trimester serum hormone levels including estradiol and testosterone were analyzed. Among 339 pregnant women, 196 reported some alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The drinkers were divided into three groups with intake levels of 0.2-0.5, 0.6-2.0, and 2.1-12.5 ounces of ethanol per week. The second group corresponds to a median intake of ~2 drinks per week, and the last group corresponds to a median intake of ~1 drink per day, which is considered "light" to "moderate" drinking. Maternal estradiol levels were not associated with alcohol intake during pregnancy. However, serum testosterone was significantly lower, by 12.2%, in the latter two groups of drinking pregnant women, [confidence interval (CI) = -3.0 to 25.2] and 25.6% (CI = 9.2-39.5), respectively. The alcohol intakes reported are far below those shown to cause fetal alcohol syndrome, or any of the fetal alcohol effects so far studied. Light alcohol intake during pregnancy is associated with lower maternal testosterone. The health implications are uncertain, but may include an increased breast density in the daughters of drinking mothers. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Alcohol use among women of childbearing age is prevalent in the United States, with approximately 1 in 5 non-pregnant women reporting binge drinking (5 or more drinks on any one occasion) and 1 in 25 pregnant women reporting binge drinking. Alcohol use during pregnancy results in a spectrum of adverse outcomes known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of these disorders. Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by specific facial abnormalities and significant impairments in neurodevelopment and physical growth. Early identification of children with FAS has been shown to enhance their long-term outcomes. In an effort to improve clinical recognition of children with this condition, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was directed by Congress in 2002 to lead the development of uniform diagnostic criteria for FAS and other prenatal alcohol-related conditions. The purpose of this commentary is to provide clinicians a summary of the report released by CDC describing the current diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, advancements have been made in screening and brief interventions for alcohol use disorders in women who have the potential to make significant strides in the prevention of FAS spectrum disorders. Knowledge of the diagnostic criteria for FAS can lead to increased identification of the syndrome in infants and children and the provision of appropriate medical and support services. Screening for and intervening with women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy can prevent FAS and other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2005 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Children prenatally exposed to alcohol typically exhibit behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity, learning deficits, and an increased prevalence of depression. Similar impairments are found in children of hypothyroid mothers, and we have shown that alcohol-consuming rat dams have suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) function. Therefore, we hypothesized that suppressed maternal thyroid hormonal milieu may contribute to the deleterious consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. We aimed first to confirm and then to reverse the behavioral deficits in the fetal alcohol exposed (FAE) rat offspring by administration of thyroxine (T4) to the alcohol-consuming dams. Adult offspring prenatally exposed to ethanol (FAE; 35% ethanol-derived calories), pair-fed (PF) or control (C) diets were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM), the forced swim test (FST), and the open field test (OFT) to assess spatial learning, depressive behavior, and exploratory behavior/anxiety, respectively. Adult FAE offspring took longer to locate a hidden platform in the MWM and showed increased depressive behavior in the FST both of which were reversed by administration of T4 to the alcohol-consuming mother. We found sex and brain region-specific alterations in expression of genes involved in these behaviors in FAE adult offspring. Specifically, decreased hippocampal GAP-43 mRNA levels in adult FAE females and decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the amygdala of male and female FAE offspring were observed. The decreased mRNA levels of GAP-43 and GR were normalized by T4 treatment to the alcohol-consuming mother. Our results suggest that the suppressed HPT function of the alcohol-consuming mother contributes to the behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions observed in the offspring. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

N2  - Alcohol abuse in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranging from discreet developmental problems to fetal alcohol syndrome. That is why pregnant women and the women considering pregnancy should abstain from alcohol. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders occur even after drinking at early stages of pregnancy when women are not aware of being pregnant. According to one study 75% Czech women drank alcohol before pregnancy and one third of them continued during first three months of pregnancy. According to new epidemiological data 83,4 % of Czech women aged between 18 and 40 drank alcohol during the year preceeding the pregnancy. The prevention in this area in the Czech Republic is clearly not satisfactory, and it is complicated by the alcohol advertising targeted at women, low taxation of alcohol and other factors.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a second primary school cohort in a community in South Africa. Method: Active case ascertainment, two-tier screening, and Institute of Medicine assessment methodology were employed among 857 first grade pupils, most born in 1993. Characteristics of children with FAS were contrasted with characteristics of a randomly selected control group from the same classrooms. Physical growth and development, dysmorphology and psychological characteristics of the children and measures of maternal alcohol use and smoking were analyzed. Results: The rate of FAS found in this study is the highest yet reported in any overall community in the world, 65.2-74.2 per 1,000 children in the first grade population. These rates are 33-148 times greater than U.S. estimates and higher than in a previous cohort study in this same community (40.5-46.4 per 1,000). Detailed documentation of physical features indicates that FAS children in South Africa have characteristics similar to those elsewhere: poor growth and development, facial and limb dysmorphology, and lower intellectual functioning. Frequent, severe episodic drinking of beer and wine is common among mothers and fathers of FAS children. Their lives are characterized by serious familial, social and economic challenges, compared with controls. Heavy episodic maternal drinking is significantly associated with negative outcomes of children in the area of non-verbal intelligence but even more so in verbal intelligence, behavior and overall dysmorphology (physical anomalies). Significantly more FAS exists among children of women who were rural residents (odds ratio: 7.36, 95% confidence interval: 3.31-16.52), usually among workers on local farms. Conclusion: A high rate of FAS was documented in this community. Given social and economic similarities and racial admixture, we suspect that other communities in the Western Cape have rates that also are quite high.

N2  - Background: Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure can cause impairments even in the absence of gross morphological defects associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. The basal ganglia, which include the dopamine-rich striatum, are sensitive to fetal alcohol-induced injury. In this study, we manipulated the timing of moderate-level alcohol exposure and compared the risk of adverse effects on striatal dopamine (DA) system function in rhesus monkeys. Methods: Thirty-five young adult rhesus monkeys (Macaco mulatta) from four groups of females were assessed: (1) an early alcohol-exposed group (n = 9), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6 g/kg alcohol solution on gestational days O through 50; (2) a middle-to-late gestation alcohol-exposed group (n = 7), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6 g/kg alcohol solution on gestational days 50 through 135; (3) a continuous-exposure group (n = 9), in which mothers voluntarily consumed 0.6 g/kg alcohol solution on days O through 135; and (4) controls (n = 10), in which mothers voluntarily consumed an isocaloric control solution on gestational days O through 50,50 through 135, or 0 through 135. We studied striatal DA system function by positron emission tomography in separate scans for trapping of [18F]fallypride and 6-[18F]fluoro-m- tyrosine to assess striatal DA D2 receptor (D2R) binding and DA synthesis, respectively, via dopadecarboxylase activity. Results: Moderate-level alcohol exposure during early gestation and continuous exposure throughout gestation (early + middle-to-late exposure) reduced the striatal D2R binding to DA synthesis ratio, whereas middle-to-late alcohol gestation exposure increased the striatal D2R binding to DA synthesis ratio. The continuous-exposure group showed the largest effect. Moreover, the D2R binding/DA synthesis ratio was related to neonatal neurobehavior measures in control monkeys, but these relationships were disrupted in the fetal alcohol-exposed monkeys. Conclusion: These results suggest that the vulnerability of the DA system to the effects of moderate doses of alcohol during gestation depend on the timing of the alcohol exposure. Early-gestation moderate alcohol exposure resulted in a reduction or blunting of dopaminergic function in adulthood, whereas middle to late exposure (without early exposure) either induced the opposite pattern or heightened dopaminergic function. Continuously exposed monkeys showed the largest effect, suggesting that the sooner women stop drinking, the better it is for the fetus. Copyright © 2005 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objective: Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders are contributors to long-term learning disabilities. By using a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, we have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure results in adult learning deficits of unknown mechanisms. In the developing hippocampus, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2B triggers long-term potentiation, fundamental to learning and memory; this is supplemented by the less plastic NR2A subunit in the adult. To understand the mechanism of learning deficits in FAS, we evaluated NR2B and NR2A expression in embryonic and adult mice. Study design: Pregnant C57Bl6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol or control (saline solution). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 10 days, and brains from adult offspring were collected at 3 months (after evaluation for learning deficit). Calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for NR2B and NR2A with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance. Results: At 6 hours, NR2B expression in the alcohol-exposed embryos was higher than in controls (P < .01). NR2A was not expressed in either group. By 24 hours there was no difference in NR2B (P = .3). However, at 10 days NR2B was lower in alcohol-exposed animals (P = .02). In the adult brains there was a relative decrease in NR2B (P = .03) and an increase in NR2A (P < .01). Conclusion: Prenatal alcohol exposure during development induces NR2B expression deregulation in the embryos that persists until adulthood, when a relative increase in the less modifiable subunit NR2A occurs. This alteration in NMDA receptor subunits may underlie the learning abnormalities in fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Question: By the time women find out they are pregnant and see a family physician, they might have already consumed alcohol during the pregnancy and affected the development of their fetuses. How can family physicians better prevent exposure to alcohol during pregnancy? Answer: Women of childbearing age should be counseled about the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy before they become pregnant. Diagnosing children who have fetal alcohol spectrum disorders can help identify birth mothers who are at risk of other alcohol-exposed pregnancies and who need support to change their behaviour.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure results in fetal death and neurobehavioral complications including learning impairment. Previously synthetic peptides derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor have been shown to prevent aspects of alcohol-induced damage in pregnancy. The objective of this work was to evaluate whether activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 could prevent alcohol-induced damage in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Study design: Using a well-characterized model, C57Bl6/J mice on gestational day 8 were treated with placebo, alcohol (30% volume/volume alcohol 0.03 mL/kg), alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 30 minutes prior to alcohol, or activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 alone. Fetal death was assessed on gestational day 18 (25 litters were evaluated: alcohol, n = 5; placebo, n = 9; alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12, n = 11). Neonatal behavior tests were performed on postnatal days 1 through 21 with the offspring of 12 dams (alcohol, n = 16; placebo, n = 46; alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12, n = 23; and activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12, n = 35). Adult males were tested in the Morris water maze for learning assessment and with the hole punch activity test for exploratory activity. Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis and analysis of variance. Results: Fetal death was greater in alcohol (67% +/- 13%) vs placebo (8.4% +/- 3%, P<.001). Pretreatment with activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death (2.2% +/- 8.1%) with levels similar to control (P = .12). Alcohol exposure caused a delay in achieving developmental milestones, with alcohol achieving milestones later than all other groups (all P<.001). Pretreatment with activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 prevented the alcohol-induced milestone delays. In the Morris water maze, the placebo learned, decreasing their latency to find the hidden platform over 70% (P<.01). Alcohol plus activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 also significantly learned, with a learning curve not different from placebo (all P>.5) and significantly better than alcohol on days 4, 6, and 7 (all P<.05). Alcohol exposure resulted in significantly less time in hole punch activity (P<.02) than control. Activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 pretreatment prevented the alcohol-induced decline, with levels the same as control (P = .1). Conclusion: The novel peptide activity-dependent neurotrophic factor-12 prevents alcohol-induced fetal death and developmental and learning abnormalities in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. This demonstrates that a single treatment with a peptide is efficacious and may be of value in the prevention of alcohol-induced damage. © 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Executive functioning and working memory in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
A1  - Rasmussen C.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The goal of this report is to critically review research on executive functioning (EF) and working memory in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Individuals with FASD exhibit EF deficits in the areas of cognitive flexibility, planning and strategy use, verbal reasoning, some aspects of inhibition, set shifting, fluency, working memory, and, recently, on tests of emotion-related or hot EF. Some researchers have linked prenatal alcohol exposure to abnormalities in the development of the frontal cortex of affected individuals or animals. One common finding is that these EF deficits persist regardless of whether the individual has facial dysmorphology. Furthermore, EF deficits are not simply due to a low IQ in these individuals. More research with larger sample sizes, smaller age ranges, and consistent measurement tools is needed in this area to ameliorate some inconsistencies in the literature. Furthermore, researchers should now focus on studying the pattern of weakness in EF in individuals with FASD as well as relations among working memory and EF, which will help to identify specific areas of weakness, to enhance diagnosis, and to improve treatment. There is limited research on the development of EF in individuals with FASD, which can have important implications for understanding of how these deficits unfold from childhood through adulthood.

N2  - Maternal alcohol exposure results in a variety of neurodevelopmental abnormalities that include cognitive and sensorimotor dysfunctions that often persist into adulthood. Many reports of central nervous system disturbances associated within a clinical diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome point toward disturbances in central information processing. In this study, we used the rat barrel field cortex as a model system to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the organization and size of the large whisker representation in layer IV of the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF) in somatosensory cortex. Pregnant rats (Sprague-Dawley) were intragastrically gavaged daily with alcohol doses (6 gm/kg body weight) from gestational day 1 to day 20 in a chronic binge pattern which produced blood alcohol levels ranging between 260 mg/dl and 324 mg/dl. Chow-fed (CF), pair-fed (PF), and cross-foster (XF) groups served as normal, nutritionally matched, and maternal controls, respectively, for the ethanol-exposed (EtOH) treatment group. All pups were examined on gestational day 32 corresponding approximately to postnatal day 9. EtOH and control group pups were weighed, anesthetized, and perfused. Brains were removed and weighed, with and without cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, and the neocortex was removed and weighed. Cortices were then flattened, sectioned tangentially, and stained with a metabolic marker-cytochrome oxidase-to reveal the barrel field. A subset of 27 cortical barrels, associated with the representation of the large whisker pad, was selected to examine in detail. The major results were: (i) the total barrel field area comprising the PMBSF was significantly reduced in EtOH (by 17%) and XF (by 16%) pups compared with CF pups, (ii) the sizes of individual barrels within the PMBSF were also significantly reduced in EtOH (16%) and XF (18%) pups, (iii) the septal region between barrels was also significantly reduced in EtOH (18%) and XF (12%) pups, (iv) anteriorly located barrels underwent greater reduction in size relative to the posteriorly located barrels, (v) body weights were also significantly reduced in EtOH (21%) and XF (27%) pups, (vi) total brain weight [with and without (forebrain) cerebellum/olfactory bulbs] and cortical weights were also significantly reduced in EtOH (total brain weight 15%, forebrain weight 16%, cortical weight 15%) and XF (18%, 19%, 20%) pups, and in contrast (vi) neither the overall barrel field pattern nor the pattern of individual barrels in the PMBSF was altered. These findings suggest that PAE reduces body and brain weight as well as the central cortical representation of the whisker pad, while leaving the overall barrel field pattern unperturbed. While these results might appear to support a miniaturization hypothesis (smaller PMBSF, smaller brain, smaller body weight), PAE also shows regional vulnerability within the PMBSF whereby anteriorly located barrels are most affected. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Objective: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with cognitive, behavioral and social deficits, including delinquency. Although delinquent populations and those with intellectual and behavioral deficits exhibit impaired moral judgment and reasoning, this area remains unexplored in alcohol-exposed individuals. Method: Moral maturity and delinquency were evaluated in 27 participants with prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC group) and 29 nonexposed controls (CON group) matched on age (range: 10-18), gender, handedness, socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Moral maturity was evaluated using the Sociomoral Reflection Measure-Short Form, and delinquency was evaluated with the Conduct Disorder (CD) Questionnaire. Additional measures included social desirability and inhibition. Results: The ALC group performed at a lower level of moral maturity than the CON group. Whereas Verbal IQ primarily predicted this difference, a deficit on the moral value judgment having to do with relationships with others was specific to prenatal alcohol exposure. Furthermore, delinquency was higher in the ALC group, and specific sociomoral values were predictive of delinquent behavior. Finally, half of the children and adolescents with a history of prenatal alcohol exposure but without fetal alcohol syndrome had probable CD. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that interventions aimed at reducing delinquency in those with prenatal alcohol exposure are necessary, and targeting moral judgment for this purpose may be beneficial.

N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and associated disorders resulting from maternal alcohol use during gestation are among the most common developmental disorders. However, they are rarely diagnosed and not fully understood in terms of their behavioral and neurocognitive phenorype. Prenatal exposure leads to alterations in facial morphology, growth, and neurocognition. The nature and extent of teratogenic effects on the brain and the relationship between such effects and observed behaviors remain in debate because there are no established markers for the neurological effects of exposure. In this study, we examined the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on white-matter integrity in the corpus callosum by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and herein describe the relationship between such effects and observed physical and behavioral outcomes. Methods: DTI was used to evaluate diffusion anisotropy in the genu and splenium of corpus callosum in 16 low-income, primarily African-American volunteers. Volunteers were recruited from a cohort of young adults who had received neuropsychological evaluations during adolescence. Nine had been prenatally exposed to alcohol and had characteristics of FAS, and seven were nonexposed controls. Results: Significant difference in the means for diffusion fractional anisotropy (t = 2.26, df = 9, p < 0.002) and apparent diffusion coefficient (t = 2.14, df = 14, p < 0.008) were observed in the corpus callosum of alcohol-exposed youth compared with nonexposed youth. No significant differences were found in intracranial volume between these groups. Conclusions: Our results illustrate that DTI can be used in evaluating the integrity of corpus callosum in alcohol-exposed individuals. If future studies support these findings, diffusion anisotropy, represented by fractional anisotropy, has the potential to be used as a clinical marker in the diagnosis of FAS.

N2  - Background: Since chronic alcohol use suppresses the adult immune system, we tested the hypothesis that maternal alcohol ingestion increases the risk of infection in term newborns. Methods: Analysis of a large case-control study of birth weight for gestational age was performed focusing on maternal alcohol ingestion and the development of infection in term newborns > 36 weeks gestation. After delivery, mothers were asked about alcohol and tobacco use in the 3 months prior to conception, the 1st, 2nd, and 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. Results: Eight hundred and seventy-two singleton newborns (872) > 36 weeks gestation were identified for analysis. A total of 51 (5.8%) had newborn infections. Gestational age, sex, and small for gestational age (SGA) were similar in the newborns with and without infection (p = NS). Infants whose mothers reported alcohol use, excessive drinking or smoking in pregnancy were more likely to have a newborn diagnosed with an infection than were mothers who reported abstaining from alcohol or cigarettes (p < 0.05). When controlling for race and smoking, SGA infants whose mothers used any alcohol had a 2.5-fold increase risk of infection, while excessive alcohol use increased the risk 3-4-fold. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for low maternal income, smoking, and SGA, excessive alcohol use during the 2nd trimester increased the risk of newborn infection (OR 3.7 [1.1,12.8], p < 0.05). Conclusions: Excessive maternal alcohol use is associated with an increased risk of newborn infection in this patient sample. Increased awareness and further clinical investigations are warranted to address the detrimental effects of fetal alcohol exposure on the developing immune system.

N2  - Objectives. We defined risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a region with the highest documented prevalence of FAS in the world. Methods. We compared mothers of 53 first-grade students with FAS (cases) with 116 randomly selected mothers of first-grade students without FAS (controls). Results. Differences between case and control mothers in our study population existed regarding socioeconomic status, religiosity, education, gravidity, parity, and marital status. Mothers of children with FAS came from alcohol-abusing families in which heavy drinking was almost universal; control mothers drank little to no alcohol. Current and past alcohol use by case mothers was characterized by heavy binge drinking on weekends, with no reduction of use during pregnancy in 87% of the mothers. Twenty percent of control mothers drank during pregnancy, a rate that declined to 12.7% by the third trimester. The percentage who smoked during pregnancy was higher for case mothers than for control mothers (75.5% vs 30.3%), but the number of cigarettes smoked was low among case mothers. The incidence of FAS in offspring of relatively young women (28 years) was not explained by early drinking onset or years of drinking (mean, 7.6 years among case mothers). In addition to traditional FAS risk factors, case mothers were smaller in height, weight, head circumference, and body mass index, all anthropomorphic measures that indicate poor nutrition and second-generation fetal alcohol exposure. Conclusions. Preventive interventions are needed to address maternal risk factors for FAS.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Clinical reports indicate a poor quality of life (QOL) among individuals with FASD; however, QOL has not been formally assessed and reported in this population. We describe psychosocial and QOL assessment scores among 11 women with FASD. These women had poor QOL scores and high levels of mental health disorders and behavioral problems relative to standardization samples and other at-risk populations. We suggest that psychiatric distress may play a substantial role in the reduced quality of life reported among adults with FASD.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: An overview with emphasis on changes in brain and behavior
A1  - Riley E.P.
A1  - McGee C.L.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders constitute a major public health problem. This article presents an overview of important issues that surround these disorders and emphasizes the structural and neurobehavioral consequences associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol. Diagnostic criteria are discussed, and possible moderating factors for the range of outcomes are mentioned. In addition, the prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is described, and estimates of the financial impact of these disorders are given. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure can severely affect the physical and neurobehavioral development of a child. Autopsy and brain imaging studies indicate reductions and abnormalities in overall brain size and shape, specifically in structures such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. A wide range of neuropsychological deficits have been found in children prenatally exposed to alcohol, including deficits in visuospatial functioning, verbal and nonverbal learning, attention, and executive functioning. These children also exhibit a variety of behavioral problems that can further affect their daily functioning. Children exposed to alcohol prenatally, with and without the physical features of fetal alcohol syndrome, display qualitatively similar deficits. Determining the behavioral phenotypes that result from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is critical, because the identification of these children is crucial for early interventions. In addition, knowing which brain areas are involved might enable the development of better intervention strategies. However, intervention needs to go beyond the affected individual to prevent future cases. As evidenced by the staggering financial impact these disorders have on society, prevention efforts need to be aimed at high-risk groups, and this issue needs to be made a high priority in terms of public health.

N2  - Background: Alcohol exposure during the fetal stage generates variable severity in different organs, as seen in fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect. Whether genetic factors or conditions of alcohol exposure influence the susceptibility to alcohol-related developmental impairment remains a question. Methods: To investigate the contribution of genotype to the susceptibility to alcohol-induced toxicity during development beyond confounding maternal factors and variables of alcohol exposures, the authors tested the effect of alcohol exposure under definitive concentration using a whole embryonic culture of two inbred strains previously known to be vulnerable (C57BL/6 [C6]) or resistant (DBA/2 [D2]) to alcohol. On gestational day 8, embryos from each group bearing three to six somites were collected and then cultured for 44 hr in a medium added with 400 mg/dl of ethanol. The viability and morphological malformations, as well as developmental staging of the embryos, were all scored at the end of the culture. Results: The authors found, in contrast to previous reports, that alcohol treatment retarded embryonic growth and induced abnormalities, including the neural tube opening and the hypoplasia of the optic vesicle in both strains. However, alcohol specifically compromised the heart and caudal neural tube in C6, whereas it specifically decreased the number of somites and the development of branchial bars among others in D2. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that both strains of embryos are vulnerable to the same amount and pattern of alcohol exposures at the same developmental stage, but each with unique vulnerability in specific organs, with alcohol having greater teratogenic effects in D2 than in C6. These differential vulnerabilities are results of greater genetic influence, rather than the maternal influence or conditions of alcohol. Copyright © 2005 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Background: A broad range of attentional and neuropsychological impairments have been demonstrated in children with fetal alcohol exposure. This study was designed to investigate which specific aspects of attentional function are most directly affected by moderate to heavy doses of prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: A total of 337 black children who were aged 7.5 years and recruited prospectively to overrepresent prenatal alcohol exposure at moderate to heavy levels were assessed on a diverse battery of neuropsychological tests. Principal components analyses were used to replicate and extend Mirsky et al.'s (1991) four-component model of attention. The relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to empirically derived attentional constructs was examined. Results: Both the replicated and the extended attentional models produced solutions similar to the original Mirsky et al. model, reflecting elements of encode (working memory), shift, and focused and sustained attention, as well as a distinct component reflecting impulsivity. Adverse effects of maternal drinking across pregnancy were found primarily for working memory, and these effects were exacerbated when mothers were aged 30 or older at the time of the child's birth. Conclusions: These data confirm previous studies using diverse methods that suggest that working memory may be the most important aspect of attention that is adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can induce a wide spectrum of adverse effects in offspring. Microcephaly and mental retardation are two major defects of central nervous system (CNS). Most mechanism studies of alcohol-related CNS defects have been focused on the morphologically abnormal tissues, and more attention has been paid to nuclear alteration as opposed to organelle development. METHODS: A mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was used to investigate the effect of alcohol on fetal cerebral mitochondria development. Pregnant mice were given different doses of ethanol intragastrically from GD6 to GD15. Fetal cerebral mitochondria were isolated and analyzed on GD18. RESULTS: Excessive cell apoptosis was found in the cerebra of prenatal alcohol exposure fetuses. Proliferation and differentiation of fetal cerebral mitochondria were inhibited by alcohol. Affected mitochondrial volume constriction and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) accumulation, reduced activities of respiratory chain complex I and IV and ATP synthase were detected in the cerebral tissue without obvious malformed appearance. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired mitochondria development plays a role in the CNS defects induced by prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can frequently lead to a congenital disorder known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS); however, not all children born to alcoholic women develop FAS. Alcohol consumption may affect diverse organs and systems during embryonic development, including craniofacial structures. Small teeth, enamel alterations, and delayed eruption have been observed after ethanol exposure. Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGF-Rs) participate in dental proliferation and differentiation, and changes in these receptors were considered here to be a likely mechanism associated to the dental anomalies observed in this syndrome. Epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (EGF-R) and epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (erbB-2) immunoexpression during the lower first molar morphogenesis was investigated in mouse fetuses exposed to ethanol during gestation. METHODS: Pregnant female mice were divided into groups, consuming either 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25% ethanol solutions, or water (control group). Heads were obtained from 16.5- and 18.5-day fetuses. Immunohistochemistry was applied to EGF-R and erbB-2. RESULTS: At days 16.5 and 18.5, fetuses from 15%, 20%, and 25% ethanol groups showed delayed differentiation, degenerative changes in dental epithelial tissues and reduced dental size; additionally, they displayed an enhanced immunoreactivity to EGF-R and erbB-2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ethanol consumption during pregnancy affects the expression of EGF receptors and induces a delay in murine fetal dental morphogenesis. Dental development is a process that involves a number of growth factors; hence we consider that further research is required to show whether the changes in glycosylation and growth-factor signaling pathways observed in other cells are also involved in the alterations observed in this study. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) are often diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These children show increases in reaction time (RT) variability and false alarms on choice reaction time (CRT) tasks. In this study, adult rats prenatally exposed to ethanol were trained to perform a CRT task. An analysis of the distribution of RTs obtained from the CRT task found that rats with a history of prenatal ethanol exposure had more variable RT distributions, possibly because of lapses of attention. In addition, it was found that, similar to children with FASD, the ethanol-exposed rats had more false alarms. Thus, rats with prenatal ethanol exposure show attention deficits that are similar to those of children with FASD and ADHD.

N2  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), the strongest manifestation of FASD, results in short stature, microcephally and facial dysmorphogenesis including microphthalmia. Using Xenopus embryos as a model developmental system, we show that ethanol exposure recapitulates many aspects of FAS, including a shortened rostro-caudal axis, microcephally and microphthalmia. Temporal analysis revealed that Xenopus embryos are most sensitive to ethanol exposure between late blastula and early/mid gastrula stages. This window of sensitivity overlaps with the formation and early function of the embryonic organizer, Spemann's organizer. Molecular analysis revealed that ethanol exposure of embryos induces changes in the domains and levels of organizer-specific gene expression, identifying Spemann's organizer as an early target of ethanol. Ethanol also induces a defect in convergent extension movements that delays gastrulation movements and may affect the overall length. We show that mechanistically, ethanol is antagonistic to retinol (Vitamin A) and retinal conversion to retinoic acid, and that the organizer is active in retinoic acid signaling during early gastrulation. The model suggests that FASD is induced in part by an ethanol-dependent reduction in retinoic acid levels that are necessary for the normal function of Spemann's organizer. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Inner-city, black women are among those groups that are at higher risk for having infants with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders that can include life-long neurobehavioral and cognitive impairments. Chronic alcohol consumption can decrease amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a fatty acid that is essential for optimal infant neural and retinal development in a variety of tissues. Methods: Black women who presented at an inner-city antenatal clinic for their first prenatal visit were recruited into a longitudinal, observational study. Alcohol intake was determined by a structured interview. Participants provided blood specimens and completed food frequency surveys at 24 weeks of gestation, infant delivery, and 3 months postpartum. Fatty acid composition analyses were completed on 307, 260, and 243 for plasma and 278, 261, and 242 erythrocyte specimens at 24 weeks of gestation, delivery, and 3 months postpartum, respectively. Results: Proportion of drinking days at the first prenatal visit was associated with decreased DHA in plasma and erythrocytes throughout the study. This association was the strongest at 24 weeks of gestation. In addition, an interaction between proportion of drinking days at the time of conception and ounces of absolute alcohol per drinking day at the time of conception was detected and demonstrated that, in daily drinkers, high intakes of alcohol are associated with decreased DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations in plasma. Conclusions: Frequent and high intakes of alcohol that have been previously associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are also associated with decreased maternal DHA and AA plasma concentrations. The present findings indicate that maternal DHA deficiency is associated with high-risk drinking and may contribute to the mechanism(s) of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

T1  - Alcohol consumption among women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant--United States, 2002
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with health problems that adversely affect the mother and fetus; no level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been determined safe. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is recognized as the foremost preventable condition involving neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities. Women who drink during pregnancy place themselves at risk for having a child with FAS or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To determine the alcohol consumption patterns among all women of childbearing age, including those who are pregnant or might become pregnant, CDC analyzed data for women aged 18-44 years from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. The results of that analysis indicated that approximately 10% of pregnant women used alcohol, and approximately 2% engaged in binge drinking or frequent use of alcohol. The results further indicated that more than half of women who did not use birth control (and therefore might become pregnant) reported alcohol use and 12.4% reported binge drinking. Women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant should abstain from alcohol use.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) consists of multi-system abnormalities and is caused by the excessive intake of alcohol during pregnancy. The teratogenic effect of alcohol on humans has now been established beyond reasonable doubt and FAS is one of the most important human teratogenic conditions known today. Many investigators have catalogued, quantified and refined these hallmarks of FAS over the years and have established that the most consistent consequences of heavy maternal drinking during pregnancy are prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and brain and craniofacial abnormalities. Many practitioners are unable to recognise the often subtle features associated with FAS and fail to diagnose it. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and discuss the relevance of FAS to clinical dental practice.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy causes a major risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). This article defines the three syndromes linked to alcohol consumption during pregnancy: (1) FAS, with or without confirmed maternal alcohol exposure; (2) alcohol-related birth defect (ARBD) (3) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). The article also reviews data on alcohol use in pregnant women and in women of child-bearing age. The literature indicates that between 6% and 45% pregnant women have an at-risk alcohol use, and suggests that brief counseling interventions designed to prevent at-risk alcohol use are effective. Studies assessing alcohol use and brief intervention efficacy in pregnant women in Switzerland are needed.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Many of these affected children show retarded physical growth in the postnatal period despite adequate nutrition. On the basis of findings from studies with animals, it has been proposed that this is due to allometric retardation of growth of skeletal muscle, although the exact reasons for this are not known. The aim of the current study was to examine the structural changes in skeletal muscle in fetal alcohol syndrome in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of growth retardation in fetal alcohol syndrome. Chick embryos were exposed to single doses of 5%, 10%, and 15% ethanol, and the effects on the general growth and development, as well as on the skeletal muscle, of these chicks were studied. There was a significant retardation in crown rump length, head circumference, and body weight in ethanol-exposed chicks when these parameters were compared with findings for appropriate control groups. This retardation was associated with significant and proportionate reductions in the weights of skeletal muscles. Microscopic examination of skeletal muscle showed areas of neutrophil infiltration and necrosis, suggestive of muscle damage, in chicks exposed to 10% and 15% ethanol. Thus, findings of the current study demonstrate the direct toxic effects of a single dose of ethanol on developing embryos in general and skeletal muscle in particular. The pathologic changes seen in skeletal muscle could account for the failure in postnatal growth in fetal alcohol syndrome. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: National initiatives on fetal alcohol syndrome in Canada and the United States aimed at prevention, identification, and treatment of individuals who are affected by alcohol exposure in utero recommend that women abstain from consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Health care providers are key educators regarding appropriate alcohol use. The objective of this study was to describe characteristics of physicians who recommend alcohol abstinence during pregnancy with regard to knowledge of fetal alcohol syndrome and preconception counseling strategies. Methods: A survey was mailed to Canadian physicians and midwives between 2001 and 2002. Participants consisted of a national random sample of 1090 Canadian obstetricians and gynecologists, midwives, and family physicians who were current members of provincial and national professional organizations. The main outcome measure was questionnaire responses to knowledge, prevention, and diagnosis of issues related to alcohol use during pregnancy. Results: Response rates ranged from 31.1% among family physicians to 63.5% among midwives. Overall, 91.2% of providers recommended abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. These providers were significantly more likely to believe that there is sufficient information about alcohol use and that clients were interested in discussing alcohol (p < 0.05). They were also significantly more likely to discuss depression, personal alcohol use, partner's use of alcohol, and family history of alcohol misuse with women of childbearing age (p < 0.05). Once a patient became pregnant, fewer practice differences were noted, although those who recommended alcohol abstinence were significantly more likely to take clinical action when pregnant patients were consuming moderate amounts of alcohol (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It is encouraging that almost 90% of Canadian health care providers recommend abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. However, differences in clinical practice exist between providers who recommend alcohol abstinence during pregnancy as compared with those who recommend a "glass in moderation".

N2  - Background: In contrast to the extensive literature documenting IQ deficits in patients with fetal alcohol syndrome, effects on IQ have not generally been reported for children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). This study examined the role of maternal age, MAST, and quality of parenting in moderating the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the WISC-III IQ test in moderate-to-heavily exposed children. Methods: A total of 337 inner-city African American children whose mothers were recruited prenatally were administered the WISC-III at 7.5 years. Alcohol exposure was assesed with a timeline follow-back interview administered at every prenatal clinic visit. Moderating effects of the three risk factors were examined by adding interaction terms to regression analyses and dichotomizing the moderators and performing separate regressions on the two groups. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was related to WISC-III Freedom from Distractibility but not to Full Scale IQ for the sample as a whole. However, among children born to older mothers, an alcohol effect emerged on Full Scale IQ and five of seven composite IQ scores. Similarly, adverse effects were seen among children of MAST-positive mothers and children whose parents provided less optimal cognitive stimulation. Each additional ounce of absolute alcohol consumed per day during pregnancy was associated with a 2.9-point decrease in Full Scale IQ and a 5.6-point decrement on Freedom from Distractibility. Conclusions: This study is the first to demonstrate IQ effects among children with ARND born to older and MAST-positive mothers, particularly in relation to first-trimester drinking. These findings suggest that there are subgroups of more vulnerable and severely affected children whose intellectual performance is compromised. A moderate- to heavy-drinking mother who has given birth to an unaffected child when she was younger needs to be warned that her risk of having an adversely affected child increases as she grows older.

N2  - Aims: To determine the alcohol exposure and pharmacokinetics of alcohol in a group of women who had given birth to children wit FAS, compared with women who had not given birth to FAS children. Methods: 10 women who had given birth to FAS children (FAS mothers) and 20 Controls were studied to determine how they metabolize alcohol in a single limited-access quasi-experimental session of voluntary consumption of alcohol. They had free choice in the consumption of any amount of their favourite beverage for ~2.5 h, but their drinking was terminated if the breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) exceeded 150 mg%. BrACs was measured during ethanol consumption and for several hours after, for estimation of alcohol exposure and pharmacokinetics. Results: FAS mothers consumed significantly larger amounts of alcohol, and achieved significantly higher peak BrAC levels than Controls. The rate of decline of alcohol from the circulation (beta-60) showed a 2-fold variation across subjects but there was no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions: This study did not show any difference in alcohol pharmacokinetics in free-choice drinking by non-pregnant women, who either have given or have never given birth to FAS children. However, mothers of FAS children tend to consume more alcohol per session. Future studies in larger samples will be needed to confirm these findings and to examine drinking patterns and other factors that may increase the risk of FAS in children of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. © Medical Council on Alcohol 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in morphological abnormalities in the fetuses of humans and experimental animals, and is referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, the molecular mechanism underlying FAS has not been completely elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced FAS in the developing embryo and fetus. cDNA microarray analysis was used to screen for altered gene profiles. Ethanol at a teratogenic dosage (3.8 g/kg, twice a day) was administered intraperitoneally to pregnant C57BI/6J mice from gestation day (GD) 6 to 8. Morphologic observations showed excessive malformations of the craniofacial regions (reduction of the face, the absence of eyes, nose, jaw, and mandible, underdevelopment of vibrissae areas, cleft lip, and palate) in ethanol-exposed embryos (GD 10) and fetusus (GD 75). cDNA microarray analysis showed alterations in several gene profiles, including the "palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone (plunc)," "neurofilament," and "pale ear." Of these genes, the expressions of plunc were confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and whole-mount in situ hybridization. The plunc was highly expressed in the craniofacial region, specifically in upper airways and nasopharyngeal epithelium. RT-PCR analysis revealed that normal plunc mRNA expression levels were present in GD 75 fetuses, but not in GD 10 embryos. Interestingly, ethanol significantly downregulated the plunc expression in GD 75 fetuses. Our results suggest that ethanol-induced FAS is due in part to the downregulation of plunc expression in the fetus, and this gene may be a candidate biological marker for FAS.

N2  - Alcohol-related pathologies lead to most serious expressions, both at clinical and social level. The diffused social acceptance of consumption and abuse behavior and the lack of alcohol education for professionals (physicians, psychologists, social workers etc.) make difficult to put in the right frame this issue. Just a multidimensional approach can make the problem understandable. The history of alcohol consumption during the time gives us an exhaustive picture of the negative consequences of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a problem still underestimated and represents a serious risk for the health of the newborns: children alcohol-exposed in uterus are at risk to develop many pathologies and even the fetal-alcohol syndrome (FAS) that leads to facial anomalies, growth deficiencies and neurological damages. Therefore interventions coping with this kind of issues are needed in order to enhance people's health.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome prevention in Washington State: Evidence of success
A1  - Astley S.J.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a permanent birth defect syndrome caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. It is characterised by growth deficiency, central nervous system damage/dysfunction, and a unique cluster of minor facial anomalies. To assess the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts, one must be able to estimate accurately the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome over time in population-based samples. With the establishment of the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network of clinics, the development of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Facial Photographic Analysis Software, the creation of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the establishment of the Foster Care Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Screening Program, and the collection of Pregnancy Risk Assessment Management System data on maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy, the tools, methods and infrastructure for assessing the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome primary prevention efforts in Washington State are in place. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine whether the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among children in a foster care population, born between 1993 and 1998, decreased with the documented decrease in prevalence of maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy from 1993 and 1998 in Washington State. The prevalence of maternal drinking during pregnancy in Washington State declined significantly (P < 0.001) from 1993 to 1998 as did the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among foster children born 1993-98 (P < 0.03). These observations support the likelihood that fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts in Washington State are working successfully.

T1  - Implicit strategy affects learning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Roebuck-Spencer T.M.
A1  - Mattson S.N.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Learning and memory deficits are commonly reported in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Our recent work suggested that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure retained information as well as controls on a verbal learning test but not on a test of nonverbal learning and memory. To better understand the cause of this differential pattern of performance, the current study re-analyzed data from our previous study to determine if the presence of an implicit learning strategy may account, at least in part, for the finding of spared retention. Methods: The current study examined verbal learning and memory abilities in 35 children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and 34 nonexposed controls (CON) matched for age (9-16 years), sex, ethnicity, handedness, and socioeconomic status. Groups were compared on two measures of verbal learning, one with an implicit strategy (California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version; CVLT-C) and one without (Verbal Learning subtest of the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning; VL-WRAML). Results: Children with FASD learned less information overall than children in the CON group. Both groups learned a greater percentage of information and reached a learning plateau earlier on the CVLT-C compared with the VL-WRAML. Groups also showed comparable rates of retention after a delay on the CVLT-C. In contrast, on the VL-WRAML, children with FASD showed poorer retention rates than children in the CON group. Interestingly, children with FASD did not differ from children in the CON group on CVLT-C semantic clustering scores for learning trials 1 through 3, and greater utilization of semantic clustering was correlated with better learning and memory performance in both groups. This overall pattern of results was not related to overall intellectual level. Conclusions: The finding of spared retention of verbal information on the CVLT-C in our earlier studies may be related to test characteristics of the CVLT-C rather than a finding of spared verbal retention per se, given that spared retention was not found on a separate test of verbal learning and memory without an implicit learning strategy. These results suggest that the use of an implicit strategy positively affected the ability of alcohol-exposed children to learn and retain new verbal information.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a group of clinical features which appears in the fetus after prenatal alcohol exposure. It is a well known fact that alcohol is the most frequent teratogenic agent, and that its effects can be prevented, should alcoholic intake be avoided during pregnancy. Physical, neurologic and behavioral anomalies can show even after low doses. We try to update in this paper the diagnostic criteria of FAS, to point out the main aspects of alcohol metabolism, its relationship with the placenta and the possible mechanisms of its teratogenic action. We report the clinical features of 13 patients diagnosed at our institution during the last 15 years.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - We compared the rate of all-cause mortality in siblings of children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) with the siblings of matched controls. The siblings of children with FAS had increased mortality (11.4%) compared with matched controls (2.0%), a 530% increase in mortality. The age of death in case siblings deaths occurred later (between 1 day and 7 years) compared with the controls (1 day to 4 years) [odds ratio (OR) = 2.4 (0.4-15.6)]. Siblings of children with FAS had increased risk of death due to infectious illness [OR = 13.7 (1.2-361)] and sudden infant death syndrome compared with controls [OR = 10.2 (1.2-75.1)]. A diagnosis of FAS is an important risk marker for mortality in the siblings of the proband even if they do not have FAS. Maternal alcoholism appears to be a useful risk marker for increased mortality risk in diagnosed cases and their siblings. This has important implications in the management of family members of children with FAS.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which may increase the risk of confinement in the corrections system. In the United States each state and four major cities' corrections systems were asked to complete a questionnaire on the prevalence of FAS and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) in the offender population, the availability of screening and diagnostic services to identify offenders with FAS and staff training needs related to FAS. The total population in the 54 entities was 3 080904 inmates. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 42 entities (78%). The mean rate of reported substance abuse in offenders was 60.1%. Specialized programs for persons with mental retardation were reported for 44.4% of corrections facilities and 25.9% of community corrections facilities. Programs for pregnant women were reported for 46.3% of corrections facilities and 29.6% of community facilities. One program (1.9%) reported having a screening program for FAS in the corrections system. Only four programs (7.4%) reported having access to diagnostic services for FAS in the corrections facilities. Of the 3 080 904 offenders, only one offender was reported to have a diagnosis of FAS. Reported staff training needs were very large. In conclusion, corrections systems have high unmet needs to screen, identify, and treat offenders with FAS and ARND. Staff training needs are substantial.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes long-term serotonin neuron deficit in mice
A1  - Sari Y.
A1  - Zhou F.C.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Previous work from this laboratory showed that prenatal alcohol exposure at approximately 100 mg/dl from embryonic day (E)7 to early midgestation reduced the number and retarded the migration of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the raphe nuclei in C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we report that the deficit of 5-HT neurons found in midgestation persisted on E18 and into young adulthood. Methods: Pregnant dams were treated from E7 to E18 in three groups-(1) the alcohol group, fed with liquid diet with 25% ethanol-derived calories; (2) the isocaloric pair-fed group; and (3) the chow group for analysis of concentrations of active caspase-3-to study apoptosis at E18 in the brainstem and the number of 5-HT neurons at E18 and postnatal day 45. The concentrations of active caspase-3 were determined by using a colorimetric assay, and the 5-HT neurons were determined by immunocytochemistry. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure increased the concentration of active caspase-3 in the brainstem and caused reductions in brain weight by 20% and in the total number of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei by 20% at E18 as compared with those of the pair-fed and chow controls. Continuous observation from prenatal to postnatal stages showed that the reduction of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei persisted in the young adult stage. Conclusions: Upon prenatal alcohol exposure, an increased concentration of active caspase-3 and a decreased number of 5-HT-immunostaining neurons in the brainstem were observed at E18. The decreased number of 5-HT neurons persisted to the young adult stage of postnatal day 45. This suggests that ethanol has a long-lasting effect on 5-HT deficit. A fetal alcohol exposure-rendered lasting deficit of 5-HT and other transmitter systems may underlie the neuropsychiatric deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

A1  - Mahmood A.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Alcohol consumption by pregnant animals and humans leads to general growth impairment in their offspring, delayed growth and multiple birth defects collectively called "Fetal Alcohol Syndrome". In utero exposure of ethanol to rat pups causes damage to their developing intestinal epithelium which leads to impairment of nutrient assimilation and growth retardation during postnatal development. Aim To determine the effect of prenatal exposure of ethanol on the postnatal development of rat intestinal Na+-dependent and independent D-glucose transporter along with the amino acids (glycine and L-leucine) transporter activity at 4, 8, 14, 20 and 30 days of postnatal age. The changes in the expression levels of Na +-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1) mRNA was assessed at different days of postnatal age in rat pups. Methods: Wistar strain albino female rats were fed ethanol at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight/day orally by Ryle's tube for one month before mating and during the entire period of gestation while the control females received isocaloric glucose. Transport studies were performed using the everted intestine of 4, 8, 14, 20 and 30 day-old control and ethanol-exposed pups employing the tissue accumulation method. The expression of SGLT1 mRNA at different days of postnatal age in control and ethanol-exposed rat pups was determined using a Northern Blot analysis. Results: Prenatal exposure of ethanol to rat pups leads to a decrease in their body weight, intestinal length and weight and reduces the uptake capacities of SGLT1 as well as energy dependent glycine and L-leucine transporters with respect to their age-matched controls. However, the mRNA levels of SGLT1 remained unaltered in the ethanol-exposed pups at all ages of postnatal development compared to their controls. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in utero exposure to ethanol leads to a general delay in the postnatal development of the intestine of ethanol-exposed rat pups affecting mainly the development of intestinal energy dependent D-glucose and amino acid (glycine and L-leucine) transporters.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The classic clinical criteria for the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) include a "characteristic" facial appearance, pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, mental retardation, and occasional major malformations. However, diagnostic constraints, especially in the newborn period, lead to an underestimate of their prevalence. We report an epidemiological study of the potential risk of congenital defects in the offspring of mothers who ingested different sporadic and daily amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. METHODS: The study was based on the data from the ECEMC hospital-based case-control study and surveillance system, with a methodology aimed not only at the surveillance of congenital anomalies, but also at investigating their characteristics, clustering, and causes. For the purposes of this study, we considered as exposed those infants whose mothers reported the ingestion of any amount of alcohol during gestation (4705 mothers of cases and 4329 mothers of controls), and classified them into five groups according to their levels of alcohol consumption. Two groups consisted of mothers who consumed increasing sporadic levels and the other three consisted of mothers who consumed increasing daily levels of alcohol. RESULTS: Our study showed that even low sporadic doses of alcohol consumption during pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital anomalies in the offspring and that this risk increases with increasing levels of alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that it is necessary to generalize the preventive norm and recommend complete abstinence from alcohol during gestation. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Fetal, Infant, and Child Mortality in a Context of Alcohol Use
A1  - Burd L.
A1  - Wilson H.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Alcohol is an important element in the causal chain of risk for fetal, infant, and childhood mortality. Mortality risk is influenced by interactions of alcohol with other environmental and genetic factors and temporal periods of susceptibility. In this paper we discuss four time periods (preconceptual, gestational, infancy, and childhood) where alcohol use may create a context of risk. Alcohol use in one period increases the risk of alcohol use in subsequent periods. Gestational alcohol use can influence risk of mortality from abuse of mother/fetus, can cause other adverse outcomes, and can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In infancy alcohol use can increase risk from impairment of arousal in adults who use alcohol. Infants with gestational exposure can be behaviorally difficult with sleep disturbance, irritability, and colic. This can increase the risk of harm or death, especially during periods of caretakers' alcohol use. Caretakers' alcohol use and smoking are strongly correlated. The all-cause mortality rate in people diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is over 5%. All-cause mortality in siblings of diagnosed cases of FAS is increased 530% compared to siblings of matched controls. We recommend that a context of alcohol use be considered as a marker for multifactorial risk in all fetal, infant, and child deaths. A schema to collect data on alcohol use is provided to increase awareness of alcohol use as an environmental risk marker for mortality. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common identifiable teratogenic cause of mental retardation, neurological deficit, mental disorders, and developmental disabilities. Accurate estimates of the cost of care for persons with FAS are essential for appropriate funding of health care, developmental disabilities services, special education, and other service systems, as well as prioritizing funding of public health prevention efforts. The cost of care for individuals with FAS can be conceptualized as the annual cost of care for one person or a population, or as the lifetime cost of care for an individual. Annual cost estimates for the United States range from $75 million in 1984 to $4.0 billion in 1998. Estimates of lifetime cost vary from $596,000 in 1980 to $1.4 million in 1988. After adjustments for changes in inflation and population, 2002 estimates of total annual cost and lifetime cost are higher. FAS is increasingly being recognized as a large public health problem with high potential for the prevention of future cases and for the prevention of excess disability and premature mortality in persons who are affected. Each day, from 6-22 infants with FAS are born in the United States, and as many as 87-103 more are born with other impairments resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Updated and improved cost data on FAS should be a research priority. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Recognition of Facial Features of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in the Newborn

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The diagnosis of an infant, especially a newborn, with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is difficult due to the fact that not all of the features are apparent at that time. Many cases are also missed due to inadequate knowledge of the mother's drinking pattern and because of the examining physician's lack of experience with the disorder. While conducting a study of the use of maternal blood markers to determine alcohol use in pregnancy, we have evaluated systematically the effects of alcohol on the newborn infant. We have developed a facial scoring system consisting of six of the features commonly seen in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and present preliminary data about its use. By using a cutoff of four or more of these six features, there is a significant correlation with the presence of these features and the mother's self-reported alcohol use. In addition, there has been no significant difference in the frequency of positive scores between newborns of Caucasian or Black ancestry. We propose that this system may be useful in the assessment of newborn infants at high risk because of alcohol exposure during pregnancy. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Data were obtained from three samples of women of childbearing age. One sample of women is from prenatal clinics serving Plains Indian women. The second sample is of women from the Plains whose children were referred to special diagnostic developmental clinics, as their children were believed to have developmental issues consistent with prenatal alcohol consumption. The third sample is of women from South Africa, each of whom has given birth to a child diagnosed with full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Data across samples conform to expected trends on many variables. For example, the maternal age at time of pregnancy, a major risk factor for FAS, ranged from a mean of 23.5 years for the prenatal clinic sample, to 23.8 years for the developmental clinic sample, to 27.6 for the sample of women who have delivered children with FAS. Other variables of maternal risk for FAS expected from the extant literature, such as high gravidity and parity, binge drinking, heavy intergenerational drinking in the mother's extended family and immediate social network, and length of drinking career, were compared across the three samples with variable results. However, normative measures of drinking problems are unreliable when reported across cultures. An unexpected finding from this three-sample comparison was the differential risk found when comparing U.S. women to South African women. Women in the U.S. Plains Indian samples report a high consumption of alcohol in a binge pattern of drinking, yet there is less detectable damage to the fetus than among the South African women. Body mass index (BMI) and lifelong and current nutrition may have a substantial impact, along with the above factors, in relative risk for an FAS birth. The level of risk for producing a child with FAS is influenced by environmental and behavioral conditions that vary between populations and among individual women. Also, because many syndromes are genetically based, there is a need for full behavioral and genetic histories of the mother, family, and child being studied. Collecting extensive behavioral information as well as genetic histories will provide the requisite information for making an accurate diagnosis of FAS. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy is a leading, preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States, with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) being one of the most severe outcomes. Current survey statistics find that approximately one in eight pregnant women (500,000 per year) report alcohol use, with approximately 80,000 reporting binge drinking. While annual rates have fluctuated, trends analysis finds that there has been no significant change in rates of prenatal alcohol exposure over the past 10-year period. Development of effective programs to prevent FAS and to monitor the success of prevention efforts requires epidemiological data systems to inform these activities. This article describes alcohol use patterns among childbearing-age women and data sources that can be used in monitoring this behavior.

N2  - The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a "Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health Disparities 2002: A Call to Arms," on December 5, 2002, in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. This workshop was part of the NIAAA/NIH comprehensive strategic plan to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities. Eleven topics were addressed: (1) biomedical risk factors that may contribute to disparities in the toxic effects of alcohol; (2) alcohol and gene-environment interactions that affect the health of diverse groups; (3) alcohol pharmacogenetics in Mexican-Americans; (4) determinants of risk for alcoholism in minority populations; (5) consideration of population groups in linkage-disequilibrium studies to identify genes associated with alcohol dependence; (6) interaction between alcohol dependence and African-American ethnicity in disordered sleep, nocturnal cytokines, and immunity; (7) disparities of brain functional reserve capacity affecting brain morbidity related to substance abuse; (8) alcohol and pregnancy disparities; (9) role of alcohol in cancer risk disparities; (10) ethnic diversity in alcoholic cardiomyopathy; and (11) postmenopausal health disparities. On the basis of these presentations, seven conclusions emerged: (1) Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes exist in various populations. (2) These enzymes play a role in the variation in health effect outcomes seen in different populations, owing to alcohol consumption. (3) Differences between and among population groups can be critically important for the design and interpretation of studies in genetics. These include differences in expression of phenotype, in locus heterogeneity, in risk alleles, and in population structure. (4) Incidence rates for fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are greater in African-Americans and Native-Americans than in Caucasians. Genetic polymorphisms, nutrition, and other factors may account for these differences. (5) The highest mortality rate for cirrhosis has been found in white Hispanic men. (6) Mexican-Americans have a low frequency of the protective alleles ADH1B*2 and ALDH2*2 and a relatively high frequency of CYP2E1 c2, which is associated with early onset alcoholism. (7) The incidence rate for cancer is greater for African-Americans than for Caucasians, and part of the higher risk may be attributed to heavier drinking. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Maternal prenatal alcohol use is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities. On the severe end of the spectrum of conditions related to drinking during pregnancy is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Physicians and other health practitioners play a critical role in diagnosing FAS and in screening women of childbearing age for alcohol use during pregnancy. The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Team at CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities awarded funds to four medical school partners (Meharry and Morehouse Medical Colleges, St. Louis University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and the University of California at Los Angeles) to develop FAS regional training centers (RTCs). The RTCs are developing, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating educational curricula for medical and allied health students and practitioners that incorporate evidence-based diagnostic guidelines for FAS and other prenatal alcohol-related disorders. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background: This study investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on learning and memory in 14-year-old adolescents. The Children's Memory Scale was used to assess learning and memory function in the verbal/auditory and visual/spatial domains. In addition, both short- and long-term memory function were assessed. Methods: Data were collected as part of the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project, a longitudinal study including 580 children and their mothers. Women were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy and with their children from birth to 16 years of age. At age 14, memory function was evaluated using the Children's Memory Scale, an assessment tool that measures learning and immediate and delayed memory function in the verbal and visual-spatial domains. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure during the first trimester predicted deficits in learning, short-term memory, and long-term memory, specifically in the verbal domain. Deficits in performance were specific to learning and memory of word-pairs. In addition, deficits in memory were mediated by learning performance. Conclusions: Results demonstrated that prenatal alcohol exposure lead to deficits in encoding processes as indicated by deficits in verbal learning. Initial deficits in acquisition were responsible for deficits in immediate and delayed recall of verbal information in children who were exposed to alcohol during pregnancy but did not have fetal alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - In Australia the issue of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has not been the subject of policy development or of extensive research. There is a lack of knowledge, both in the general community and by health professionals, of the nature of the risks associated with heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the factors that increase this risk. This paper reviews the literature surrounding FAS with the aim of providing the reader an understanding of the diagnostic features and epidemiology of FAS and of the developmental sequelae associated with this syndrome.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Health care providers can more effectively prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and prenatal alcohol exposure if they know more about mothers who have children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or some characteristics of FAS. METHODS: We conducted two retrospective case-control studies of Northern Plains Indian children with FAS and some characteristics of FAS diagnosed from 1981 to 1993 by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71. We compared mothers who had children with FAS or some characteristics of FAS with mothers who had children that did not have FAS. RESULTS: Compared with control mothers, 43 mothers who had children with FAS and 35 mothers who had children with some characteristics of FAS were older, had fewer prenatal visits, more pregnancies, more mental health problems, and more injuries (both total and alcohol-related). Although the prevalence of drinking was high in both case and control mothers, case mothers had more alcohol-related medical problems, drank heavily, in binges, and daily more often than control mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Women with injuries and mental health problems should be screened for substance use. Mothers of children with FAS or of some characteristics of FAS have numerous needs that must be addressed to prevent future prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Because alcohol is a known teratogenic substance that negatively affects the fetus, screening for alcohol use is included in maternal child texts for nurses. They present no standard screening approach, however. In the general literature, a multitude of screening instruments exist for the purpose of detecting maternal alcohol dependence but few allow the nurse to detect fetal alcohol exposure in the absence of maternal alcohol dependence. After a comparative analysis of existing screening instruments, we concluded that the Timeline Followback method has the most utility as a screening instrument to detect fetal exposure to alcohol. The purpose of this article is to present a critical review of current screening instruments related to alcohol consumption in pregnant women and to propose the use of the Timeline Followback method as the preferred approach.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome--South Africa, 2001
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities. The FAS phenotype is characterized by a combination of facial dysmorphic features, growth retardation, and central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. State-based estimates of the prevalence of FAS in the United States vary from 0.3 to 1.5 per 1,000 live-born infants. Recently, the highest prevalence of FAS worldwide was reported among first-grade children in a wine-growing region in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Investigators for the National Institutes of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) reported a FAS prevalence of 40.5 to 46.4 per 1,000 children aged 5-9 years in one community in Western Cape. To determine whether FAS was associated exclusively with the wine-growing region in Western Cape or was more endemic in other areas of the country, CDC, in collaboration with the University of Witwatersrand and the Foundation for Alcohol Related Research in Johannesburg, South Africa, conducted a prevalence study in Gauteng province and is developing ongoing surveillance and prevention activities. This report summarizes the findings of the study, which indicate a high prevalence of FAS among first-grade children in four nonwine-growing communities around Johannesburg. Because South Africa has limited resources and many competing health problems (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases), integrating prenatal alcohol-exposure prevention activities with existing prevention programs should be explored.

T1  - Motivational intervention to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies--Florida, Texas, and Virginia, 1997-2001
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol use is a threat to healthy pregnancy outcomes for many U.S. women. During 1999, approximately 500,000 pregnant women reported having one or more drinks during the preceding month, and approximately 130,000 reported having seven or more alcohol drinks per week or engaging in binge drinking (i.e., five or more drinks in a day). These heavier drinking patterns have been associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (ARND). Lower levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., fewer than seven drinks per week) also have been associated with measurable effects on children's development and behavior. Although the majority of women reduce their alcohol use substantially when they realize they are pregnant, a large proportion do not realize they are pregnant until well into the first trimester and, therefore, might continue to drink alcohol during this critical period of fetal development. To reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies, CDC initiated a multisite pilot study (phase I clinical trial) in 1997 to investigate the use of a dual intervention focused on both alcohol-use reduction and effective contraception among childbearing-aged women at high risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (Project CHOICES). This report describes the association between baseline drinking measures and the success women have achieved in reducing their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. The analysis compares the impact of the motivational intervention at 6-month follow-up on women drinking at high-, medium-, and low-risk drinking levels. The findings indicate that although 69% of the women in the study reduced their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, women with the lowest baseline drinking measures achieved the highest rates of outcome success, primarily by choosing effective contraception and, secondarily, by reducing alcohol use. Women with higher baseline drinking measures chose both approaches equally but achieved lower success rates for reducing their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial of the motivational intervention is under way to further investigate outcomes of the phase I study.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an integrated review of the literature on fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), focusing on the definition of FAS/FAE, their incidence and related problems, gestational research findings, FAS symptoms, the effects of prenatal alcohol consumption on offspring over time, and FAS/FAE preventive measures. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches of MEDLINE and Web sites, as well as reference lists from published articles on FAS/FAE from 1973 to present. STUDY SELECTION: Literature was chosen from refereed journals and from current publications of the National Organization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using keywords relevant to FAS and FAS prevention. DATA SYNTHESIS: The consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can harm the fetus irreparably. Preventive measures can be helpful in decreasing or stopping the use of alcohol during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol is a definite teratogen. The amount of alcohol, if any, that can be safely consumed during pregnancy, the exact physiological mechanisms that make alcohol unsafe for the fetus, and the most effective prevention measures have yet to be identified. FAS/FAE is still increasing in the United States.

N2  - Background: Health care providers can more effectively prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and prenatal alcohol exposure if they know more about mothers who have children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or some characteristics of FAS. Methods: We conducted two retrospective case-control studies of Northern Plains Indian children with FAS and some characteristics of FAS diagnosed from 1981 to 1993 by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71. We compared mothers who had children with FAS or some characteristics of FAS with mothers who had children that did not have FAS. Results: Compared with control mothers, 43 mothers who had children with FAS and 35 mothers who had children with some characteristics of FAS were older, had fewer prenatal visits, more pregnancies, more mental health problems, and more injuries (both total and alcohol-related). Although the prevalence of drinking was high in both case and control mothers, case mothers had more alcohol-related medical problems, drank heavily, in binges, and daily more often than control mothers. Conclusions: Women with injuries and mental health problems should be screened for substance use. Mothers of children with FAS or of some characteristics of FAS have numerous needs that must be addressed to prevent future prenatal alcohol exposure.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Objective: The present study had two aims: (1) to examine the prevalence rates of prenatal alcohol consumption in a group of women participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in Southern California, with special emphasis on Hispanic women, and (2) to identify variables associated with postconception drinking in low-income minority women. Method: The study employed a cross-sectional survey that assessed alcohol use rates, demographic variables, and alcohol risk status. Participants were 826 pregnant women enrolled in the Public Health Foundation Enterprises (PHFE) WIC Program in Los Angeles and Orange counties, California. Pregnant women who enrolled self-administered a specially designed alcohol screener. Results: Findings were that 24% of sample women were consuming alcohol post conception. Of that percentage, approximately two thirds drank prior to pregnancy recognition, and one third continued to drink after pregnancy was confirmed. Approximately 30% of white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic and English-speaking Hispanic women were found to drink post conception compared with 15.8% of Spanish-speaking Hispanic women. This finding supported recent research that suggests more acculturated Hispanic women tend to incorporate the drinking patterns of the larger U.S. population to a greater extent than less acculturated Hispanic women. Although a number of demographic variables differentiated women who were abstinent from those who were postconception drinkers, the best predictor of postconception alcohol consumption was the woman's high-risk drinking score as measured by the TWEAK (sensitivity = 70.1%, specificity = 88.5%). Conclusions: Results suggest the importance of screening low-income minority pregnant women in a community setting so that interventions can be initiated to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and related conditions.

T1  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and ADHD: Diagnostic implications and therapeutic consequences
A1  - O'Malley K.D.
A1  - Storoz L.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The first association between prenatal alcohol exposure and a teratogenic effect in the developing fetus was made in 1968 by pediatrician Paul Lemoine in France. A few years later, Jones and Smith defined the fetal alcohol syndrome which combined dysmorphic facial, growth and CNS features. The classic fetal alcohol syndrome has been recently reviewed. Current research is beginning to acknowledge that exposure to differing levels of prenatal alcohol cause a spectrum of clinical conditions which can be grouped under the umbrella term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. There are three subtypes to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: full fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome (where there is only partial facial dysmorphology) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (where there is no facial dysmorphology and often absence of growth features). The term alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder is gradually replacing the older term fetal alcohol effects. These subtypes were initially described by Stratton and colleagues in 1996. It is also becoming clearer that the full fetal alcohol syndrome as originally described by Jones and Smith, and diagnosed in dysmorphic clinics, is the least common clinical subtype resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. In addition, current and ongoing research on brain structure, shape and function indicates that the brain abnormality is not correlated with the facial dysmorphology or intelligence quotient. Therefore, the presence of full fetal alcohol syndrome does not necessarily mean that the patient has the most severe CNS impairments. Genetic research has suggested that genetic factors may have a role in a modulating a woman's susceptibility to having a baby with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (specifically the full fetal alcohol syndrome subtype). Thus, genetic factors may increase the variability of the teratogenic effect of prenatal exposure to alcohol on the developing fetus.

T1  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on infant mental development: A meta-analytical review

A1  - Das Eiden R.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Aims: Although research on fetal alcohol exposure has had a significant effect on social norms and public policy, there has been little quantitative review of this literature. Methods: Meta-analysis was used to examine the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on infant mental development, assessed using the Mental Development Index (MDI) from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, a widely used, standardized measure. The current study examined the effects of three levels of average daily exposure during pregnancy: less than 1 drink per day, 1-1.99 drinks per day and 2 or more drinks per day. Analyses were conducted separately for effects derived from observations of 6-8-, 12-13- and 18-26-month-old children. Results: Fetal alcohol exposure at all three dosage levels was associated with significantly lower MDI scores among 12-13-month-olds. The effect was attenuated, but not eliminated, when effect sizes adjusted for relevant covariates were used. For younger and older children, the effect of fetal alcohol exposure did not attain statistical significance at any dosage level. Conclusions: This pattern of results may reflect differences in MDI item content at different ages and the differential sensitivity of these abilities to prenatal alcohol exposure. Because the body of relevant literature is neither large nor conclusive, and because of heterogeneity in measurement, analysis and samples, caution is urged in interpreting results. Future research would benefit from use of more specific measures of infant outcomes and consideration of the impact of relevant covariates, different dosage patterns and timing of drinking on infant mental development.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The aims of the study were, first, to perform a comprehensive assessment of neurocognitive status in early adolescence of children exposed to alcohol prenatally; and, second, to examine whether duration of exposure continues to be predictive of outcome at this age. Twenty-seven exposed 12-14-year-olds and 39 non-exposed 13-14-year-olds underwent neuropsychological assessments (WISC-III, NEPSY subtests) of attention and executive functions, language, visuomotor functions, and memory. The group of non-exposed children was used to develop preliminary test norms for the 13-14-year-old exposed children whereas published test norms could be used for the 12-year-olds. The results demonstrated neurocognitive impairment across all types of tasks. Impairment varied in degree according to the duration of alcohol exposure. Children exposed throughout pregnancy, most of who had diagnoses of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) or Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE), performed well below the average range. It was concluded that the neurocognitive effects of alcohol exposure tend to be widespread and generalized. Attention and executive functions do not seem to be selectively affected. Further, the relationship between duration of prenatal alcohol exposure and neurocognitive development continues to be significant in early adolescence.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - We employed a computerized (virtual) Morris water task (VMWT) to measure place learning and cued-navigation in eight adolescent males (9.5-16.5 years old) diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Eight adolescent males matched for age and ethnicity with no history of prenatal alcohol exposure served as controls. Participants were trained to navigate to a hidden platform in a fixed location relative to a set of four conspicuous extramaze cues. After 20 hidden platform trials, a single no-platform probe trial was conducted, followed by 8 trials during which the platform was visible (cued-navigation). The FAS group traveled further than controls to navigate to the hidden platform during training. During the probe trial, controls navigated more directly to the platform region and persisted in searching where the platform had been more than the FAS group. Cued-navigation was comparable in both groups, suggesting that group differences in place learning were not attributable to visual-motor or motivational deficits in the FAS subjects. This pattern of impaired place learning and spared cued-navigation is similar to that reported in rats exposed to ethanol during periods of prenatal or early postnatal brain growth, as well as in animals with hippocampal damage. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) display altered performance in tasks of learning and memory, behaviours thought to be associated with the hippocampus. Altered hippocampal structure has been reported in some FAS children; therefore, a rat model system was used to determine whether the size and numbers of pyramidal cells in regions CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampal formation and granule cells in the dentate gyrus were altered by alcohol exposure during different periods of development. Rat pups were exposed to alcohol in utero during the second trimester-equivalent (E10-20), the first two trimesters-equivalent (E1-20), during the time of hippocampal pyramidal cell neurogenesis (E16-20), part of the third trimester-equivalent (P4-9), and all three trimesters-equivalent (E1-20+P4-9). Control animals (nutritional and untreated) were reared for all treatment conditions. All pups were perfused on P10. CA1 volume, pyramidal cell density, and number were reduced in pups treated with alcohol during the third trimester-equivalent, whether unique or as exposure during all three trimesters-equivalent. CA3 volume was reduced in alcohol-treated animals across all gestational ages; however, pyramidal cell density and number in this region were only reduced in animals treated with alcohol during the third trimester-equivalent. Volume of the dentate gyrus did not appear to be affected by alcohol treatment. Granule cell density and number in this region were reduced in animals treated with alcohol during the third trimester-equivalent. The third trimester-equivalent in the rat appears to be a developmental period during which the hippocampus is particularly susceptible to the effects of alcohol consumption. The resulting damage to the hippocampus may contribute to the behavioural deficits related to learning and memory noted in children with FAS. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background and Objective: The fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is considered as the main preventable cause of congenital defects and mental deficiency. We analyzed whether the consumption of alcohol during gestation has changed in Spain. Subjects and Method: We analyzed the evolution over the last 24 years, as well as the geographical distribution according to Spanish regions, of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. We used data from the ECEMC, a registry which includes 1,820,862 liveborns, of whom 30,836 were malformed. A similar number of healthy controls was collected. We established 5 increasing levels of alcohol consumption, for sporadic and diary intakes, and 3 levels of maternal scholarship. Results: Except for the lowest and highest intakes, alcohol consumption levels showed a decreasing trend over the time. These tendencies were similar in almost all Spanish regions. When comparing the intake between regions, the differences were statistically significant. There was a correlation between the maternal scholarship and the alcohol intake, showing that the higher the education the lower the amount of alcohol consumption. Conclusions: The awareness of the alcohol effects is related to the maternal cultural level. Maternal consumption of alcohol varies across Spanish regions, though its trends are similar.

N2  - Background: Although the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) varies within the population, few data are available concerning variation in the prevalence of prenatal drinking. Methods: Postpartum women delivering singleton infants at two Atlanta hospitals in 1993 or 1994 were interviewed. Those delivering infants who were small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 638) were over-sampled relative to those delivering infants with birth weights that were appropriate for gestational age (AGA) (n = 247). The prevalence of prenatal drinking was estimated as a weighted average of reports from mothers of SGA and AGA infants. Estimates of the prevalence of FAS come from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: The prevalence of first-trimester drinking was half that reported for the three previous months (private hospital: 72% vs. 35%; public hospital: 52% vs. 28%). Most women (85%) reported abstaining throughout the second trimester. Fewer than 10% of women delivering at the public hospital (7.5%), but one-quarter of those delivering at the private hospital, reported third-trimester drinking. Binge, moderate and heavy drinking in pregnancy were more common among women delivering at the public hospital. Eight infants born at the public hospital during this period, but none of those born at the private hospital, were identified as possibly having FAS; four of the eight were identified as probably having FAS. Conclusions: These results have implications for health education programs. For example, obstetricians in private practice may wish to reaffirm their advice to abstain from drinking in the third trimester. They also suggest that prenatal abstinence programs be targeted at populations identified as most likely to engage in risky drinking.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a major public health issue that is evident on an international scale. The current article summarizes a meeting that was held in Valencia, Spain, in September 2001, that reviewed ongoing international collaborations and the prospects for new collaborative research. The attendees represented nine different countries and many different specialties. Following overviews of existing international collaborations in South Africa, Russia, and Chile, a number of topics for future work were discussed. Issues related to the diagnosis of FAS, its prevalence and how measures might be enhanced and standardized were presented, as obtaining consistency across populations is of prime importance. Another session discussed the current state of basic research and how collaborations in this area might be initiated. The neurobehavioral profile of FAS and how work in this area could be advanced and interpreted in light of findings with different populations generated considerable discussion. There was a review of brain imaging data in FAS and how this might be utilized in assisting the diagnosis of FAS and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). A presentation on the utilization of international collaborations in defining the role of genetics in the etiology of FAS was included. Finally, issues related to the prevention of FAS and how these issues might be modified based upon different populations were presented. International collaborations provide a wealth of resources for the study of FAS, and it was hoped that this meeting might better enhance the work ongoing in this area, and provide opportunities for future work.

T1  - Biochemical markers of alcohol use in pregnant women
A1  - Cook J.D.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Objectives. To describe the serious health consequences of alcohol (ethanol) use, especially as they relate to pregnancy and the development of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE). The classic markers of alcohol exposure, including blood/breath alcohol, -glutamyl transferase (GT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hemoglobin-associated acetaldehyde (HAA) and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), are valuable and their methods of analysis are reviewed. Conclusions. Since both FAS and FAE represent two of the leading preventable causes of mental retardation and birth defects, identification of alcohol use early in pregnancy is important to avoid adverse fetal outcomes. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of FAS and FAE is usually made after birth, when alcohol damage has become irreversible and permanent. The clinical laboratory can help prevent this damage and make a valuable contribution in assessing prenatal alcohol use. The clinical utility of blood/breath alcohol, GT, MCV, HAA and CDT in alcohol use identification, especially in pregnancy, is substantial. Although none of the markers singularly has adequate sensitivity and specificity for screening, their diagnostic utility increases when measured as a panel. This is especially true in detecting alcohol use in pregnancy where the presence of several positive markers was correlated with the presence of alcohol-related fetal effects. © 2002 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Verbal Learning deficits have been reported following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). This study examined verbal and visual multitrial learning in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) and controls matched on age and gender from the same community. In this study, the FAS/FAE group's immediate memory on the Verbal Learning and Visual Learning tasks from the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML) was significantly weaker than that of the control group. Although the FAS/FAE group also recalled significantly less information after a delay, they did retain an equivalent proportion of the visual and verbal information as compared to the control group. Thus, the overall pattern of performance on both verbal and visual measures was consistent with that observed in previous studies of Verbal Learning: despite weaker learning, the FAS/FAE group's relative retention of information was no different than that of controls. © 2002 National Academy of Neuropsychology.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), and alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorders (ARNDs) in neonates are often the result of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Facial characteristics are associated with FAS, but ARBDs and ARNDs are more difficult to diagnose. Fetal exposure to alcohol can cause central nervous system dysfunction, pre- and postnatal growth problems, cardiac defects in neonates, and attention deficit disorders and mental retardation in older children. To date, diagnosis of fetal alcohol effect has depended largely on maternal interview, although clinical tests are becoming more widely used. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are formed in the body by esterification of ethanol with free fatty acids and trans-esterification of glycerides and have been detected in the meconium of newborns. This report estimates the prevalence of fetal alcohol exposure in two populations by detecting FAEEs in meconium. Methods: We analyzed the prevalence of FAEEs in the meconium of two separate groups of neonates by use of solid-phase extraction and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the chemical ionization mode. In the first study, meconium samples were taken anonymously from babies born in a large, regional perinatal center in Hawaii. In the second study, specimens were obtained from infants admitted to six different newborn intensive care units within the state of Utah. Results: In the first study, 73 of 436 (16.7%) meconium specimens tested were considered positive for FAEEs. When broken down into quartiles, the mean total FAEEs measured were 1059, 3133, 6628, and 62115 ng/g. In the second study, 35 of 289 (12.1%) specimens were considered positive. When broken into quartiles, the mean total FAEEs were 1139, 3067, 7674, and 50 143 ng/g. The overall FAEE profiles of the two study sets were remarkably similar. Conclusion: In an adequate meconium specimen, a total FAEE concentration >10 000 ng/g may indicate that the newborn has been exposed to significant amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. © 2003 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure is an important cause of growth impairment. In this study we examined the stability of the growth measurements, including height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) percentiles, from birth to age at the time of diagnosis for subjects who were referred for evaluation to determine if they had fetal alcohol syndrome. Methods: We utilized subjects from the North Dakota Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Registry. Each person referred for assessment was provided a standardized assessment completed by a medical geneticist. We also examined differences in the diagnostic schema from the Institute of Medicine. The population consisted of 315 subjects with paired weight measurements, 234 subjects with paired height measurements, and 322 subjects with current BMI measurements. Results: Increases in weight percentiles and decreases in height percentiles were found. Children with FAS had consistently lower growth measurements. There was significant movement in and out of lower 5th and 10th percentiles by partial and no FAS children from birth to diagnosis. Discussion: The requirement for growth impairment needs to be broad rather than narrow, if most subjects with a diagnosis of FAS and partial FAS/ARND are to be captured. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common cause of developmental disability, neuropsychiatric impairment and birth defects. The disorder is identified by the presence of growth impairment, central nervous system dysfunction, and a characteristic pattern of craniofacial features. The reported prevalence of the disorder varies widely and recent estimates approach 1% of live births. Expression of these features varies by age. People with FAS have high rates of comorbid conditions: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (40%), mental retardation (15-20%), learning disorders (25%), speech and language disorders (30%), sensory impairment (30%), cerebral palsy (4%), epilepsy (8-10%). Birth defects are common. In the United States, the annual birth cohort of persons with FAS could be as high as 39,000 cases annually. Cause-specific mortality is 6% for patients with FAS. The disorder is expensive to treat and most patients have lifelong impairment. The annual cost of care in the United States would approach US$5.0 billion. Early recognition and entry into appropriate treatment programs appear to improve outcome. Prevention efforts should involve screening for alcohol use prior to pregnancy and at the first prenatal care visit. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Four-State FAS Consortium: Model for program implementation and data collection
A1  - Struck J.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The Four-State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Consortium on the Studies of the Prevention of FAS is an effort to bring together resources, both human and material, across the states of Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota to decrease the prevalence of births affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Beginning in September 2000, the Consortium received 3 years of funding and operates through a cooperative agreement with funding from the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Three primary objectives are addressed through the Consortium structure. These include: to develop and evaluate the formation of the Consortium itself; to develop an information base that systematizes data collection that helps determine populations and areas considered high risk; and to implement and test a scientific-based prevention/intervention model for women considered high risk of abusing alcohol during their childbearing years. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction. The microdeletion 22q11.2 affects 1/4000 live births and constitutes the most frequent interstitial chromosomal alteration in humans. It is involved in a heterogeneous series of phenotypic expressions. Aims. To determine the most important clinical characteristics in a series of patients with this genetic-molecular disorder. Patients and methods. We conducted a retrospective study of 16 patients who had been diagnosed, by means ofFISHorPCR, as having microdeletion 22q11.2, and the following data were evaluated in a protocolised manner: sex, age, family background, characteristics of the pregnancy, birth, neonatal and post-neonatal periods, clinical and semiological data, as well as the results from the complementary explorations carried out according to the predominant pathology. Results. The age at which the diagnosis was made oscillated between newly born and 8 years, with a predominance of males overfemales in a ratio of 3.2/1. In all, 81% of patients presented neurological disorders. Brain malformations were seen in six, hypoplasia of the anguli oris muscle in five, congenital facial palsy in three-which was associated with brain malformations in one patient-, retarded neurodevelopment in six cases and neurogenic arthrogryposis in one. Other findings such as congenital heart disease (75%), skeletal disorders (37%), peculiar phenotypes (31%), nephrourological disorders (19%) and hypoacusis (19%) constitute significant manifestations of the process. Some of the most noteworthy occasional events include retarded height and weight development, hypocalcemia and cleft palate. In one case involving a child whose mother suffered from chronic alcoholism, there were both phenotypic traits of this entity and offoetal alcohol syndrome at the same time. In four of the patients the FISH teehnique did not detect the deletion, which was confirmed by a technique involving DNA amplification with PCR. Conclusions. The presence of central and peripheral neurological alterations, together with cardiac, skeletal, renal and auditory disorders was confirmed, as was the existence of neurodevelopmental retardation and a peculiar phenotype. Both the frequency and the kind of disorder coincided with what has been described earlier. A number of facts stand out owing to their novelty. These include the high incidence of asymmetric crying facies, the existence ofdata compatible with foetal alcohol syndrome in one of the patients with this clinical entity, and the association with neurogenic arthrogryposis in another, which are circumstances that suggest the possibility of a causal relation with the deletion 22q11.2. Using DNA amplification with PCR is seen to be of greater diagnostic efficacy than the FISH technique.

N2  - Background. Significant interindividual variability exists following maternal alcohol consumption; not all children born to alcoholic women manifest the symptoms associated with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Objective. To investigate the potential role of the placenta as a source of variability by determining if interindividual variability exists in the binding of acetaldehyde to human placenta. Methods. Acetaldehyde was added to ten different human placental homogenates and subjected to equilibrium dialysis. Homogenates of placentae obtained from guinea pigs chronically exposed to ethanol throughout gestation were also dialysed in the presence of acetaldehyde to look for alterations in binding after chronic alcohol exposure. Nonlinear least-squares regression analysis was used to characterize the binding system involved. Results. It was found that the amount of acetaldehyde bound to human placentae varied by as much as 3-fold among placentae. The binding profile of acetaldehyde was characterized as a two site binding system (Ka1 = 9.8 x 105 +/- 0.7 x 105 l/mol, N1 = 1.1 x 10-8 +/- 0.7 x 10-8 mol/g tissue; Ka2 = 1.6 x 104 +/- 0.9 x 104 l/mol, N2 = 1.7 x 10-7 +/- 0.4 x 10-7 mol/g tissue). Chronic alcohol exposure had no effect on the degree of acetaldehyde binding. Conclusion. This previously unidentified source of variability may partially explain why some foetuses are adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure while others are not. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and type 2 diabetes occur with high incidence in the same populations and both are associated with autonomic neuropathies. The authors have recently shown that hepatic parasympathetic neuropathy results in insulin resistance of skeletal muscle. The authors tested the hypothesis that fetal ethanol exposure (FEE) results in hepatic insulin sensitizing substance (HISS)-dependent insulin resistance (HDIR) in the adult offspring of rats. The parasympathetic nerves normally provide a permissive signal to the liver, allowing insulin to cause the release of HISS, which stimulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Blockade of the neural signal prevents HISS release, and a state of HDIR ensues, whereby the response to insulin is reduced by 50 to 60% in the fed state. The rapid insulin sensitivity test (RIST), a transient euglycemic clamp, was used. The RIST index is the amount (mg) of glucose per kg of body weight required to maintain euglycemia following a bolus of insulin (50 mU/kg). Adult male offspring of dams who received ethanol through the maternal drinking water, throughout gestation and nursing, showed ethanol dose-related HDIR. The control RIST index of 195.3+/-5.5 mg glucose/kg body weight decreased progressively with maternal consumption of 5 to 20% vol/vol ethanol to 122.5+/-13.9 mg glucose/kg body weight in the 20% ethanol group. HISS-independent insulin action and the glucose disposal effect of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 were unaltered. FEE lead to insulin resistance completely attributable to ethanol dose-related suppression of HISS action (HDIR) in the adult male offspring. The possibility of the same relationship in humans requires evaluation.

N2  - Frequent alcohol drinking during pregnancy may result in facial dysmorphism, growth retardation and central nervous system deficits in infants ranging from Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). However, few studies has been done to empirical research the psychosomatic approach among women with FAE. In this study, twelve women with FAE infants were selected and interviewed at two or three days after delivery with CMI, MAS, and ANS-S, in order to elucidate the number of problems with mental health of them. All of women with FAE infants drank alcohol during the pregnancy consumed 2 or 3 drinks per week (ethanol consumption less than 92.0 gms per week). The mean mother's age of FAE infants is 30.2 years (range 27-35) and that of healthy mother is 30.3 years (range 24-35). Eleven of 12 (91.7%) infants were identified having the smooth philtrum, 9 (75.0%) with thin upper lip, 3 (25%) with hypersensitivity, 3 (25%) with sleeping disturbance, 2 (16.7%) with growth retardation. Eighty-three percent of infant with FAE had an adequate body weight and height. In comparison with the women without FAE, women with FAE infants were noted to have a significant difference of the score of CMI (p < 0.0001), MAS (p < 0.0001), ANS-S (p < 0.02). Psychosomatic interview revealed that women with FAE infants have increased anxiety neurosis and stress state. Seventy-five percent of women with FAE infants had an anxiety compared with control group (18.8%). Our findings in this study are important because 12 women with FAE infants were not alcoholics and did not consider themselves to have alcohol problems. Therefore, obstetrician has to cut down women alcohol intake considerably during pregnancy for preventing adverse fetal effects. Alcohol consumption and psychometric works also need to be done for detecting at risk use of alcohol during the pregnancy.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to serious birth defects and developmental disabilities. A need exists to develop effective strategies for both children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or other prenatal alcohol-related effects and for women at high risk for having an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Since the syndrome was identified approximately 30 years ago, advancements have been made in FAS diagnostics, surveillance, prevention, and intervention, but a substantial amount of work remains. Collaborations among partners in federal state, and local agencies, academia, clinical professions, school systems, and families are critical to developing and implementing successful efforts related to FAS and fetal alcohol effect (FAE). In 1999, Congress directed the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to convene the National Task Force on FAS and FAE (the Task Force). CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Team, coordinates the Task Force and manages its operation. Since the Task Force was chartered in 2000, Task Force members, with input from multiple partners, have convened to deliberate and determine the Task Force mission, goals, and priority concerns to be addressed. This report describes the structure, function, mission, and goals of the Task Force and provides their first recommendations. An explanation of how the Task Force recommendations were generated and the Task Forces next steps are also reported.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol often induces birth defects that combine morphological stigmata with neurological or neuropsychological deficits. But it has proved problematic to diagnose these syndromes in adolescents and adults, in whom the morphological signs are absent or attenuated, the behavioral deficits nonspecific, and the exposure history often difficult to reconstruct. Localizing the associated brain abnormalities might circumvent most of these difficulties. To this end, three-dimensional (3D) locations were recorded for 67 homologous points on or near the corpus callosum in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images from 60 adolescents and adults who were normal, 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, and 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol effects. We combined the standard statistical approach to this type of geometric data, Procrustes analysis, with a multivariate strategy focusing on differences in variability. In this data set, the shape of the corpus callosum and its vicinity proves systematically much more variable in the alcohol-affected brains than in those of the normal subjects. From this excess variability follows a promising classification rule, having both high sensitivity (100 out of 117) and high specificity (49 out of 60) in this sample. The discrimination uses four landmark points and two summary scores of callosal outline shape. The information from the corpus callosum and vicinity, as viewed in MR brain images of full-grown subjects, may serve as a permanent record of the prenatal effects of alcohol, even in patients who are first suspected of these syndromes relatively late in life or who lack the facial signs of prenatal alcohol damage. The statistical pattern underlying the callosal diagnosis also leads to speculations on mechanisms of the prenatal damage. Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have numerous adverse health consequences for the developing fetus, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related effects, and therefore is a significant public health problem. A variety of programs have been developed to prevent drinking during pregnancy and the resulting health problems. Some of these efforts, such as public service announcements and beverage warning labels, are universal and strive to increase the public's knowledge about FAS. Selective prevention approaches target women of reproductive age who drink alcohol. Such approaches may involve screening all pregnant women for alcohol consumption and counseling those women who do drink. Indicated prevention approaches target high-risk women (e.g., women who have previously abused alcohol or have had a child with FAS or other alcohol-related effects) and typically offer repeated counseling over several years. Both selective and indicated prevention efforts can reduce maternal alcohol consumption and improve the outcome of the offspring.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome--Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, and New York, 1995-1997
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy and is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. FAS is diagnosed on the basis of a combination of growth deficiency (pre- or postnatal), central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, facial dysmorphology, and maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Estimates of the prevalence of FAS vary from 0.2 to 1.0 per 1,000 live-born infants. This variation is due, in part, to the small size of the populations studied, varying case definitions, and different surveillance methods. In addition, differences have been noted among racial/ethnic populations. To monitor the occurrence of FAS, CDC collaborated with five states (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, New York, and Wisconsin*) to develop the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network (FASSNet). This report summarizes the results of an analysis of FASSNet data on children born during 1995-1997, which indicate that FAS rates in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, and New York ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 per 1,000 live-born infants and were highest for black and American Indian/Alaska Native populations. This study demonstrates that FASSNet is a useful tool that enables health care professionals to monitor the occurrence of FAS and to evaluate the impact of prevention, education, and intervention efforts.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a collection of signs and symptoms seen in children of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. With the increasing incidence of FAS, there is a great variation of its clinical features different from that described in the standard textbooks. This article aims to report on the unusual clinical features of FAS. It also aims to explain the mechanism of action of alcohol as a teratogenic agent.

T1  - The Toronto experience in diagnosing alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder: A unique profile of deficits and assets

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which involves the triad of features reflecting facial dysmorphology, growth retardation and intellectual impairments, encompasses a relatively small proportion of the children affected prenatally by alcohol. Unfortunately, in the absence of facial dysmorphology, the diagnosis is difficult in the majority of children, who are considered to have alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Because accepted clinical methods are not pathognomonic, a novel profile approach was used to examine neuropsychological abilities and disabilities to identify children with ARND who do not meet the diagnostic criteria of FAS. OBJECTIVE: To establish a set of criteria, to be validated in future studies, for characterizing the neuropsychological profile of children with ARND. By describing the procedures at this preliminary stage of our work, the goal is to draw attention to this neglected topic and to suggest a model that can be replicated and validated by others, and to provide the first systematic clinical report on diagnosing ARND in Canada. PROCEDURES: On the basis of the literature, parents' descriptions and the authors' own experience with ARND, a profile of neuropsychological characteristics, including both deficits and assets, that are associated with prenatal alcohol exposure was hypothesized. A group of children was then evaluated, mostly adoptees or children in foster care, who were referred for learning and behavioural problems potentially associated with gestational exposure. Their results were submitted to a profile analysis by comparing their deficits and assets according to a list describing a hypothetical ARND profile to determine whether each child fit or did not fit the ARND profile. Groups were compared for background characteristics, FAS symptomatology, and results on specific neuropsychological and behavioural tests. Finally, the characteristics most strongly differentiating the two groups were identified. SETTING: Hospital-based outpatient program. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two children aged four to 18 years who were referred for a diagnostic assessment related to suspected or known prenatal alcohol exposure. OUTCOME MEASURES: Each child's assessment results were compared against a list of 21 deficits and six assets by two independent raters. Children with an average of more than 60% deficits and 50% assets were considered to have ARND, while the remainder were not. RESULTS: Twenty-eight children (54%) were assigned to the ARND group and 24 to the non-ARND group. The groups did not differ in physical features or home background characteristics, with the exception of higher parental intelligence quotient in the non-ARND group. The ARND group was more likely to have repeated a grade or received special education and scored lower on standardized measures of intelligence, language and memory abilities. Frequency of behaviour or social problems were equivalent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A profile approach used to identify children with ARND discriminates problems in neuropsychological but not behavioural domains. Because elevated scores on behavioural tasks in both ARND and non-ARND groups were clinically significant, more research is needed to identify what behavioural problems are unique to children with ARND compared with other clinic-referred children.

T1  - Interhemispheric transfer in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Roebuck T.M.
A1  - Mattson S.N.
A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure has long been associated with alterations in brain structure and behavioral changes. The corpus callosum can be affected by heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, and agenesis (absence) of this structure occurs more often in children with fetal alcohol syndrome than in the general population or in other developmentally delayed populations. Although the majority of children with fetal alcohol syndrome do not have agenesis of the corpus callosum, callosal area is reduced in this population, particularly in the anterior and posterior regions. However, the functional implication of these size reductions has not been examined. Methods: The current study used a finger localization task to measure the transfer of information across the corpus callosum in children and adolescents with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and age- and sex-matched controls. In a subset of children, correlational analysis was also conducted between behavioral data and cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum. Results: When compared with nonexposed controls, alcohol-exposed children made more errors on trials for which information had to cross the corpus callosum ("crossed" trials) than on trials for which it did not ("uncrossed" trials), and they also made more errors as the task increased in complexity. Additionally, correlations with magnetic resonance imaging data in a subset of children revealed that impairment in interhemispheric transfer was related to reductions in the size of the corpus callosum. These correlations were independent of effects expected from the relationship between corpus callosum size and general intellectual functioning alone. Conclusions: These findings suggest that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure display subtle deficits in the interhemispheric transfer of information in the somatosensory domain. Such deficits in interhemispheric transfer are likely to be related to the myriad of other behavioral and cognitive impairments observed in these children.

N2  - Alcohol is a known teratogenic substance that operates under a dose-response mechanism. Before we conducted a larger study that examines the use of alcohol both before pregnancy and during pregnancy, it was important to pilot our method for measuring a pregnant mother's alcohol use that would allow us to capture the number of drinks consumed per day while addressing recall bias. The purpose of this study was 1) to pilot the Time Line Followback (TLFB) method developed by Sobell and Sobell (1992, Measuring Alcohol Use. Totowa, NJ: Humana Press) as a method for examining alcohol use during pregnancy and 2) to determine if the use of a study protocol that included biological markers of alcohol use would affect our ability to recruit subjects. Using a descriptive design, we tested our protocol for collecting alcohol use data with 10 mothers receiving prenatal care. We measured alcohol use using the TLFB method (Sobell and Sobell, 1992, Measuring Alcohol Use. Totowa, NJ: Humana Press, 1996). We also collected collected biological blood markers for heavy alcohol use. Of the 10 maternal subjects we recruited, 5 mothers (50%) reported alcohol use during pregnancy. We successfully recruited 10 out of 11 mothers approached and had a 100% retention rate for the second interview. The TLFB method is viable for measuring fetal alcohol exposure over the pregnancy, and the collection of blood samples did not impact our ability to recruit or retain mothers.

N2  - We determined the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in a foster care population and evaluated the performance of the FAS Facial Photographic Screening Tool. All children enrolled in a Washington State Foster Care Passport Program were screened for three conditions: (1) the FAS facial phenotype from a photograph, (2) evidence of brain damage with prenatal alcohol exposure from their Health and Education passport, and/or (3) other syndromes identifiable from a facial photograph. Screen-positives received diagnostic evaluations at a FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network clinic. The prevalence of FAS in this foster care population was 10 to 15/1000, or 10 to 15 times greater than in the general population. The screening tool performed with 100% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity, 85.7% predictive value positive, and 100% predictive value negative. We conclude that the foster care population is a high-risk population for FAS. The screening tool performed with very high accuracy and could be used to track FAS prevalence over time in foster care to accurately assess the effectiveness of primary prevention efforts.

N2  - Background: Growth deficits are among the cardinal features for the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. Growth deficits have also been noted among those who were exposed to alcohol prenatally but who do not have fetal alcohol syndrome. Few studies have observed subjects past early and middle childhood, however, to evaluate the longer-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on growth in adolescence. This is a report of the effects of alcohol exposure during gestation on the size of the offspring at 14 years of age. Methods: Women were recruited in their fourth prenatal month. These women were interviewed in the fourth and seventh months of pregnancy and at delivery. The women and their children were seen when the offspring were 14 years of age. Results: Growth deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were identified among the offspring at 14 years of age. Weight, height, head circumference, and skinfold thickness continued to be significantly affected by prenatal alcohol exposure after controlling for other significant predictors of size. These effects exhibited a dose-response pattern, and significant effects were found at levels below one drink per day. For example, first trimester alcohol exposure predicted weights of 152 lbs for the offspring of abstainers, 149 lbs for the offspring of light drinkers (>0 and <0.2 drinks per day), 143 lbs for the offspring of moderate drinkers (>0.2 and <0.89 drinks per day), and 136 lbs for the offspring of heavy drinkers (>0.89 drinks per day). Conclusions: Prenatal alcohol exposure continues to affect size at age 14 years in this cohort of children followed since their fourth month of gestation.

N2  - Serotonin (5-HT) has specific roles not only as a transmitter but also as a signal for differentiation. We recently found that alcohol drinking during pregnancy resulted in incomplete neural tube fusion which hindered the development of midline cells such as 5-HT neurons in mice. We now report that, at the birth of 5-HT neurons (E11), the 5-HT immunoreactive (5-HT-im) neurons are often found missing medial projecting fibers towards ventricle in the Alcohol treated group (ALC) as compared with pair-fed (PF) and Chow-fed groups (Chow) in mice. At E13, there are fewer 5-HT-im neurons in either dorsal or median raphe of ALC as compared with PF or Chow; furthermore, neurite outgrowth and migration of the 5-HT neurons are also compromised with alcohol exposure. We, thus, demonstrated that fetal alcohol exposure compromised 5-HT development as early as at the 5-HT neuron birth. Since 5-HT is a signal for development of many forebrain neurons, the deviation of 5-HT in early life may have consequences on brain development that extend beyond those seen in the 5-HT system.

T1  - Ethanol induces morphological and dynamic changes on in vivo and in vitro neural crest cells
A1  - Rovasio R.A.
A1  - Battiato N.L.
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is an embryopathology related to maternal alcohol drinking. The information concerning the factors involved in the prenatal mechanisms of ethanol action at the cellular and molecular levels is scarce. Because several abnormal changes in FAS involve regions colonized by cell lineages derived from neural crest cells (NCCs), it is reasonable to propose that epigenetic alteration of this cell population can represent an important component of the etiopathogeny. The aim of this work was to evaluate the direct effect of ethanol on a chick embryo model, as well as on in vitro NCC morphology and dynamic behavior. Methods: After ethanol treatment, in ovo or cultured chick embryos were used to determine the anatomical development of and to quantify the migratory parameters and apoptosis of NCCs. Scanning electron microscopy was performed on ethanol-perfused (and control) cultures of cephalic and trunk NCCs; the actin cytoskeleton was evaluated, and morphometric and dynamic parameters were determined after time-lapse videorecording. Recovery capacity after ethanol treatment was also determined. Results: Chick embryos submitted to conditions sufficient to induce FAS in mammals displayed developmental disruptions frequently accompanied by cephalic/facial anomalies. In vitro studies also indicated that cephalic and trunk NCCs exposed to ethanol exhibited significant and permanent changes regarding cell shape, surface morphology, apoptotic cell death, cytoskeleton, and distance and velocity traveled, as well as an abnormal pattern of migration. Conclusions: Taking into account that even a limited period of abnormal behavior may imply serious consequences in the final cues of an embryonic cell population, our results indicate that the biological effects of ethanol on early development - even during a short time - could induce permanent ontogenetic perturbations of NCCs, with potentially dramatic effects on embryonic morphogenesis. These results support an important participation of NCCs in the etiopathogeny of FAS.

There is great variability of behavioral deficits within these groups. We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with neurocognitive and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over the variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline curves of the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions from T1-weighted MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15 with FAE, and 15 who were unexposed and clinically normal. From 5 h of neuropsychological testing we extracted 260 scores and ratings pertaining to attention, memory, executive function, fine and gross motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline shape was analyzed by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to behavior by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly more variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With the excess shape variation are associated two different profiles of behavioral deficit unrelated to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE distinction within the exposed subgroup. A relatively thick callosum is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive function; one that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed from the unexposed in this sample. Thus there is considerable information in callosal form for prognosis of neuropsychological deficits in this frequently encountered birth defect. © 2002 Elsevier Science.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol often induces birth defects that combine morphological stigmata with neurological or neuropsychological deficits. But it has proved problematic to diagnose these syndromes in adolescents and adults, in whom the morphological signs are absent or attenuated, the behavioral deficits nonspecific, and the exposure history often difficult to reconstruct. Localizing the associated brain abnormalities might circumvent most of these difficulties. To this end, three-dimensional (3D) locations were recorded for 67 homologous points on or near the corpus callosum in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images from 60 adolescents and adults who were normal, 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, and 60 diagnosed with fetal alcohol effects. We combined the standard statistical approach to this type of geometric data, Procrustes analysis, with a multivariate strategy focusing on differences in variability. In this data set, the shape of the corpus callosum and its vicinity proves systematically much more variable in the alcohol-affected brains than in those of the normal subjects. From this excess variability follows a promising classification rule, having both high sensitivity (100 out of 117) and high specificity (49 out of 60) in this sample. The discrimination uses four landmark points and two summary scores of callosal outline shape. The information from the corpus callosum and vicinity, as viewed in MR brain images of full-grown subjects, may serve as a permanent record of the prenatal effects of alcohol, even in patients who are first suspected of these syndromes relatively late in life or who lack the facial signs of prenatal alcohol damage. The statistical pattern underlying the callosal diagnosis also leads to speculations on mechanisms of the prenatal damage. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Memory deficits are reported commonly in children with fetal alcohol syndrome. However, little, is known about nonverbal memory performance in this population. Methods: The current study examined learning and memory abilities in alcohol-exposed children and nonexposed controls. Multiple verbal and nonverbal measures were used that incorporated repeated learning trials and delayed recall trials. The alcohol-exposed group included children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with and without fetal alcohol syndrome. Children ranged in age from 8 to 16 years, and groups were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure displayed deficits in learning and recall of verbal and nonverbal information across all measures. On learning trials, they recalled fewer words and displayed a lower rate of acquisition. However, when we analyzed delayed verbal recall data after controlling for initial verbal learning, group differences were not apparent. The same pattern did not occur for nonverbal information; children with prenatal alcohol exposure recalled less on delayed recall even when we accounted for initial learning. Conclusions: These data are consistent with previous studies that indicate immediate memory deficits but suggest that, at least for verbal information, delayed recall deficits in this population are better accounted for by deficits in initial learning. Importantly, a different pattern of results was demonstrated for verbal versus nonverbal information, which suggests the need for additional research in this area.

N2  - Alcohol is a physical and behavioural teratogen. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common yet under-recognized condition resulting from maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. While preventable, FAS is also disabling. Although FAS is found in all socioeconomic groups in Canada, it has been observed at high prevalence in select First Nations and Inuit communities in Canada. This statement addresses FAS prevention, diagnosis, early identification and management for health care professionals. Prevention of FAS must occur at two levels. Primary prevention involves eliminating FAS through classroom or community education, and encouraging women to avoid consuming alcohol before conception and throughout pregnancy. Secondary prevention involves identifying women who are drinking while pregnant and reducing their consumption. This statement describes a variety of screening strategies including Tolerance-Annoyance, Cut Down, Eye Opener (T-ACE). Medical practitioners should recommend abstinence starting with the first prenatal visit. Prompt referral for alcohol treatment is recommended for pregnant individuals who are unable to stop drinking alcohol. This statement describes the diagnosis of FAS, partial or atypical FAS, alcohol-related birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. With a history of in-utero alcohol exposure, a diagnosis of FAS should be considered with current or previous growth deficiency, select facial abnormalities involving the upper lip and eyes, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. These features are best quantified with the use of a four-digit diagnostic method. Strategies for early identification of possible alcohol-related abnormalities are outlined. Intervention focuses on optimizing development, managing behavioural difficulties and providing appropriate school programming. Of prime importance is earliest possible childhood intervention to prevent secondary disabilities that may result from delay while awaiting a definitive diagnosis of FAS.

N2  - Objective: Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) births were examined as part of a larger epidemiologic study of FAS in a community in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Method: Using retrospective case-control methodology, 31 mothers who had given birth to FAS children 6 to 9 years previously were compared with 31 matched controls on a variety of demographic, socioeconomic, drinking, family and maternity variables. Descriptive analyses were utilized to determine major differential characteristics between the two groups. Results: In this community with a very high rate of FAS and rather uniform low socioeconomic status, the two groups were found to be comparable with respect to age, annual income, ethnic background, age of initiation of regular drinking, age at birth of the index child, gravidity and parity. However, mothers of FAS children reported initiating drinking at an earlier age, as well as reporting higher rates of heavy alcohol consumption in their extended family, current use of alcohol, drinking before and during pregnancy, and smoking of tobacco (percentage who smoke) during each trimester of the pregnancy. Mothers of FAS children had lower educational attainment and reported lower religiosity than control mothers. Conclusions: This study in South Africa draws upon the experience of mothers of 31 children with FAS to confirm many of the same high-risk variables identified in maternal risk studies in the United States and Europe. Some factors associated with less maternal alcohol abuse in this high-risk population were also identified, which may be helpful for implementing prevention in this region as well as in other developing countries.

N2  - This study examined 17 children (nine males, eight females; mean age 13 years) with prenatal alcohol exposure of various durations. The aim of the study was to detect specific brain morphological alterations by means of MRI and to see if findings correlated with particular cognitive deficits. Of the 17 children, five had been exposed to heavy maternal consumption of alcohol (over 10 drinks/week) during the first trimester only; four had been exposed during the first and second trimester; and eight had been exposed throughout pregnancy. Five children had alcohol related neurobehavioural disorder, seven were diagnosed as having foetal alcohol effects and five were diagnosed as having foetal alcohol syndrome. Hypoplasia of the vermis was observed in 10 children and malformed posterior vermis in one additional child. Five children had hypoplastic cerebellar hemispheres. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum was observed in two children. Small hippocampi were observed in three children and wide cortical sulci in six. No specific structural anomaly correlated with a particular neuropsychological deficit. In this study, deviations in the development of the vermis was the most sensitive morphological indicator of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It was seen in every diagnostic group including children who had been exposed during only the first trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - The question of whether psychosocial stress during pregnancy (alone or in combination with fetal alcohol exposure) has negative consequences for offspring has not been clearly established in human studies. In this article, we present an overview of three prospective longitudinal studies. Using rhesus monkeys as subjects, a noise or hormone stressor, alone or in combination with moderate level alcohol solution, was presented daily during different stages of pregnancy. Prenatal stress resulted in lighter birth weights in two of three studies, and males from the alcohol plus noise stress condition had reduced birth weights. There were no significant effects of any of the prenatal treatments on gestation duration. Both prenatal stress and moderate fetal alcohol exposure reduced attention span and neuromotor capabilities of offspring during the first month of life, while early gestation prenatal stress, during the period of neuronal migration, emerged as a period of enhanced vulnerability for these effects. Under conditions of challenge, prenatally stressed monkeys showed more disturbance behaviors and reduced locomotion and exploration as well as altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to stress. Fetal alcohol exposed monkeys also showed increased HPA axis activity in response to stressful conditions. Finally, altered patterns of alcohol consumption during adolescence were associated with prenatal stress. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Exposure during pregnancy to alcohol (ethanol) produces a number of adverse effects. One of them is fetal alcohol syndrome. The hallmark of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is craniofacial dysmorphism and the changes in craniofacial measurement are dependent on the alcoholic dose and its time of exposure. Since prenatal ethanol exposure can alter craniofacial development in rodents and reliably produce long-term behavioral effect in them, the present study was designed to extend the same changes in the Sprague Dawley species. METHODS: The albino rat was studied to determine whether gestational exposure to alcohol (Ethanol) produces permanent craniofacial effect. On gestational day (GD7-10) 25% ethanol was injected intraperitoneally to pregnant rats. Various dimensions for skull and face of adult male rats were taken. RESULTS: Both vertical and coronal dimensions were altered in the exposed animals. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that exposure to ethanol on a critical gestational period produces permanent craniofacial defects.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Since the late 1970s, many studies have reported on the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (ARND). The three main types of research methods used in these studies are passive surveillance, clinic-based studies, and active case ascertainment. This article describes each of these methods, including their strengths and weaknesses, and summarizes the estimated prevalence of FAS produced by each of these approaches. The maternal risk factors associated with FAS and other alcohol-related anomalies include advanced maternal age, low socioeconomic status, frequent binge drinking, family and friends with drinking problems, and poor social and psychological indicators. Overall, the available literature points to a prevalence rate of FAS of 0.5 to 2 cases per 1,000 births in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s.

N2  - In 1994 Alcohol Health & Research World (now titled Alcohol Research & Health) last devoted a full issue to the topic of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). This introductory article provides readers with information on how the field has advanced since then. In addition to tracing the development of the terminology used in the field, it describes the difficulties involved in determining the true prevalence of FAS and ARBD; the mechanisms that may play a role in alcohol-derived fetal injuries; approaches to preventing drinking during pregnancy; and strategies for assisting people who have been born with FAS and ARBD.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is often associated with cardiac hypertrophy and impaired ventricular function in a manner similar to postnatal chronic alcohol ingestion. Chronic alcoholism has been shown to lead to hypomagnesemia, and dietary Mg2+ supplementation was shown to ameliorate ethanol-induced cardiovascular dysfunction such as hypertension. However, the role of gestational Mg2+ supplementation on FAS-related cardiac dysfunction is unknown. This study was conducted to examine the influence of gestational dietary Mg2+ supplementation on prenatal ethanol exposure-induced cardiac contractile response at the ventricular myocyte level. Timed-pregnancy female rats were fed from gestation day 2 with liquid diets containing 0.13 g/L Mg2+ supplemented with ethanol (36%) or additional Mg2+ (0.52 g/L), or both. The pups were maintained on standard rat chow through adulthood, and ventricular myocytes were isolated and stimulated to contract at 0.5 Hz. Mechanical properties were evaluated using an IonOptix soft-edge system, and intracellular Ca2+ transients were measured as changes in fura-2 fluorescence intensity (DELTAFFI). Offspring from all groups displayed similar growth curves. Myocytes from the ethanol group exhibited reduced cell length, enhanced peak shortening (PS), and shortened time to 90% relengthening (TR90) associated with a normal DELTAFFI and time to PS (TPS). Mg2+ reverted the prenatal ethanol-induced alteration in PS and maximal velocity of relengthening. However, it shortened TPS and TR90, and altered the DELTAFFI, as well as Ca2+ decay rate by itself. Additionally, myocytes from the ethanol group exhibited impaired responsiveness to increased extracellular Ca 2+ or stimulating frequency, which were restored by gestational Mg2+ supplementation. These data suggest that although gestational Mg2+ supplementation may be beneficial to certain cardiac contractile dysfunctions in offspring of alcoholic mothers, caution must be taken, as Mg2+ supplementation affects cell mechanics itself.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Although high-dose prenatal alcohol exposure is related to cognitive and behavioral impairments in children and adolescents with fetal alcohol syndrome, there is relatively little research on the effects of moderate drinking during pregnancy. We examined learning, memory, and behavior in adolescent rhesus monkeys prenatally exposed to moderate levels of alcohol, psychological stress, or both alcohol and stress. Methods: Forty adolescent rhesus monkey subjects were derived from four groups of female rhesus monkeys that (1) consumed alcohol throughout gestation; (2) experienced prenatal stress; (3) experienced prenatal stress and alcohol consumption; or (4) control group (no alcohol, no stress). The subjects were assessed for number of trials required to reach 90% criterion of correct responses on nonmatching-tosample task (NMS), followed by trials with delays of 30, 60, or 120 sec. Ratings of behavior during testing were made after each session. Results: Subjects exposed to moderate prenatal alcohol required significantly more trials to reach criterion on the acquisition phase of the NMS task but had no difficulty with delays. Prenatally stressed monkeys showed lower response inhibition or less behavioral restraint, whereas prenatal alcohol plus stress monkeys showed higher activity level and stereotypies compared with controls. High scores on neonatal measures of orientation (attending to novel stimuli) and motor maturity and low scores on irritability, activity, stereotypies, and impulsivity during acquisition were correlated with fewer trials to criterion on acquisition of NMS. Conclusions: NMS trials required to reach criterion and behavior during testing are sensitive to moderate-level prenatal alcohol exposure in monkeys. The most adverse behavioral outcomes (hyperactivity and stereotypies) were associated with prenatal alcohol plus stress, raising concerns that environmental stress might provide the context within which fetal alcohol exposure could promote adverse behavioral outcomes. These effects occurred in the absence of either facial deformities or retarded physical growth.

N2  - PURPOSE: Heavy maternal drinking during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome, but whether more moderate alcohol consumption is associated with such adverse pregnancy outcomes as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) remains controversial. METHODS: Using data from a case-control study, we examined the association between maternal alcohol consumption and risk for IUGR among 701 case and 336 control infants born during 1993-1995 in Monroe County, New York. RESULTS: Our results provide no evidence of an independent association between moderate maternal alcohol consumption (<14 drinks per week) and risk for IUGR. The risk for IUGR among heavy drinkers (>14 drinks per week) around the time of conception was OR = 1.4 (95% CI 0.7-2.6) for IUGR < 5th percentile and OR = 1.4 (95% CI 0.7-2.8) for IUGR 5th-10th percentile. For heavy drinkers during the first trimester, the OR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.4-4.5) for IUGR < 5th percentile and OR = 1.3 (95% CI 0.4-4.8) for IUGR 5th-10th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: Since IUGR is a heterogeneous outcome with a possible multifactorial origin, further studies are needed to examine the combined effects of alcohol and other environmental and genetic factors on IUGR risk for subgroups of IUGR. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose was to demonstrate that an objective, multivariate case definition of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) can be derived by means of craniofacial anthropometry. Study design: Craniofacial measurements (n = 21) were taken of 100 individuals who had been exposed to alcohol before birth (41 FAS, 59 PFAS) and 31 members of a control group. Multivariate discriminant analysis was used to identify craniofacial measurements that best differentiated the 3 groups (FAS, PFAS, and control). Results: Both the FAS and PFAS groups had a unique craniofacial phenotype that could be accurately discriminated from that of the control group. Stepwise discriminant analysis identified 6 craniofacial measurements that could differentiate individuals with and without prenatal alcohol exposure with 96% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 90% specificity. Conclusions: individuals with FAS and PFAS have a distinctive facial phenotype that can be characterized anthropometrically. The phenotypic case definition could be used as a screening tool to identify individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol who do not exhibit a "classic" FAS phenotype but exhibit a more subtle craniofacial dysmorphia.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - It is not known why some heavy-drinking women give birth to children with alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) whereas others do not. The objective of this study was to determine whether the frequency of elevated maternal blood acetaldehyde levels among alcoholics is in the range of ARBD among alcoholic women. MEDLINE was searched from 1980 to 2000 using the key words acetaldehyde, pharmacokinetics, and alcoholism for controlled trials reporting blood or breath acetaldehyde levels in alcoholics and nonalcoholics. Separately, using the key words fetal alcohol syndrome, epidemiology, prevalence, incidence, and frequency, articles were identified reporting ARBD incidences among the offspring of heavy drinkers. Of 23 articles reporting acetaldehyde levels in alcoholics, four met the inclusion criteria. Forty-three studies reported on the rate of ARBD in heavy drinkers, and 14 were accepted. Thirty-four percent of heavy drinkers had a child with ARBD, and 43% of chronic alcoholics had high acetaldehyde levels. The similar frequencies of high acetaldehyde levels among alcoholics and the rates of ARBD among alcoholic women provide epidemiologic support to the hypothesis that acetaldehyde may play a major role in the cause of ARBD.

N2  - Background: Abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC) have been documented in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), ranging from subtle decrements in its size to partial and even complete agenesis. Prenatal exposure to alcohol is also known to result in neurocognitive deficits. Objective: To 1) investigate abnormalities in size, shape, and location of the CC within the brain in individuals with FAS and in those exposed to high amounts of alcohol prenatally but without FAS (PEA group); and 2) determine if there is a relationship between callosal dysmorphology and cognitive test performance. Methods: MRI and novel surface-based image analytic methods were used. Twenty alcohol-exposed subjects (8 to 22 years) along with 21 normal controls (8 to 25 years) were studied with high-resolution MRI and measures of verbal learning and visuospatial abilities. Results: In addition to callosal area reductions, most severe in the splenium, the CC is significantly displaced in patients exposed to alcohol prenatally. In the alcohol-exposed group, this structure lies more anterior and inferior in posterior regions with relatively normal localization of anterior regions. These findings are significant in the FAS group, and a similar but less severe pattern is observed in the PEA patients. The authors show that the amount of CC displacement is correlated with impairment in verbal learning ability and that CC displacement is a better predictor of verbal learning than regional CC area. The brain-behavior relationship is only significant within the alcohol-exposed group, and the effect is not solely mediated by overall impaired verbal intellectual functioning. Conclusions: These results further emphasize the vulnerability of midline brain structures to prenatal alcohol exposure.

A1  - West J.R.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts motor performance in affected offspring. The ventrolateral nucleus (VLN) of the thalamus functions to relay information between the cerebellum and motor cortex. Reductions in the size of the thalamus have been found in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, and therefore a rat model system was used to determine whether VLN size and neuronal number were altered by alcohol exposure during development. Methods: Rat pups were exposed to alcohol in utero during the first 10 days of gestation (first trimester equivalent), the second 10 days of gestation (second trimester equivalent), or the first two trimesters equivalent combined. Some pups were exposed to alcohol in utero during the time of VLN neurogenesis. In addition, offspring from some of the dams treated during the first two trimesters equivalent were reared artificially from postnatal day (P) 4 through P9 (part of the third trimester equivalent) and received binge-like alcohol during this time, resulting in offspring exposed to alcohol during all three trimesters equivalent. Other offspring from untreated dams were reared in the same manner but received alcohol only during the third trimester equivalent. Control animals (nutritional and untreated) were reared for all treatment conditions. All pups were perfused on P10. Results: A unique effect of alcohol treatment was not found for the VLN volume or the number of neural cells within the VLN. However, the period of VLN neurogenesis was found to be sensitive to both alcohol and nutritional control treatments, resulting in significant decreases in the VLN volume and neural cell number. Conclusions: Motor deficits seen in offspring exposed prenatally to alcohol do not seem to result from direct effects on the structure of the VLN of the thalamus.

N2  - Two peptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (ADNF-9)], that are associated with novel glial proteins regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, are shown now to provide protective intervention in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal demise and growth restrictions were produced after intraperitoneal injection of ethanol to pregnant mice during midgestation (E8). Death and growth abnormalities elicited by alcohol treatment during development are believed to be associated, in part, with severe oxidative damage. NAP and ADNF-9 have been shown to exhibit antioxidative and antiapoptotic actions in vitro. Pretreatment with an equimolar combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities. Pretreatment with NAP alone resulted in a significant decrease in alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas ADNF-9 alone had no detectable effect on fetal survival after alcohol exposure, indicating a pharmacological distinction between the peptides. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with 1-h post-alcohol administration. Bioavailability studies with [3H]NAPVSIPQ indicated that 39% of the total radioactivity comigrated with intact peptide in the fetus 60 min after administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.

N2  - Objective: Executive function deficits, including verbal fluency, have been documented in children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure. Whereas nonverbal fluency impairments have been reported in adults with such exposure, these abilities have not been tested in children. Deficits in both verbal and nonverbal fluency were predicted and assessed in children and adolescents with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Method: There was a total of 28 (54% female) sub children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with (n = 10) and without (n = 8) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were compared to nonexposed controls (n = 10) on the design and verbal fluency measures from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System. Both fluency measures consist of three conditions, including a new set-shifting task. All tests require the generation of multiple responses within both rule and time constraints. Results: Data were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance and hierarchical regression analyses. Compared to controls, children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure with and without FAS displayed deficits in both fluency domains, but did not differ from each other. In addition, prenatal alcohol exposure was a significant predictor of performance on the set-shifting design fluency task above and beyond performance on more traditional fluency tasks. IQ was not a significant predictor for the traditional or set-shifting fluency measures, whereas diagnostic group remained a significant predictor when IQ was included in the model. Conclusions: This study adds to the literature on the integrity of executive functions in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, documenting fluency impairment in both verbal and nonverbal domains. It is important to note that these impairments were demonstrated in higher functioning alcohol-exposed children, both with and without FAS, and that diagnostic group explained such deficiencies above and beyond general intellectual ability.

N2  - The association between deficits in emotion-related learning, conceptual set shifting, and behavioral problems was investigated in individuals with substantial prenatal alcohol exposure. Twenty subjects with confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (10 of whom were diagnosed as having Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) and 20 normal controls matched for age, gender, and ethnic background participated. The two groups were administered a battery of tests including two tests of emotion-related learning (visual discrimination reversal and extinction of reward-response associations), tests of conceptual set shifting and intellectual ability, and behavioral measures. The alcohol-exposed group made fewer reversals than the control group in visual discrimination reversal and exhibited more variability in extinction. These group differences remained significant after controlling for intellectual ability and conceptual set shifting. Variability in extinction and two measures of set shifting, perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and omission errors on reversal learning, were found to be robust predictors of parent-rated behavioral problems.

T1  - Pregnancy and drinking: "If it burns going down...": How focus groups can shape fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) prevention
A1  - Branco E.I.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Despite public health campaigns and clinical interventions that encourage women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy, some women continue to drink while pregnant. To provide a more in-depth understanding of how at-risk women regard - and emotionally react to - warnings about drinking alcohol during pregnancy, we conducted focus groups in 1997 with 11 pregnant and recent postpartum Native American and African American women in Los Angeles, California. The main objective of these groups was to uncover relevant aspects of women's beliefs and opinions about drinking during pregnancy that may not have been elicited by other research instruments. Results would then be used to shape a large survey of pregnant at-risk women. Analysis of the transcripts revealed three emergent themes, which had the greatest impact on our subsequent survey. These were women's exposure to and perceived believability of messages, their perception of risk associated with drinking, and the barriers to cutting down on alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Questions added to our survey instrument because of these findings included whether women think that some alcohol beverages are safer to drink than others; how they value cutting back alcohol use; their views on the irreversibility of fetal alcohol syndrome; and what pressures they feel from peers and family to drink during pregnancy. Given the small sample size associated with focus groups, these results cannot be generalized to larger populations however, these women's words revealed important underlying issues and barriers that should be considered in studying and intervening with larger representative samples.

T1  - Measuring the facial phenotype of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure: Correlations with brain dysfunction
A1  - Astley S.J.
A1  - Clarren S.K.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - The purpose of this report is to demonstrate how to measure the magnitude of expression of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) facial phenotype using the new 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and the previously developed D-score and to demonstrate how these two measures of the FAS facial phenotype correlate with brain function and structure; correlations that fail to be identified by the older gestalt method of facial measurement. The D-score and the facial component of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code quantitatively measure the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype using three facial features (palpebral fissure length, philtrum smoothness, and upper lip thinness). These facial measurement systems were developed by the Washington State FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN) of clinics and are used to screen and diagnose the facial component of FAS for all patients evaluated in the network of clinics (1500 to date). The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code is a comprehensive diagnostic system developed by the FAS DPN in 1997 to diagnose the full spectrum of outcomes among patients with prenatal alcohol exposure. The four digits reflect the magnitude of expression of the four key diagnostic features of FAS in the following order: (1) growth deficiency; (2) the FAS facial phenotype; (3) brain dysfunction; (4) gestational alcohol exposure. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code was developed to overcome the subjective, highly variable gestalt method of diagnosis that has been used as the standard to date, worldwide. Prior to the development of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the first 445 patients evaluated in the FAS DPN were diagnosed using the gestalt method. For research purposes, their gestalt diagnoses were transformed into 4-Digit Diagnostic Codes, presenting a unique opportunity to directly compare the two diagnostic methods. When the facial phenotype was measured using the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code or D-score, the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype was significantly correlated with structural, neurologic, and functional measures of brain damage, and the phenotype of those receiving a 4-Digit Diagnosis of FAS showed little variability. When the gestalt method of diagnosis was used, the magnitude of expression of the FAS facial phenotype did not correlate with structural, neurologic and functional measures of brain damage, and the facial phenotype of those receiving a gestalt diagnosis of FAS was highly variable. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and D-score thus provide more precise and accurate measures of the FAS facial phenotype and reveal important correlations with brain structure and function, suggesting that intermediate expressions of the FAS facial phenotype may serve as important risk factors for brain damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Our previous studies revealed abnormalities on structural MRI (sMRI) in small groups of children exposed to alcohol prenatally. Microcephaly, disproportionately reduced basal ganglia volume, and abnormalities of the cerebellar vermis and corpus callosum were demonstrated. The present study used sMRI to examine in detail the regional pattern of brain hypoplasia resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol using a higher resolution imaging protocol and larger sample sizes than reported previously. Fourteen participants (mean 11.4 years; eight females, six males) with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and 12 participants (mean 14.8 years; four females, eight males) with prenatal exposure to alcohol (PEA) but without the facial features of FAS were compared to a group of 41 control participants (mean 12.8 years, 20 females, 21 males). Findings of significant microcephaly and disproportionately reduced basal ganglia volumes in the FAS group were confirmed. Novel findings were that in FAS participants, white matter volumes were more affected than gray matter volumes in the cerebrum, and parietal lobes were more affected than temporal and occipital lobes. Among subcortical structures, in contrast to the disproportionate effects on caudate nucleus, the hippocampus was relatively preserved in FAS participants. Differences between the PEA group and controls were generally non-significant; however, among a few of the structures most affected in FAS participants, there was some evidence for volume reduction in PEA participants as well, specifically in basal ganglia and the parietal lobe. There were no group differences in cerebral volume asymmetries. Severe prenatal alcohol exposure appears to produce a specific pattern of brain hypoplasia.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Women who abuse alcohol during pregnancy may deliver offspring who could be diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or a less severe deficit involving cognitive and behavioral disorders. The severity of the deficits may involve the interaction of several known risk factors, such as alcohol consumption pattern or duration, the timing of alcohol consumption relative to critical windows of vulnerability, or the inherent differential vulnerability among the various brain regions to alcohol-induced brain injury. In this study, we explore the vulnerability of the different brain regions by making cell counts from multiple brain regions. Specifically, we used stereological cell-counting techniques to estimate the total cell numbers in the cerebellum (Purkinje and granule cells), olfactory bulb (mitral and granule cells), hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 cells), and dentate gyrus (granule cells). Groups of timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of five treatments: alcohol by intragastric intubation (2.25, 4.5, or 6.5 g/kg/day), nutritional control [pairfed and intubated=Pairfed) and intubated], and normal control (Chow). Treatments began on embryonic day 1 (E1) and continued through E20. On E33 (usually postnatal day 10), all offspring were perfused intracardially with saline followed by fixatives. Representative forebrains, cerebella, and olfactory bulb from each group were processed for cell counting. The optical dissector was used to obtain cell densities, while Cavalieri's principle was used to calculate the reference volume. The product of density and volume gave unbiased estimates of the total neuronal number within each brain region. Overall peak BACs (regardless of sampling day) for the three alcohol groups averaged 136, 290, and 422 mg/dl for the 2.25-, 4.5-, and 6.5-g/kg groups, respectively. The total number of cerebellar Purkinje cells was reduced in the 6.5-g/kg group relative to controls, while the total number of olfactory bulb mitral cells and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells from all alcohol-treated groups was not different from controls. Total numbers of granule neurons were reduced in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb of offspring exposed to 4.5 or 6.5 g/kg/day, but granule cell numbers in the dentate gyrus were not affected by the prenatal alcohol treatment. Taken together with previous findings, these data demonstrate that prenatal alcohol exposure results in regional vulnerability of various brain structures and underscores the variability of deleterious effects of alcohol on brain development.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Alcohol abuse by pregnant women can result in fetal alcohol effects (FAE) and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Both ethanol itself and its main metabolite, acetaldehyde (Ach), are able to produce specific FAS-related malformations. In previous in vitro studies, we documented that 10-day-old rat embryos exposed to Ach show a characteristic embryonic Ach syndrome, histologically characterized by marked cellular death. As both necrosis and pathological apoptosis are teratological mechanisms, the aim of this work was to evaluate if cellular death, observed in Ach-exposed embryos, can be related to necrotic or apoptotic events. Ten-day-old rat embryos were cultured in the presence of Ach 30-60 mug/ml and stained with the vital dye acridine orange to visualize apoptotic areas. After fixation, the TUNEL [3' terminal deoxynucleotide tranferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling] method was used to histologically identify apoptosis. Both acridine orange and TUNEL staining showed signs of physiological apoptosis in controls and abnormal apoptotic regions in Ach-exposed embryos. Our results show a clear correlation between malformed organs and apoptotic embryonic districts, suggesting the role of apoptosis in Ach-induced abnormalities. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Affective prosody is a nonlinguistic aspect of language that conveys emotion and attitude during discourse. It is a dominant function of the right hemisphere. Because skills associated with the right hemisphere have been found to be impaired in alcoholics, this study explored the possibility that affective prosodic functioning may be sensitive to the effects of alcohol due to heavy persistent drinking or prenatal exposure. Methods: Subjects were aged 25 to 58 years. Twenty-nine men and three women who met DSM-IV criteria for an alcohol use disorder with a median of 39 days of sobriety, 11 men with a probable history of fetal alcohol exposure (FAexp), and 41 age-matched control subjects of both sexes were tested by using the Aprosodia Battery. This instrument assesses affective prosodic comprehension (APC) across a range of verbal articulatory demands. Results: The alcoholic group scored 2 SD below the control mean, and the FAexp group scored -5 SD regardless of whether they had ever been diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Despite their poor performance on APC, alcoholic and FAexp groups performed similarly to the control group on vocabulary, abstract reasoning, and an index of cognitive impairment that used the Shipley Institute of Living Scale. Multiple regression analyses that used nine alcohol use variables to model APC resulted in four significant contributors to the effect. These regressors were related to early exposure to ethanol and chronicity of alcohol abuse. Conclusions: Alcoholics and FAexp subjects were significantly less accurate at APC compared with controls. These alcohol-exposed subjects appear to be deficient in the ability to understand emotional valence in the speech of others, which results in errors of judgment that may impair social interactions.

N2  - Incomplete neural tube fusion (iNTF), induced by alcohol, in midline floor and roof plates was found in our recent study. In this study, serotonin (5-HT) neurons, known to be born entirely in the midline raphe at brainstem, were examined during their development with fetal alcohol exposure. Weight-matched C57BL mice pregnant dams were divided into three groups on E8: one received ethanol via a chocolate Sustacal liquid diet providing 20% ethanol-derived calories as the sole source of nutrients (ALC); the second received an isocaloric Sustacal liquid diet and was pair-fed to individual dams in the ethanol-fed group (PF); the third was fed ad lib rat chow (Chow). Fetal brains were obtained on E15 and were processed for immunostaining of 5-HT and its trophic factor, S100beta. The ascending 5-HT neurons, in normal development, appear bilaterally near midline on E12, and by E15, as seen in chow and PF groups, migrate from the midline germinal zone laterally and dorsally to their final position with rich fibers. In contrast, in the E15 ALC group, many 5-HT-im neurons were found remaining in the midline germinal region or had migrated, but with under-differentiated, sparse fibers. There were 20-30% fewer 5-HT-im neurons in ALC as compared to PF and Chow. In addition, the number of S100beta cells was less in ALC as compared with PF and Chow groups. No difference was found between PF and Chow in number of 5-HT-im or S100beta-im cells. The 5-HT neurons found compromised in migration and differentiation may, in part, stem from failure of access to floor plate or midline tissue induction and the insufficient support by S100beta. As 5-HT neurons have been implicated for signaling brain maturation, fewer 5-HT neurons may have lasting effects on the development of brain or, if persistent in the adult, profoundly affect adult brain function. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

T1  - Identifying maternal self-reported alcohol use associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: The incidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) has been estimated at 1 to 3 per 1000 live births. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) (which include FAS) are estimated to occur in about 1 in 100 births. Cessation of drinking during pregnancy can improve the outcome even if the unborn child is already affected. For individuals born with FASD, an early diagnosis appears to be a protective factor against secondary disabilities. A quick screening tool to identify newborn children at risk has been elusive. Methods: A simple descriptive presentation is offered that shows where 36 individuals with FASD were found from among the many patterns and amounts of prenatal alcohol use that were reported by a sample of 1439 pregnant women whose offspring were later examined within the first 7 years of life. Results: Individuals with FASD (i.e., those with FAS, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder) were found within two aggregates of alcohol scores that together recommend a set of three to four alcohol questions. Within this derivation sample, one scoring of the questions yields almost 78% sensitivity and 97% specificity for FASD. Another scoring of the same instrument yields 100% sensitivity with 90% specificity. Conclusions: These new data may facilitate early identification of offspring who may be most in need of early intervention, namely those born with FASD.

N2  - Background: Epilepsy is a prominent sign of neurologic dysfunction in some children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, it is unknown whether the epileptic disorders in these children are directly due to the neuroteratogenic effects of alcohol or to some other factor accompanying maternal alcoholism. The hippocampus is vulnerable to alcohol-induced pathologic changes, and dysfunction of the hippocampus often manifests as epilepsy. We examined the effect of alcohol exposure during development on the seizure threshold and examined the relationship between alteration of seizure threshold and alcohol-induced neuronal loss from the hippocampus. Methods: Rat pups received 0.85, 2.5, or 3.75 g/kg of alcohol via intragastric intubation daily over postnatal days (PD) 4-9. An intubated control and a suckle control group were also included. To assess the effect of a single day of alcohol exposure, an additional group received 3.75 g/kg of alcohol on PD 4 alone. Behavioral seizure thresholds were determined by intravenous infusion of the proconvulsant, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), on PD 31 or on PD 90. In addition, electrographic seizure thresholds were determined by recording extracellular field potentials from the dentate gyrus. The number of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, CA3 pyramidal cells, and granule cells of the dentate gyrus were determined by stereology. Results: Daily exposure to alcohol resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the seizure threshold and in the selective loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. Reduction in the seizure threshold was significantly correlated with loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. Recordings of extracellular field potentials confirmed the alcohol-induced reduction in seizure threshold, demonstrated that PTZ-induced seizures involve hippocampal-parahippocampal circuitry, and provided evidence that the hippocampal formation is the generator of the PTZ-induced seizures in alcohol-exposed animals. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that exposure of the developing brain to alcohol can permanently reduce the threshold for both behavioral and electrographic seizures and can selectively kill hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Both the pathologic findings and the physiologic recordings support the concept that the reduced seizure threshold in alcohol-exposed animals is due to hippocampal pathology.

N2  - Background: Understanding the basis for ethanol's teratogenic effects may inform the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome. Here we investigate how genetic background and susceptibility to ethanol-induced neural crest apoptosis contribute to the distinctive craniofacial phenotype observed after prenatal alcohol exposure. Methods: Nine different chick strains were exposed to ethanol at gastrulation. The sensitivity of these embryos to ethanol-induced neural crest apoptosis was reported elsewhere (Debelak and Smith, 2000). Here, these embryos were permitted to develop until embryonic day 10, when facial morphogenesis was largely complete, and cephalometric measurements were made on cleared skulls. Shifts in facial growth were correlated against the severity of ethanol-induced apoptosis in facial precursors. Results: The facial shape produced by ethanol exposure was a function of the embryos' genetic strain. Three general responses were observed: apparent midfacial flattening (Babcock B300 x Hampshire Red, ISA-Babcock, HyLine W98, and HyLine W36 strains), overall facial expansion (Spafas and Babcock B300 strains), or overall facial hypoplasia (DeKalb strains). When dose and timing of exposure were held constant, the embryo's genetic background predicted the facial outcome. For ethanol-sensitive strains, apoptosis of facial precursor populations was required to produce the facial defects. That some strains had essentially normal faces despite extensive cell death indicated a capacity to recover from the earlier neural crest losses. Conclusions: We propose that ethanol's effects on craniofacial development are multifactoral, and these influences may include susceptibility to apoptosis, regenerative capacity, and compensatory outgrowth of the facial primordia. The embryo's genetic background may modulate these events. The high and low responder chick strains are useful tools to dissect these contributions.

T1  - Effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on midsagittal commissure size in rats
A1  - Bower C.
A1  - Ryan A.
A1  - Rudy E.
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol exposure in humans can cause a variety of brain and behavioral abnormalities. The brain abnormalities include defects in the corpus callosum that range from total absence (agenesis) to reduction in size or thickness. Determination of the critical alcohol level or time period of exposure to produce these effects is difficult because of the lack of control of possible mitigating factors. Methods: The present study was undertaken to examine possible relationships between midsagittal corpus callosum dimensions and prenatal alcohol level as measured by blood alcohol concentration, as well as prenatal period of exposure as measured by first- or second- or first- plus second-trimester equivalents in a rat model. In addition to the corpus callosum, the hippocampal and anterior commissures were also examined. Pregnant mothers were given a single daily dose of alcohol by intragastric gavage; four different doses were tested in different mothers. Peak blood alcohol concentration was determined at one of four hourly intervals thereafter. Control pregnant mothers were pairfed to individual alcohol treated mothers and handled accordingly, but no alcohol was given. Other controls consisted of normal, untreated pregnant mothers. Results: The results show all measures of corpus callosum and anterior commissure were not affected by any dose of alcohol during any time period. However, higher BAC levels during prolonged periods of alcohol exposure were associated with reduced size of the hippocampal commissure. Conclusions: The results suggest that additional experimental factors not included in the present study are responsible for the effects observed in humans. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a whole spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) sequelae that persist throughout the life span and manifest in a spectrum of effects from clinically indistinguishable to severely impairing. The greatest impact of alcohol as a teratogen is to the brain-the greatest need is for holistic treatment and management of the associated mental disorders. The interaction of this subtle brain damage with the complex psychosocial circumstances surrounding the birth of a child to a mother with alcohol problems can further compound development and result in costly and devastating social consequences. Research is urgently needed on the chronic neuropsychiatric sequelae of these subtle birth defects of the brain. Identification of these fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in the psychiatric nomenclature is a necessary step to focus the attention and resources of the mental health field on this personally and socially significant problem.

T1  - An alternative to standard drinks as a measure of alcohol consumption
A1  - Kaskutas L.A.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Despite the field's longstanding concern with underreporting of alcohol consumption, traditional survey questions encourage error because respondents often must calculate their number of drinks based on standard drink sizes that often do not match their own drinking style. This study considered how often respondents' self-defined drink sizes matched a 'standard' drink size based on approximately 12 g of ethanol for six different beverages. We also studied whether respondents could accurately judge the size of their drinks. Subjects were recruited and interviewed at urban prenatal clinics, health clinics, and via snowball referrals and community outreach in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Because of the urgency of accurate measurement of consumption during pregnancy, urban pregnant women from the groups most at risk for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Native Americans (n = 102) and African Americans (185), were targeted. A small comparison group of urban pregnant white women (n = 34) was included. One-hour in-person interviews were conducted. Self-defined drink sizes were determined for each beverage consumed, using models and photographs of vessels. Frequent drinkers and the majority of women who reported drinking higher alcohol content beverages reported drinking larger-than-standard drink sizes. The median size of a malt liquor drink among the daily drinkers was almost three times as large as the standard, their fortified wine drinks were four times the standard, and their spirits drinks were six times the standard size. The majority of drinkers of each beverage were unable to accurately judge the size of their drinks, underestimating the number of fluid ounces by about 30%. Although the vessels methodology used here must be refined and tested further on other populations (e.g., men, nonpregnant women, and all ethnic groups), results suggest that determination of risk levels should be based on survey data that takes into consideration the beverage mix and the actual size of respondents' alcohol drinks.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most devastating. Recognizable by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities and growth deficiency, this condition includes severe alcohol-induced damage to the developing brain. FAS children experience deficits in intellectual functioning; difficulties in learning, memory, problem-solving, and attention; and difficulties with mental health and social interactions. An FAS diagnosis, however, fails to identify prenatal-alcohol-exposed children who lack the characteristic facial defects and growth deficiency of FAS. Nonetheless, these often undiagnosed children may still experience serious fetal alcohol effects (FAE), including alcohol-induced mental impairments (i.e., alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorder) or alcohol-related abnormalities of the skeleton and certain organ systems (i.e., alcohol-related birth defects). Neuroimaging techniques can assist researchers in identifying FAE through precise pictures of brain abnormalities in persons prenatally exposed to alcohol. By understanding the mechanisms underlying FAE and the behavioral manifestations of the resulting structural brain damage, researchers can ultimately develop effective FAS prevention strategies that identify and assist high-risk women at varying levels of pregnancy.

T1  - Reducing complications from alcohol use during pregnancy through screening
A1  - Morse B.A.
A1  - Hutchins E.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal providers are reluctant to discuss alcohol use in the clinical setting, even though heavy alcohol use is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), sometimes known as alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. Fourteen percent to 20% of pregnant women report drinking some alcohol during pregnancy. Approximately 0.2% to 1% meet the criteria for heavy drinking. Reducing drinking during pregnancy has the potential to reduce the risk for FAS and FAE. Routine screening for alcohol use during pregnancy followed by referrals for those considered to be at risk is recommended. Women are often more receptive to intervention during pregnancy, as they focus on positive health behaviors. A number of brief screening tools designed for use on a routine basis are reviewed. Physicians who learn to comfortably discuss alcohol use during pregnancy can help substantially reduce the impact of these disorders.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, mental retardation, and neurodevelopmental disorders. In 1973, a cluster of birth defects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure was recognized as a clinical entity called fetal alcohol syndrome. More recently, alcohol exposure in utero has been linked to a variety of other neurodevelopmental problems, and the terms alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects have been proposed to identify infants so affected. This statement is an update of a previous statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics and reflects the current thinking about alcohol exposure in utero and the revised nosology.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - PURPOSE: Fetal exposure to alcohol is a serious public health problem and is associated with anomalies of the eye ground, as well as neurodevelopmental delay, growth delay, and characteristic facial features. Our purpose is to report the incidence of abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) results in children with fetal alcohol syndrome and raise awareness of the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome in ophthalmology. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on the records of 11 children with the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. The results of the ophthalmologic examination, magnetic resonance imaging, visual acuity test, and ERG are reported. RESULTS: The magnetic resonance imaging results were abnormal in all subjects tested. The ophthalmology examination showed optic nerve hypoplasia in 91% of the subjects. Visual acuity was reduced in all but one subject. The ERG results were abnormal, showing reduced b-wave amplitude, increased a- and b-wave implicit time, reduced Rmax, and increased log (k). The scotopic ERG was more severely affected than the photopic ERG. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to changes in retinal function as evidenced by an abnormal ERG response. The ERG can therefore be a tool with which to identify suspected alcohol embryopathy.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a specific polydystrophic pattern of malformations with the following diagnostic criteria: 1. Maternal alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse during pregnancy. 2. Pre- and postnatal deficiency of growth in weight, height and head circumference. 3. Multiple minor and major anomalies recognizable mainly at a typical face. 4. Structural injuries and changes at the central nervous system with complex brain dysfunction combining elements of cognitive impairments, behavioral disturbance and neurological damage. Fetal alcohol effects (FAE) or so-called "alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders" (ARND) with predominant neurotoxic effects and a large spectrum of cerebral dysfunctions are manifold more frequent than the full-blown FAS. These remain mostly unrecognized, overlooked and they are difficult to be diagnosed, the symptoms being unspecific. Alcohol in pregnancy is nowadays the most important and the most frequent toxic substance for the embryo and the fetus and one of the most frequent causes of mental retardation. The longlasting and irreversible consequences refer to school development, social maturation, social behaviour and later life-style. The diagnosis is based on the careful maternal history and on the clinical findings; there are no biochemical parameters of assessment. The risk of addiction development in these children is assumed to be more than 20 percent.

T1  - An alternative to standard drinks as a measure of alcohol consumption

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Despite the field's longstanding concern with underreporting of alcohol consumption, traditional survey questions encourage error because respondents often must calculate their number of drinks based on standard drink sizes that often do not match their own drinking style. This study considered how often respondents' self-defined drink sizes matched a 'standard' drink size based on approximately 12 g of ethanol for six different beverages. We also studied whether respondents could accurately judge the size of their drinks. Subjects were recruited and interviewed at urban prenatal clinics, health clinics, and via snowball referrals and community outreach in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Because of the urgency of accurate measurement of consumption during pregnancy, urban pregnant women from the groups most at risk for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Native Americans (n=102) and African Americans (185), were targeted. A small comparison group of urban pregnant white women (n=34) was included. One-hour in-person interviews were conducted. Self-defined drink sizes were determined for each beverage consumed, using models and photographs of vessels. Frequent drinkers and the majority of women who reported drinking higher alcohol content beverages reported drinking larger-than-standard drink sizes. The median size of a malt liquor drink among the daily drinkers was almost three times as large as the standard, their fortified wine drinks were four times the standard, and their spirits drinks were six times the standard size. The majority of drinkers of each beverage were unable to accurately judge the size of their drinks, underestimating the number of fluid ounces by about 30%. Although the vessels methodology used here must be refined and tested further on other populations (e.g., men, nonpregnant women, and all ethnic groups), results suggest that determination of risk levels should be based on survey data that takes into consideration the beverage mix and the actual size of respondents' alcohol drinks. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Patients with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) often have difficulty functioning appropriately in everyday life and seem to employ poor problem-solving strategies. Tests of executive function are relevant for quantifying the functional deficits and underlying real-life problems associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This study considers two pathways for the effects of prenatal alcohol on executive function: a direct effect and an indirect effect through prenatal alcohol's effect on IQ. We compared 30 men who had been diagnosed with FAS or FAE with young adults participating in a longitudinal prospective study (n = 419) and 15 control participants that comprised a comparison group. This study is unique in its analysis of the same battery of assessments of executive function in both a large low dose longitudinal study sample and a clinically diagnosed group. Participants were evaluated on 9 tests (including 58 scores) of executive function. For some but not all of the tests in this executive function battery, the decrement in the alcohol exposure group is greater than would be predicted from their IQ scores. We found that 3 of 6 Stroop scores, 2 of 4 Trails scores, 9 of 16 Wisconsin Card Sorting scores, 1 of 2 Ruff's Figural Fluency scores, and 2 of 4 Consonant Trigrams scores appear to be particularly sensitive to the direct effects of prenatal alcohol damage for patients with FAS and FAE. The findings suggest that these executive function tests would be particularly useful in clinical evaluations of persons suspected of fetal alcohol damage because they would not simply reflect deficits in IQ or facial stigmata.

N2  - The association between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and an increased incidence of teratogenic effects has been well established. The most severe manifestation of this effect is the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by craniofacial malformation, grown retardation and developmental disability in affected children. Estimates of prevalence at birth of FAS range from 0,4 to 3,1 per 1000 births, depending on population, race, socioeconomic status, etc. Incidence is considerably higher among alcoholic women: approximately 30-40% in infants of alcoholic mothers. The minimum daily alcohol intake that affects the fetus and the mechanism of alcohol's toxic effect on the fetus are not well understood, but many studies have contributed to the understanding of these important questions. The following review focuses on major recent findings in this field.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, mental retardation, and neurodevelopmental disorders. In 1973, a cluster of birth defects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure was recognized as a clinical entity called fetal alcohol syndrome. More recently, alcohol exposure in utero has been linked to a variety of other neurodevelopmental problems, and the terms alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects have been proposed to identify infants so affected. This statement is an update of a previous statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics and reflects the current thinking about alcohol exposure in utero and the revised nosology.

N2  - Objective: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and less severe outcomes are typically diagnosed later in childhood, although earlier diagnosis of the effects of exposure would allow intervention in infancy and prevention of associated secondary disabilities. Identification is particularly difficult in such high-risk groups as low-birthweight infants. The goal of this study was to develop methods for early identification of at-risk infants. Method: Three methods (microcephaly, heavy episodic drinking [>5 drinks/occasion] in pregnancy and a cumulative risk index) identified neonates at risk for those developmental consequences of prenatal exposure that can be measured at 6 and 12 months (i.e., standard scores on Bayley Scales of Infant Development and growth measures). The usefulness of these methods was assessed by comparing those infants selected to an unexposed contrast group, while controlling for potentially confounding factors (e.g., race, socioeconomic status and birthweight). Results: At 6 months, when 70 infants were tested, trends were found for lower language facet scores and lower scores on the Behavioral Regulation Scale; at 12 months, when 134 were tested, alcohol-exposed infants had significantly lower cognitive facet scores (p < .02) and were more likely to be classified as either mildly or significantly developmentally delayed (p < .02). Conclusions: It is possible to identify infants at risk for alcohol- related developmental delays using information available in the neonatal period, although it is not usually done. Of the three methods tested, a cumulative risk index based on maternal characteristics was found to be most predictive.

T1  - Twelve-year follow-up of children exposed to alcohol in utero
A1  - Autti-Ramo I.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Eighty-two women who were consuming alcohol while pregnant attended a special clinic at the University Central Hospital, Helsinki with the aim of reducing heavy drinking during pregnancy. The children born to these women were followed up regularly. During their preschool years the children were assessed to have fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, pre- and/or postnatal growth retardation, or they were assessed to have normal cognitive and somatic growth. Of the original children, 70 of 82 could be traced st the age of la years. Through semistructured interview and contact with the health and social care authorities, information was gathered about schooling, family structure, whether help had been sought for behavioural difficulties and major adverse events in the family. The longer the intrauterine alcohol exposure and the more severe the diagnosis related to prenatal alcohol exposure, the more often the children required special education, were temporarily or permanently taken into care, and had behavioural problems. There is a considerable need for prolonged multidisciplinary follow-up and support of all children whose mothers have not been able to reduce drinking in early pregnancy, whether or not cognitive disturbances are evident in early childhood.

N2  - About 20% of pregnant women will drink alcohol, even though no universally safe level of prenatal alcohol consumption has been established. This study of 123 alcohol screen-positive pregnant women receiving a brief intervention in the 16th week of gestation examines the relationship of drinking goals, reasons for the goals, recognition of situations increasing risk of drinking, and subsequent antepartum consumption. While women who named abstinence as their antepartum drinking goal were more likely not to be consuming alcohol at the time of study enrollment (chi2 = 16.80, df = 1, p = .001), current drinkers who named abstinence as their goal did reduce subsequent prenatal alcohol use (chi2 = 10.04, df = 1, p = .002). All current drinkers who indicated fetal alcohol syndrome as a reason not to drink reduced their subsequent alcohol consumption (chi2 = 11.04, df = 1, p = .001). Future efforts may include the partners and support systems of pregnant women in education or intervention programs to reduce prenatal alcohol consumption to enhance their effectiveness.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To established the prevalence of fetal alcohol exposures; to compare physical, behavioural and learning patterns of children with significant alcohol exposure in utero with those of a group of children exposed to minimal alcohol; to assess the usefulness of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/fetal alcohol effect (FAE) score; and to provide feedback to parents, schools and communities. DESIGN: Parent questionnaire, complete physical examinations of children, psychometric tests of the children using elements of the Pediatric Early Elementary Examination (PEEX) and the Pediatric Examination of Educational Readiness (PEER), ADD-H comprehensive teachers rating scale (ACTeRS) score, the newly developed FAS/FAE Score, and the Brigance Comprehensive Inventory of Basic Skills to assess language and mathematical achievement. Testers were blinded to the results of the assessments and questionnaires. SETTING: Grades 1 to 3 at Sir Alexander MacKenzie School in Inuvik, Northwest Territories. RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of mothers reported frequent or binge drinking and 76% of mothers reported abstinence or moderate alcohol intake. There were significant ethnic differences; none of the Caucasian mothers reported frequently or binge drinking during pregnancy compared with 40% of Inuvialuit and 33% of Indian mothers. Children with exposure to frequent or binge drinking in utero had smaller palpebral fissures (2.3+/-0.1 cm versus 2.5+/-0.3 cm, P<0.01), smaller palpebral fissure to intercanthal distance ratio (0.77+/-0.05 versus 0.86+/-0.10, P<0.01) and smaller head circumferences (52.1+/-1.6 cm versus 53.62=1.6 cm, P<0.01) than those exposed to moderate drinking or abstinence. Children exposed to frequent or binge drinking in utero also demonstrated poorer coordination (P<0.005) and cortical function (P<0.01), attention problems, hyperactivity (ACTeRS), and poorer scholastic achievement in language (P<0.001) and mathematics (P<0.01) than their minimally exposed counterparts. In children in grades 2 and 3, a significant negative correlation was found between FAS/FAE scores and language (r=-0.55, P<0.001) and mathematical achievement (r=-0.28, P=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of drinking during pregnancy in the northern population studied was high, and exposure in utero was associated with physical abnormalities, difficulties with coordination and cortical function, and significant delays in language and mathematical achievement. The FAS/FAE score may be useful in predicting success or failure in language development.

Responses were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Results: Of the 60% of the obstetrician-gynecologists who responded to the survey, 97% reported asking their pregnant patients about alcohol use. When a patient reports alcohol use, most respondents reported that they always discuss adverse effects and always advise abstinence. One fifth of the respondents (20%) reported abstinence to be the safest way to avoid all four of the adverse pregnancy outcomes cited (ie, spontaneous abortion, central nervous system impairment, birth defects, and fetal alcohol syndrome); 13% were unsure about levels associated with all of the adverse outcomes; and 4% reported that consumption of eight or more drinks per week did not pose a risk for any of the four adverse outcomes. The two resources that respondents said they needed most to improve alcohol-use assessment were information on thresholds for adverse reproductive outcomes (83%) and referral resources for patients with alcohol problems (63%). Conclusion: Efforts should be made to provide practicing obstetrician-gynecologists with updates on the adverse effects of alcohol use by pregnant women and with effective methods for screening and counseling women who report alcohol use during pregnancy.

T1  - Parent ratings of behavior in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and IQ-matched controls
A1  - Mattson S.N.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Background: Behavioral disturbances are well documented in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. However, the degree to which these disturbances are related to factors other than alcohol, such as general intellectual functioning or socioeconomic status, is not known. Methods: Using the Child Behavior Checklist, parent-rated behaviors of children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were compared with those of a control group matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and verbal IQ score. Using this same questionnaire, children with fetal alcohol syndrome were compared with children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure that did not meet the criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome classification. Results: Data were analyzed by multivariate analyses of covariance. In the comparison of children with and without a history of prenatal alcohol exposure, significant differences were found on the competence, problem, and summary scales (all p < 0.05). For the secondary comparison between the fetal alcohol syndrome and the heavy prenatal alcohol exposure groups, there were no significant differences on any of the scales (all p > 0.10). Conclusions: These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure results in the significant and profound impairment of parent-rated behaviors and that these deficits are not explained entirely by the presence or absence of facial dysmorphology, general intellectual functioning, or demographic factors.

T1  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the hippocampus: Spatial behavior, electrophysiology, and neuroanatomy
A1  - Berman R.F.
A1  - Hannigan J.H.
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), characterized by growth retardation, facial dysmorphologies, and a host of neurobehavioral impairments. Neurobehavioral effects in FAS, and in alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, include poor learning and memory, attentional deficits, and motor dysfunction. Many of these behavioral deficits can be modeled in rodents. This paper reviews the literature suggesting that many fetal alcohol effects result, at least in part, from teratogenic effects of alcohol on the hippocampus. Neurobehavioral studies show that animals exposed prenatally to alcohol are impaired in many of the same spatial learning and memory tasks sensitive to hippocampal damage, including T-mazes, the Morris water maze, and the radial arm maze. Direct evidence for hippocampal involvement is provided by neuroanatomical studies of the hippocampus documenting reduced numbers of neurons, lower dendritic spine density on pyramidal neurons, and decreased morphological plasticity after environmental enrichment in rats exposed prenatally to alcohol. Electrophysiological studies also demonstrate changes in synaptic activity in in vitro hippocampal brain slices isolated from prenatal alcohol-exposed animals. Considered together, these observations demonstrate that prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in abnormal hippocampal development and function. Such studies provide a better understanding of neurological deficits associated with FAS in humans, and may also contribute to the development of strategies to ameliorate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behavior.

N2  - This study examined the effects of maternal periconceptional alcohol intake on polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations in human neonates. The area percentage of each fatty acid in cord blood serum from 12 infants born to control women (who consumed <2 mL absolute ethanol/d) was compared with that of 9 infants born to women whose periconceptional alcohol intake averaged >30 mL absolute ethanol/d. Periconceptional alcohol use was associated with a 30% increase in the proportion of docosahexaenoic acid (22.6n-3) in cord blood (3.0% of total lipid in control infants compared with 3.9% in alcohol-exposed infants; P < 0.01). The rise in the proportion of 22:6n-3 was responsible for increases in the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids and the ratio of long-chain n-3 to n-6 fatty acids (P < 0.055). Examination of the lipid-class fatty acid profile indicated that serum lipid alterations were localized to the cholesterol esters; 22:6n-3 in the cholesterol esters of alcohol-exposed infants increased 54% (P < 0.011) and arachidonic acid increased 55% (p < 0.005). The relative fatty acyl composition of maternal serum showed a significant increase in 18:0 fatty acids in the alcohol- exposed group (25%, P < 0.005) but there were no changes in the other fatty acids. The increase in the proportion of 22:6n-3 was unexpected but is consistent with the hypothesis that this essential lipid may be conserved selectively. These results imply that the lifelong neurobehavioral and sensory dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders may be due in part to PUFA dysregulation.

A1  - Loser H.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - All programs in prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) have been without success until now. Since the first descriptions of FAS in the early seventies the question arose, how the drinking pattern of pregnant women have changed and which maternal conflicts mainly inhibited prevention. Between 1973 and 1999 312 children with fullblown FAS and 119 with fetal alcohol effects were diagnosed, and their alcohol related historical data were assessed at the University Childrens Hospital in Munster. Only 93 mothers, all being alcohol dependent or abuser, could be asked postnatally in a trustful, structured interview as to their alcohol conflicts in pregnancy. The feelings of guilt and scruple, and the consciousness of being indebted to the damaged child are predominent. Many women did not know the real embryotoxic risk when drinking thoughtlessly and negligently in the first weeks of pregnancy. The own physical well-being could not be considered as separated from that of the child, mainly with alcohol dependent women. Social compulsion, trouble in partnership and the risk to lose the right of care for the child are further problems. Alcohol in pregnancy remains a problem which privately and in public is pushed away, concealed and displaced as harmless. Most of the preventive efforts in public failed to find an approach to alcohol drinking women and mainly to dependent drinker. Since alcohol is the most important damaging substance for the fetus with longlasting consequences, maternal conflicts and unchanged social attitude have to be considered as an essential cause of failed prevention.

T1  - Was the fetal alcohol syndrome recognized by the Greeks and Romans?
A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers/scientists are frequently quoted as expressing an awareness of potential harm associated with drinking during pregnancy. However, the statements attributed to these authors were not made by them. Instead, they are interpretations, presented in the form of verbatim statements, of their views relating to procreation. Although they did have something to say about the role of alcohol in procreation, it was the effects of drinking on the male body at the time of conception, and especially alcohol's effects on male body temperature, that concerned them. A cold body at the time of conception was believed to enhance the likelihood of conceiving a female, which to the Greeks and Romans was a 'deformity'.

T1  - Optic nerve morphology may reveal adverse events during prenatal and perinatal life-digital image analysis
A1  - Hellstrom A.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Objective: To evaluate optic nerve morphology in children with various conditions caused by adverse events during prenatal and/or perinatal life and to investigate whether optic nerve morphology can reveal brain lesions associated with these conditions, as well as provide insight into the etiology and timing of the prenatal and perinatal damage. Methods and patients: A digital image analysis technique was used to analyze fundus photographs. One hundred healthy Swedish individuals of various ages from childhood to adolescence constituted a reference group. The following patient groups were chosen to represent various clinical conditions affecting the newborn or fetus at different stages of development: children born preterm (N = 39), children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS [N = 16]), children with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL [N = 17]), and children with septo-optic dysplasia (SOD [N = 6]). Results: Preterm children without known brain lesions demonstrated normal optic disk morphology but abnormal retinal vascular pattern; children born preterm with an acquired brain lesion late in gestation (PVL) demonstrated normal disk size with enlarged cups in addition to the abnormal vascular pattern. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (FAS) had a subnormal optic disk area with increased tortuosity of both arteries and veins, whereas children born at term with an early acquired brain lesion (SOD) had a markedly reduced optic disk area with isolated tortuosity of the retinal veins. Conclusions: Evaluation of optic nerve morphology, by digital image analysis, demonstrated that differences in ocular fundus morphology were correlated with differences in etiology and timing of the adverse event occurring in prenatal and perinatal life. In addition, digital image analysis may be a helpful tool for understanding variations in optic nerve and retinal vessel morphology and their relationship with central nervous pathology.

N2  - Background: Children with heavy, prenatal alcohol exposure have well documented deficits in overall cognitive ability. Recently, attention has turned to the executive function (EF) domain in this population. Until recently, comprehensive measures of EF have not been available within one test battery. This study used a battery of tests to assess four domains of EF in alcohol-exposed children. Methods: The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Scale was used to evaluate EF in 18 children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with and without a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and 10 nonexposed controls. Children ranged in age from 8 to 15 years. Measures from four domains of executive functioning were analyzed: planning ability, cognitive flexibility, selective inhibition, and concept formation and reasoning. Tasks consisted of primary EF measures as well as measures of secondary component skills. Results: Alcohol-exposed children were deficient on EF measures compared with nonexposed controls. Furthermore, in most cases, children with and without the FAS diagnosis did not differ from one another. These deficits were not entirely explainable by concomitant deficits on component skills. Specific impairments were identified within the domains of planning and response inhibition, with additional deficits in abstract thinking and flexibility. Conclusions: Deficits in executive functioning were observed in alcohol-exposed children with or without the diagnosis of FAS and in the absence of mental retardation. Performance on these EF tasks provides insight into the cognitive processes driving overall performance and has implications for adaptive and daily functions. These results are consistent with anecdotal and empirical reports of deficits in behavioral control and with neuroanatomical evidence of volumetric reductions in structures within the frontal-subcortical system in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Chan D.Q.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) describes the systemic and ocular anomalies resulting from the teratogenic effect of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. It is a leading cause of preventable birth defects in the U.S. Case Reports: Two case reports illustrate the characteristic findings in FAS. These include growth retardation, cognitive impairment, and facial dysmorphism. Ocular signs are prevalent, including small palpebral fissure, microcornea, strabismus, myopia, astigmatism, and optic nerve hypoplasia. Discussion: Fetal alcohol exposure can lead to a wide spectrum of systemic defects and vision deficits. The increasing frequency of drinking among pregnant women in recent years should call more public attention to this detrimental yet preventable syndrome. Conclusion: The high frequency of ocular manifestations aids in making a diagnosis of FAS, which can be challenging. Eye-care professionals can play an important role in patient management and the educational process.

N2  - Background: Deficits in attention are commonly identified among patients who have been prenatally exposed to alcohol, and they often affect the ability of the patients to function appropriately in society. Methods: Eleven adult patients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) were compared with nine adult subjects with no history of prenatal alcohol exposure, using four tests of visually and auditorially mediated attention. Results: In relation to the comparison group, patients with FAS/FAE exhibited substantial deficits in both auditory and visual attention; the auditory deficits were greater. We observed two predominant patterns of deficits among patients with FAS/FAE, one involving both auditory and visual attention problems and the other involving less severe auditory problems and even fewer visual problems. Most subjects with FAS or FAE had some manifestations of attention problems in at least one of the tests of attention used in this study. We present a new graphical representation of individual auditory Continuous Performance Test data across a 6-min period, which, compared with conventional scores, more clearly reveals the markedly disrupted and variable attention patterns displayed by some individuals with FAS or FAE. Conclusions: These findings suggest that detailed analysis of the pattern of individual performance for each subject is an important aspect of Continuous Performance Test assessment. Our findings further suggest that intellectual performance (intelligence quotient score) alone is not sufficient to account for the patterns of disrupted attention for individuals with FAS/FAE. Assessment of individuals with FAS or FAE should include measurement of attentional functioning in both the visual and auditory modalities.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with widespread and devastating neurodevelopmental deficits. Numerous reports have suggested memory deficits in both humans and animals exposed prenatally to alcohol. However, the nature of these memory deficits remains to be characterized. Recently children with fetal alcohol syndrome were shown to have learning and memory deficits on a verbal learning and memory measure that involved free recall and recognition memory. The current study seeks to further characterize memory functioning in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure by evaluating priming performance. The choice of task is also relevant given previous studies of memory performance in patient groups with and without involvement of the basal ganglia, a group of structures known to be affected in fetal alcohol syndrome. Three groups were evaluated for lexical priming, free recall, recognition memory, and verbal fluency: (1) children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure; (2) children with Down syndrome; and (3) nonexposed controls. The children with Down syndrome showed significantly less priming than alcohol-exposed children, who did not differ from controls. In addition, the alcohol-exposed children were impaired on the free recall task but not on the recognition memory task, whereas the children with Down syndrome performed significantly worse than the alcohol-exposed group on both tasks. Finally, on the verbal fluency task, children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure were impaired on both category and letter fluency, but the degree of impairment was greater for letter fluency. These results further characterize the memory deficits in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure suggesting that in spite of learning and memory deficits, they are able to benefit from priming of verbal information.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Certain skin disorders are affected by alcohol abuse. Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy also gives rise to a typical malformation pattern in the child with a varying degree of severity (grade I-III). The diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is based on the detailed history of the maternal alcohol consumption in combination with the clinical, morphological, intellectual and psychosocial development of the child. The behavior of the child is also of diagnostic value. The grade of severity of the FAS can be determined during the first three years of life on the basis of a scoring system. In addition to medical care and surgical treatment of associated disorders, early support for the mental development of the child is of immense importance. Furthermore, the medical, social and psychological care of the mother must be considered. In the field of dermatology, knowledge about the pathomechanism of FAS is also important for its prevention in unborn children. Women of childbearing age presenting with dermatological signs of possible alcohol abuse, should alert the dermatologist to the possible risk to the child of FAS. Familiarity with FAS and the ability to recognise its clinical features are important for the adequate treatment and support of the affected child and for the mother suffering from alcohol disease, in cooperation with other treating doctors.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Background: Frequent alcohol use during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy can result in spontaneous abortion and dysmorphologic changes in the developing organ systems of the embryo, including the heart, kidneys, and brain. However, few population-based studies are available that describe the prevalence of frequent drinking (6 or more drinks per week) among women prior to and during early pregnancy (the periconceptional period), and the sociodemographic and behavioral factors that characterize these women. Such knowledge is fundamental to the design of targeted interventions for the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other prenatal alcohol-related disorders.Methods: This cross-sectional study used survey data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics as part of the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS). Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated using SUDAAN, and multivariate analyses were used to determine risk factors for frequent drinking.Results: Forty-five percent of all women surveyed reported consuming alcohol during the 3 months before finding out they were pregnant, and 5% reported consuming 6 or more drinks per week. Sixty percent of women who reported alcohol consumption also reported that they did not learn they were pregnant until after the fourth week of gestation. Risk factors for frequent drinking during the periconceptional period included 1 or more of the following: being unmarried, being a smoker, being white non-Hispanic, being 25 years of age or older, or being college educated.Conclusions: Half of all pregnant women in this study drank alcohol during the 3 months preceding pregnancy recognition , with 1 in 20 drinking at moderate to heavy levels. The majority did not know they were pregnant until after the fourth week of pregnancy, and many did not know until after the 6th week. Alcohol is a teratogen capable of producing a number of adverse reproductive and infant outcomes. Public health measures needed to reduce these potentially harmful exposures include alcohol assessment , education, and counseling for women of childbearing age, with referral sources for problem drinking, and family planning services for pregnancy postponement until problem drinking is resolved.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Children of women who abuse alcohol during pregnancy may be affected by varying degrees of neurological abnormality, even if they are not diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The extent of the behavioral deficits of the affected offspring may be a function of several factors, such as the differential vulnerability of the various regions of the brain-to-alcohol insult. In this study, groups of timed-pregnant rats were exposed to different doses of alcohol (EtOH 2.25, EtOH 4.5, EtOH 6.5 g/kg/day) or control conditions (maltose dextrin solution or no treatment) from embryonic day 1 (E1: sperm positive) to E20. On E33 (usually postnatal day 10), all pups were perfused. Their brains were removed, dissected into forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem, and weighed. Blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were measured on 4 different days of gestation, but the peak BACs across gestation for the three alcohol-treated groups averaged 142, 294, and 413 mg/dl for the EtOH 2.25, EtOH 4.5, and EtOH 6.5 g/kg groups, respectively. Analysis of the body weight data indicated that pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group had a greater somatic growth deficit than pups from all other groups. Although the whole brain, forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem weights of pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group were significantly smaller than those in the control groups, within-treatment group analyses indicated that the cerebella of pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group were more severely affected than were their forebrains or brainstems. The analyses of the brain region to body weight ratios revealed again that the cerebellum-to-body-weight ratio of pups in the EtOH 6.5 g/kg group was more severely affected than the forebrain or brainstem to body weight ratios. Collectively, these data lend support to the view that gross regions of the brain are differentially vulnerable to alcohol insult during the first two trimesters equivalent, and suggest that the cerebellum is vulnerable to injury from exposure to high BACs during a developmental period other than the third trimester equivalent.

A1  - Riley E.P.
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Background: It is widely known that prenatal alcohol exposure is related to cognitive and behavioral deficits throughout childhood and adolescence. Much research has focused on understanding and quantifying the cognitive profile of children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) with relatively less empirical research on behavioral or psychosocial adjustment. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral and psychosocial profile of children exposed to heavy amounts of alcohol prenatally. Method: Two groups of subjects were evaluated: an alcohol-exposed group (ALC) and a nonexposed control group (NC) each made up of 32 subjects matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. The alcohol-exposed group consisted of children heavily exposed to alcohol in utero, including 19 children diagnosed with FAS. The Personality Inventory for Children (PIC) was completed by the caretaker of each child. Four validity/screening scales and 12 clinical scales were scored for all subjects. Results: Analyses revealed significant group differences on four validity/screening scales and 12 substantive scales. Within the ALC group, the profile of children without FAS was similar to that of children with FAS, with the exception that their profiles were consistent with less cognitive impairment. Conclusions: These findings indicate that in addition to previously reported cognitive impairments, heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is related to significant impairments in psychosocial functioning. Even children without alcohol-related physical anomalies suffer from impaired psychosocial functioning. Because impairments of this nature can interfere with functioning across multiple domains, effective early intervention programs should be considered for families of alcohol-exposed children. Furthermore, given the similarities of alcohol- exposed children with and without FAS, it is imperative to obtain prenatal alcohol exposure histories on all children experiencing cognitive or psychosocial deficits.

N2  - Background and Objective: Liver transplantation for terminal liver failure enables patients to look forward to many years of good quality life. As a result, more and more of the often still relatively young transplant recipients enquire about the possible risks to a child procreated after transplantation. Patients and methods: During 9.5 years (between September 1988 and April 1998) 1000 liver transplantations were performed on 911 patients (374 females, 537 males) at our hospital. The potential for parenthood existed for 163 women (aged between 16 an 46 years) and 520 men. 14 children were born of 14 women, six pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion or miscarriage and three other women are now pregnant. Seven men reported paternity of eight children after transplantation. All data were collected prospectively. Results: Six of the 14 births (42.9%) proceeded normally, but up to three complications developed in the other eight (57.1%). Six women (35.7%) developed hypertension during the pregnancy. There was no case of transplant dysfunction or toxaemia of pregnancy. Half the births were by caesarian section. Premature births occurred in two women (14.3%); four children were underweight (< 2500 g) at birth (28.6%). The seven men, at a mean age of 44 (7-75) months after transplantation, fathered eight children, at present aged between 11 months and 6 years, all of whom have developed normally. The 13 children of the post-transplantation mothers are also without malformation or abnormal development. One child's development is retarded due to a fetal alcohol syndrome resulting from the mother's post- transplantation alcohol abuse during pregnancy. All the parents are well at present and live with their children. Conclusions: Both men and women can procreate at a relatively low risk to the offspring. But for this to happen, an informed decision for parenthood must be made by the prospective parent together with her/his partner and the doctor in charge, she/he must be in good physical condition with stable transplant function, and there must be frequent interdisciplinary monitoring during any post-transplantation pregnancy.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is currently the major cause of mental retardation in the Western world. Since FAS is not a natural phenomenon and is created by mixing alcohol and pregnancy, the solution to decreasing the incidence of all alcohol-related birth defects is therefore entirely preventable. To date, little is known about the effectiveness of prevention programs in reducing the incidence of FAS. Therefore, it is the intention of this article to review the effectiveness of prevention programs in lowering the incidence of FAS. The present review revealed that prevention programs, to date, have been successful in raising awareness of FAS levels across the groups examined. However, this awareness has not been translated into behavioral changes in 'high risk' drinkers as consumption levels in this group have decreased only marginally, indicating prevention programs have had minimal or no impact in lowering the incidence of FAS. Urgent steps must now be taken to fully test prevention programs, and find new strategies involving both sexes, to reduce and ultimately eliminate the incidence of FAS.

N2  - Background and objective: Maternal alcohol addiction in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE) in children. At present, little is known about the physical, mental, and social long-term consequences in adulthood. Patients and methods: Since 1974, 52 children with FAS and FAE, all born to alcohol dependent mothers, were prospectively followed up from birth to adulthood. Height, weight and head circumferences were based on percentile standards; mental and school development were assessed by school reports and by intelligence subtests. By structural interviews, occupational and social follow-up were assessed. Results: Growth retardation continued mainly in severely affected adults with underweight in 26%, underweight in 30%, and microcephaly in 46%. They mostly lived in foster families, only 6/52 were able to live independently. In 56% special schools for handicapped and mentally disabled were attended. In most cases (37/52), simple occupations without vocational training were practised. Conclusions: It is mainly the neurotoxic effects of alcohol in pregnancy that have longlasting developmental significance in adults. Because of the dysmorphic changes over time, it is difficult to diagnose FAS and FAE only in adulthood.

N2  - Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can result in central nervous system deficits in infants ranging from fetal alcohol effects to fetal alcohol syndrome. Changes in cerebral metabolism causing ischemic in utero conditions can also result from ethanol (EtOH). Growth factors have been shown to ameliorate ischemic damage and EtOH-induced neurotoxicity. However, using an in vitro model system of fetal alcohol effects/fetal alcohol syndrome, this study examines the neuroprotective effects of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor against EtOH treatment (0, 200, 400, 800, or 1600 mg/dl) combined with acute ischemia (2-hour hypoxia in EtOH-containing glucose-free media) followed by chronic hypoglycemia (16-hour glucose deprivation in EtOH-containing media). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assays assessed relative neurotoxicity. Glial cell derived neurotrophic factor was not neuroprotective. Nerve growth factor protected against ischemia/hypoglycemia combined with 0-1600 mg/dl EtOH. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor protected against ischemia/hypoglycemia combined with 0-800 mg/dl EtOH. These studies demonstrate marked growth factor neuroprotection against a myriad of conditions encountered by developing EtOH-exposed fetuses.

T1  - Identification of children with fetal alcohol syndrome and opportunity for referral of their mothers for primary prevention--Washington, 1993-1997
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Heavy maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy can cause permanent birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Although these alcohol-related defects are entirely preventable, the factors associated with maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy are complex and often resistant to change. In addition, not all women who drink heavily will produce children with FAS. Although targeting primary prevention efforts to all women at risk for drinking during pregnancy is ideal, limited resources require targeting women at the highest risk for producing children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. One such population is women who have already given birth to an alcohol-affected child. This high-risk population is not easily identified because not all children with FAS have their condition diagnosed, and these birth mothers are often separated from their children during the first few years of the child's life, often before a diagnosis of FAS has been considered. However, once identified, these women are receptive to intervention. To identify a population of women at highest risk for a future alcohol-exposed pregnancy through diagnosing a previously affected birth child, researchers at the University of Washington developed the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN). This report summarizes the results of this program and documents the feasibility of identifying persons who may have FAS so their condition can be diagnosed and their birth mothers can be identified and referred to prevention services.

N2  - Although Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) rates have been reported to be higher in American Indian populations, no screening tool has been validated for alcohol use in American Indian women. The objectives of this study were to compare the detection of prenatal alcohol use by a self-administered questionnaire to detection by clinical interview; and to ascertain whether the screening tool would increase detection of pregnant women who are abusing alcohol. The hospital records of the women were reviewed for any history of alcohol-related illnesses or injuries to compare with results obtained from the questionnaire. Seventy women attending their first prenatal clinic visit on a reservation were screened for alcohol use. There was a wide range in detection of prenatal alcohol use (20%-71% of the sample detected) depending on the method used. There was a large variation in sensitivities (7%-93%) of the individual questions in identifying patients detected as "high risk" by the clinicians. The T-ACE screening questions significantly increased detection of alcohol use compared to detection by the clinicians (p = 0.04 Fisher's exact test). Due to the large variation between different methods of detection, it is recommended that screening tools that increase detection of alcohol use should be combined with methods of higher specificity such as using questions about quantity and frequency of alcohol intake, medical chart review and clinical interview. We also found that various interpretations of the screening questions by the patients highlighted the need to tailor the wording of individual questions to the particular patient population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE) encompass a pattern of birth defects in persons whose mothers ingested alcohol during pregnancy. People with FAE display fewer of the FAS traits. AIM: To assess the prevalence and features of these affections in a secondary nutritional recovery centre. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All charts of children admitted between 1985 and 1995 were reviewed, and those children diagnosed as having a FAS or FAE by a geneticist were considered for this study. Birth, maternal, social and economic characteristics, psychomotor abilities (using Denver test) and response to nutritional treatment were assessed. RESULTS: During the study period, 1572 infants were admitted to the centre, and 1.97% (70% female) were diagnosed as having a FAS or FAE. These infants were admitted at 11.1 +/- 4.5 months of age and discharged after 96.7 +/- 58.1 months of hospitalisation. Mean mother's age was 33 +/- 7 years, and all belonged to low socioeconomic levels. Mean birth weight was 2048 +/- 431 g and 2469 +/- 619 g in children with FAS and FAE respectively (p < 0.03). Children with FAE performed better for gross and fine motor abilities than those with FAS. No differences were observed for language performance. Sixty five percent of children with FAS and 71% of children with FAE had an adequate weight and height increment during nutritional therapy. A multiple regression analysis showed that age at admission and gestational age were significant predictors of weight gain during therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol has teratogenic effects on the foetus that affect craneal size and psychomotor development. Alcohol also affects pre and post natal growth.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is commonly believed to be the leading known cause of mental retardation in the United States, although surveillance at state and national levels is problematic. The most serious consequence of fetal alcohol exposure is central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. While the facial features of FAS become more subtle with age, growth deficits and, particularly, the CNS impairment appear to be permanent. Among factors that affect the risk and severity of fetal alcohol damage are the timing of the alcohol exposure, binge drinking that produces high blood alcohol concentrations, polydrug use, and genetic variations. From various studies, the incidence of FAS ranges from 0.2 to 3.0 affected birth per 1000 live births. The methods of measuring FAS occurrence are fraught with difficulties and inaccuracies, as are surveys of alcohol use by women during pregnancy. Still, indirect studies both in Texas and the United States suggest that the occurrence of FAS is increasing. A first, important step to reducing the incidence of FAS and related problems is to increase the awareness of physicians and other health care providers about the issues of FAS diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Referral and information resources about FAS are provided.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - During pregnancy, the hormonal systems of the mother and fetus are intricately interconnected to ensure normal fetal development. Accordingly, maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can interfere with fetal development, not only directly, through adverse effects exerted by alcohol that crosses the placenta and enters the fetal bloodstream, but also indirectly, by disturbing the functions and interactions of maternal and fetal hormones. In both the mother and the fetus, alcohol exposure can impair the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which regulates the body's response to stress; the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which controls reproductive functions; and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, which regulates the metabolism of almost all tissues. In addition, alcohol can interfere with the activities of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors, which promote body growth and activity. Some of the effects of maternal alcohol consumption on fetal hormone systems may contribute to the adverse effects observed in children with fetal alcohol syndrome and related disorders.

N2  - Understanding the nature of cognitive deficits among adolescent patients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) can direct future research on assessment and intervention. In an exploratory study, nine nonretarded teenagers with FAS were administered tests of IQ and adaptive behavior, and neuropsychological tests presumed sensitive to alcohol effects. Their performance was compared with psychometric norms and to data from a sample of 174 adolescents with minimal or no prenatal alcohol exposure. These nonretarded FAS patients commonly showed behavior problems, decreased social competence, and poor school performance. Neuropsychological testing revealed significant deficits, although no one neuropsychological profile characterized all patients and not all tests revealed problems. Relatively intact performance was observed in procedural memory, some measures of reaction time, and some reading measures. Deficits were seen on attentional and memory tasks tapping visual-spatial skills, short-term auditory attention and memory, declarative learning, and cognitive flexibility and planning. Difficulties in processing speed and accuracy were also seen. Comparison with a subgroup of 52 nonalcohol-exposed or minimally alcohol-exposed adolescents with a similar range of IQ scores demonstrated that deficits among these FAS patients were not fully explained by a general lowering of IQ.

T1  - What do physicians know and say about fetal alcohol syndrome: A survey of obstetricians, pediatricians, and family medicine physicians
A1  - Abel E.L.
A1  - Kruger M.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Pediatricians, obstetricians, and family practice physicians in Michigan were surveyed by mail for their knowledge and opinions about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE). Physicians said that about 67% of their patients raised questions about drinking during pregnancy but only 2% specifically referred to FAS or FAE. Most physicians were uncertain about whether their colleagues were sufficiently aware of FAS, whether FAS could be diagnosed at birth, or if physicians were acquainted with the syndrome's major criteria. However, most believed FAS was not being overdiagnosed and believed that making a diagnosis of FAS at birth could lead to improved treatment of an affected child. Physicians also believed that physician counseling was a more effective way of reducing the incidence of FAS/FAE than warning labels. Forty-one percent of the physicians placed the threshold for FAS at one to three drinks per day and 38% placed the threshold at one or fewer drinks a day. Thirty-five percent placed the estimated incidence of FAS at 1 to 2 per 1000 in the United States. We conclude that physicians are in relative agreement about the effects of drinking during pregnancy and the value of physician counseling but are misguided as to what constitutes a true risk level of drinking as far as the etiology of FAS is concerned.

T1  - Diagnosing moral disorder: The discovery and evolution of fetal alcohol syndrome
A1  - Armstrong E.M.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was invented in 1973. This paper investigates the process by which a cluster of birth defects associated with exposure to alcohol in utero came to be a distinct medical diagnosis, focusing on the first ten years of the medical literature on FAS. Fetal alcohol syndrome was 'discovered' by a group of American dysmorphologists who published the first case reports and coined the term FAS. However, the nature of the diagnosis and its Salient symptoms were determined collectively over time by the medical profession as a whole. The paper traces the natural history of the diagnosis in the U.S. through five stages: introduction, confirmation and corroboration, dissent, expansion, and diffusion. FAS serves as an example of the social construction of clinical diagnosis; moral entrepreneurship plays a key role and the medical literature on FAS is infused with moral rhetoric, including passages from classical mythology, philosophy, and the Bible. FAS is a moral as well as a medical diagnosis, reflecting the broader cultural concerns of the era in which it was discovered, including a greater awareness of environmental threats to health, the development of fetal medicine, an emphasis on 'the perfect child,' and a growing paradigm of maternal-fetal conflict.

N2  - A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was performed with forty-six 5- to 9-year-old children exposed to alcohol in utero for varying durations. The children were subdivided according to duration of maternal alcohol abuse, as follows: during trimester I (n = 16), during trimesters I and II (n = 16), and throughout pregnancy (n = 14). A control group (n = 26) consisted of unexposed children. Fetal alcohol exposure throughout pregnancy had significant, diffuse effects on the development of the children, whereas exposure only during early pregnancy did not. Observed cognitive deficits included problems in naming, receptive language, attention, and visual-motor functions. Verbal and visual memory and manual motor precision did not significantly differ between the groups.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Alcohol is the most common identifiable teratogenic cause of mental retardation in North America. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a major public health problem, which is frequently under diagnosed by physicians. Objective: To identify and quantify the maternal risk factors and neonatal characteristics of children with FAS. Design: a retrospective case-control study using birth certificate data of North Dakota children diagnosed with FAS. Five controls were selected for each patient. Controls were selected from the computerized birth registry and matched by gender, gear and month of birth. Subjects and setting: A list of all the children diagnosed with FAS from the North Dakota FAS Registry was sent to the State Health Department. We were able to locate the birth certificates for 132 (56%) of the 228 cases on the registry. Results: Of the 132 FAS cases, 106 (80.3%) were Native Americans and 24 (18.2%) were Caucasians. In this sample 51 (38.6%) of the cases were male and 81 (61.4%) were female. Statistically significant maternal characteristics at p < 0.01 were: older mother's age, lower education level, fewer months of prenatal care, fewer prenatal visits, lower gestational age at time of delivery and less prenatal weight gain. Significant neonatal differences at p < 0.01 were lower birth weight and Apgar scores and higher incidence of congenital malformations. Conclusion: FAS is a completely preventable developmental disability. Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can result in lifelong physical and mental impairments on the fetus. All pregnant women should be screened for alcohol use during prenatal visits. Women with positive screens or at high risk should be identified early by the primary care physician and referred for treatment and counseling.

N2  - Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome in the end of the 1960s, substantial evidence has accumulated on a number of adverse effects that alcohol consumption during pregnancy may have on the fetus. Long-term effects on child development has also been observed. Although the various types of effects are well documented, less is known about threshold levels of consumption, under which there is no risk of damage. Few studies have assessed the risk associated with high episodic drinking. From a theoretical point of view, binge drinking in critical stages in organ formation may constitute a particularly high risk for adverse outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize for clinicians recent epidemiologic evidence regarding medical risks of alcohol use for women. METHODS: MEDLINE and PsychINFO, 1990 through 1996, were searched using key words 'women' or 'woman,' and 'alcohol.' MEDLINE was also searched for other specific topics and authors from 1980 through 1996. Data were extracted and reviewed regarding levels of alcohol consumption associated with mortality, cardiovascular disease, alcohol-related liver disease, injury, osteoporosis, neurologic symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, fetal alcohol syndrome, spontaneous abortion, infertility, menstrual symptoms, breast cancer, and gynecologic malignancies. Gender-specific data from cohort studies of general population or large clinical samples are primarily reviewed. MAIN RESULTS: Women develop many alcohol-related medical problems at lower levels of consumption than men, probably reflecting women's lower total body water, gender differences in alcohol metabolism, and effects of alcohol on postmenopausal estrogen levels. Mortality and breast cancer are increased in women who report drinking more than two drinks daily. Higher levels of alcohol consumption by women are associated with increased menstrual symptoms, hypertension, and stroke. Women who drink heavily also appear to have increased infertility and spontaneous abortion. Adverse fetal effects occur after variable amounts of alcohol consumption, making any alcohol use during pregnancy potentially harmful. CONCLUSIONS: In general, advising nonpregnant women who drink alcohol to have fewer than two drinks dally is strongly supported by the epidemiologic literature, although specific recommendations for a particular woman should depend on her medical history and risk factors.

T1  - Prevention of alcohol abuse-related birth effects - I. Public education efforts
A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy can result in a pattern of anomalies in children called 'fetal alcohol syndrome' (FAS) and more recently, 'fetal alcohol abuse syndrome (FAAS)'. FAAS as well as individual alcohol-related anomalies, called 'alcohol abuse-related birth effects' (AARBEs), are widely considered to be totally preventable, because they stem from a behaviour that is presumably modifiable. However, current strategies to reduce their occurrence are more palliative than preventive, because their underlying premise, viz. that raising public awareness of the potential dangers of commonly used substances such as alcohol is enough to reduce their use, lacks empirical support. Moreover, in some cases they are also counter-productive. After considering the relevant literature, this review contends that 'universal' public education efforts will only be effective in reducing FAAS and AARBEs if they focus on the cause of these disorders, which is alcohol abuse rather than the currently open-ended message that any amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy constitutes a danger to an unborn child. This argument lays the ground work for an alternative and more pragmatic strategy set forth in the following paper for preventing FAAS and AARBEs.

N2  - Objective: To examine the relative importance of prenatal alcohol exposure and family history of alcoholism for the prediction of adolescent alcohol problems. Method: In 1974-75, a population-based, longitudinal prospective study of alcohol and pregnancy began with self-report of alcohol use by pregnant women. In a 14-year follow-up, 439 parents provided information on the family history of alcohol problems for these adolescent offspring. The 14-year-old adolescents provided information on the frequency and quantity of their own alcohol consumption within the past month, on the consequences of their drinking over the past 3 years, and on their age at first intoxication. Additional covariates were assessed prenatally and at follow-up. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure was more predictive of adolescent alcohol use and its negative consequences than was family history of alcohol problems. Prenatal exposure retained a significant predictive effect even after adjustment for family history and other prenatal and environmental covariates. By contrast, the nominally significant correlation of family history with adolescent drinking is weaker after adjustment for prenatal alcohol exposure and disappears entirely after adjustment for other relevant covariates. We observed no evidence for an interactive effect of fetal exposure and family history in predicting adolescent alcohol use. Conclusions: Fetal alcohol exposure is a risk factor for adolescent alcohol involvement and alcohol-related problems and may account for variance in prediction of problems otherwise attributed to family history of alcoholism. Studies of alcoholism etiology and family history need to include consideration of even modest levels of fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - This research aimed to develop a Fetal Alcohol Behavior Scale (FABS) that describes the behavioral essence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), regardless of age, race, sex, and IQ. Using a reference sample of 472 diagnosed patients with FAS or FAE, ages 2 to 51, five studies are described. The FABS demonstrates high item-to-scale reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91) and good test-retest reliability (r = 0.69) over an average interval of 5 years. It identifies many of the subjects with known or presumed prenatal alcohol exposure in detection studies using both prison and general samples. FABS scores also predict dependent living among adult patients with FAS/FAE. The FABS is uncorrelated with IQ, sex, age, race, and diagnosis (FAS versus FAE). We outline areas of further work to define the specificity and utility of this FABS.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure and development at preschool age: Main results of a french study
A1  - Larroque B.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Very high levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are harmful for the central nervous system of the child and affect morphogenesis and growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on development at preschool age in a longitudinal study. Pregnant woman were interviewed on their alcohol consumption during pregnancy at their first visit to the maternity hospital of Roubeix, France. The development of their 160 children was assessed at the age of 4 1/2. Multiple regression analyses indicated that consumption of 1.5 oz of absolute alcohol (approximately 3 drinks) or more during pregnancy was significantly related to a decrease of 7 points on the general cognitive index of the McCarthy scales, after controlling for confounders. This level of consumption was also related to a higher score on minor neurological anomalies, a lower height of the child, and the higher score on facial features. This level of 1.5 oz of absolute alcohol/day should not be interpreted as a biological threshold, because the study does not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the effects of lower levels of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can affect the development of the child, at levels well below those associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is a devastating developmental disorder caused by prenatal exposure to high amounts of alcohol. In addition to structural abnormalities and growth deficits, fetal alcohol syndrome is associated with a broad spectrum of neurobehavioral anomalies. This paper reviews the behavioral and cognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. More than 20 years of research are discussed, with a focus on IQ, activity, attention, learning, memory, language, motor, and visuospatial abilities in children prenatally exposed to varying amounts of alcohol, including those with fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) produces profound alterations in immunological and neuroendocrine functions. The present study examined the effects of FAE on the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and corticosterone following administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in normal (N) adult rats, in adult offspring of dams fed a liquid diet supplemented with ethanol (E), and in pair-fed control offspring (P). LPS-induced TNF-alpha secretion was not affected by either gender or prenatal treatment. In contrast, LPS-induced corticosterone secretion was significantly greater in female than in male rats, and at 60-min post-LPS was significantly higher in E and P, compared to N females. Ovariectomy significantly inhibited LPS- induced TNF-alpha secretion in E, but not in P and N, rats and chronic replacement with 17-beta-estradiol markedly inherited TNF-alpha secretion in ovariectomized E and N, but not in P, rats. In contrast, ovariectomy reduced the effects of LPS on corticosterone secretion in all groups, and chronic replacement with 17-beta-estradiol reversed this effect. These findings indicate that LPS-induced secretion of corticosterone, but not TNF-alpha, is affected by prenatal manipulations and by gender. In addition, alterations in the hormonal environment in females modulate LPS-induced corticosterone secretion in all prenatal treatment groups, but differentially influence TNF- alpha secretion in rats exposed to alcohol, restricted feeding, or normal diets in utero.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The most devastating teratogenic effect of alcohol on the unborn child is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is a permanent birth defect that results in lifelong disruptions in cognitive, linguistic and social development. One of the most debilitating effects of prenatal alcohol exposure involves the development and use of social communication. Deficits in social communication jeopardize academic success and appear to play a major role in the maladaptive and dysfunctional behaviours present in older school-age children and adolescents with FAS. The ability to manage longer units of social discourse is a defining feature of adolescent language. Narratives are extended texts that occur frequently in the language of the classroom and in a variety of meaningful social contexts. The demands of narratives provide clinicians with a window of opportunity from which to examine the social-communicative processes of youngsters with FAS. In this paper we introduce an experimental protocol that has been designed to sample narrative discourse using a wordless picture book as the eliciting stimulus. Spoken narratives are scored for their cohesion (i.e. linking related events into logical networks) and coherence (i.e. informativeness). The clinical utility of the protocol is demonstrated and discussed, with a case presentation of two adolescents with FAS and a sample of typically developing peers.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: A Japanese perspective
A1  - Tanaka H.
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - To estimate and prevent the effects of prenatal alcohol on the central nervous system (CNS), brain dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE) was compared by both epidemiological and experimental studies. The FAS infants exhibited a more severe degree of CNS involvement than the FAE infants. The CNS involvement features were developmental delay and intellectual impairment in both FAS and FAE. The increased risk of low birth weight and CNS involvement were much more significant in women who were heavy drinkers or alcoholics and smoked. The beneficial effect of supplementary zinc on the fetal cerebrum of FAS or FAE rats was limited, never reaching the unexposed control level. One of the most vulnerable structures in the rat fetus exposed to ethanol in utero was the synaptic formation in the hippocampus. The consistent dysmorphogenesis of synapses during early brain development may be associated with the functional impairment of the CNS in FAS and FAE.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with behavioral and cognitive deficits. However, the majority of children born to alcohol-abusing women do not meet the formal criteria for FAS and it is not known if the cognitive abilities of these children differ from those of children with FAS. Using a set of neuropsychological tests, 3 groups were compared: (a) children with FAS, (b) children without FAS who were born to alcohol-abusing women (the PEA group), and (c) normal controls. The results indicated that, relative to controls, both the FAS and the PEA groups were impaired on tests of language, verbal learning and memory, academic skills, fine-motor speed, and visual- motor integration. These data suggest that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a consistent pattern of neuropsychological deficits and the degree of these deficits may be independent of the presence of physical features associated with FAS.

T1  - Birth weight and congenital anomalies following poisonous mushroom intoxication during pregnancy

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - A series of 22 women who suffered from mushroom poisoning while pregnant have been identified among adults receiving treatment between 1960 and 1993 in a specialist clinic in Budapest, Hungary. In most cases, the poisonings were attributed to Amanita phalloides, verna, and related species. Of these, 20 went to term, and data were collected on gestational age, birth weight, and both major and minor congenital anomalies. Mean birth weight (but not gestational age) was lower than in the control series, suggesting that maternal poisoning may have led to intrauterine growth retardation. Two children were identified with major abnormalities (one of whom had fetal alcohol syndrome related to alcohol abuse by the mother). The prevalences of both major and minor anomalies were similar to the prevalence in the matched control group and to the rate in a more recent control series examined according to the same protocols. However, the statistical power to detect teratogenic effects is limited, especially as only five of the mothers suffered the poisoning episode during the first trimester.

T1  - Surveillance for fetal alcohol syndrome using multiple sources -- Atlanta, Georgia, 1981-1989
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy and is characterized by specific anomalies of the face; prenatal and postnatal growth deficits; and a variety of central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, including mental retardation. Children with either full or partial FAS often incur severe and costly secondary disabilities. Despite the importance of surveillance for establishing the magnitude of FAS and in monitoring trends in the occurrence of this disease, population-based surveillance for FAS has been difficult because the syndrome can be diagnosed only by clinical observation and often is not recognized until after the child reaches school age. Although most FAS surveillance has been based on diagnoses among newborns, most (89%) cases (full FAS and partial FAS) are diagnosed after the age of 6 years. To develop a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of FAS in a defined population, in 1997 CDC linked data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) and the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP) for children born in Atlanta during 1981-1989 (the most recent birth year for which data were available for 3-10-year-olds). This report presents a multiple-source method for FAS surveillance that is more complete than previous methods and that enables comparison of rates between states.

T1  - Alcohol consumption among pregnant and childbearing-aged women--United States, 1991 and 1995
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Moderate to heavy alcohol use by women during pregnancy has been associated with many severe adverse effects in their children, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)--with facial dysmorphology, growth retardation, and central nervous system deficits--and other neurodevelopmental effects. Early prenatal alcohol exposure can occur unintentionally (i.e., before a woman knows she is pregnant); in addition, women who drink at high levels before pregnancy are at increased risk for drinking during pregnancy. Ongoing surveillance for alcohol consumption among pregnant and childbearing-aged women is important for monitoring the impact of efforts to prevent this risk behavior. This report analyzes and compares data from the 1995 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and previously reported 1991 BRFSS data for women aged 18-44 years, and presents the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women and overall and state-specific prevalence rates among women of childbearing age. The findings indicate a substantial increase in alcohol use among pregnant women from 1991 to 1995.

N2  - The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) utilizes a population-based survey of Oklahoma women with a recent live birth to examine the rates of alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy. Nearly one-half of Oklahoma women report using alcohol during the three months before pregnancy and one in thirteen women consume alcohol during the three months prior to delivery. Moderate to heavy alcohol use before pregnancy was associated with additional perinatal risk factors including unintended pregnancy, inadequate prenatal care, smoking, and physical abuse. Health providers play an important role in the prevention of alcohol related birth impairments such as fetal alcohol syndrome through early detection of problem drinking, patient education and appropriate referrals. However, one in four Oklahoma mothers report their health care provider did not talk to them about the harmful effects alcohol can have on their baby.

T1  - The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure
A1  - Larkby C.
A1  - Day N.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Exposure to alcohol during gestation can cause persistent abnormalities in physical and cognitive development. Children who meet the clinical definition of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) are small for their age, exhibit characteristic facial anomalies, and demonstrate deficits in central nervous system development. Alcohol effects in children with prenatal exposure, but not FAS, are similar, although of smaller magnitude and not necessarily present in all three systems. The degree to which a person is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure depends on the amount, timing, and duration of the mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy as well as maternal characteristics (e.g., age and comorbid psychiatric disorders) and environmental factors (e.g., socioeconomic status and family problems). Some exposure-related effects, such as growth deficits, are directly related to the amount of alcohol consumed, however, so that even a small amount of alcohol may affect child development. Therefore, the best policy continues to be abstinence during pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To assess general intellectual functioning in children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with or without the facial features and growth deficiencies characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Design: Forty-seven alcohol-exposed children were recruited on evaluation at a dysmorphology clinic and evaluated as part of a university research project using standard tests of IQ. Thirty-four of the alcohol- exposed patients met the traditional diagnostic criteria for FAS. The other 13 alcohol-exposed children lacked both the pattern of facial features and prenatal or postnatal growth deficiency characteristic of the diagnosis. Results: Compared with normal control subjects matched for age, sex, and ethnicity, both groups of alcohol-exposed children displayed significant deficits in overall IQ measures and deficits on most of the subtest scores. Although those in the nondysmorphic group usually obtained marginally higher IQ scores than those in the FAS group, few significant differences were found between the two alcohol-exposed groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that high levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are related to an increased risk for deficits in intellectual functioning and that these can occur in children without all of the physical features required for a diagnosis of FAS. They also emphasize the need for conducting a thorough history of prenatal alcohol exposure in children with intellectual deficits.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - PURPOSE: Heavy drinking during pregnancy is an established risk factor for fetal alcohol syndrome and other adverse perinatal outcomes. However, there is still debate as to the effects of low-to-moderate drinking during pregnancy. METHODS: This prospective investigation was based on 2714 singleton live births at Yale-New Haven Hospital during 1988-1992. Alcohol drinking during pregnancy was evaluated with respect to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preterm delivery, and low birthweight. RESULTS: Mild drinking, defined as > 0.10-0.25 oz of absolute alcohol per day, during the first month of pregnancy was associated with a protective effect on IUGR (OR, 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.76). Overall, drinking during month I of pregnancy suggested a curvilinear effect on growth retardation, with consumption of > 1.00 oz of absolute alcohol per day showing increased risk. Drinking during month 7 was associated with a uniform increase in the odds of preterm delivery; the ORs were 2.88 (95%'CI, 1.64-5.05) for light drinking and 2.96 (95% CI, 1.32-6.67) for mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the risk estimates for IUOR and preterm delivery may indicate etiological differences that Warrant further investigation of these outcomes and critical periods of exposure. Low birthweight is not a useful neonatal outcome for this exposure because it is a heterogeneous mix of preterm delivery and IUGR. Despite the observed protective effects of mild drinking on IUGR, the increased risk of preterm delivery with alcohol use supports a policy of abstinence during pregnancy.

T1  - DNA damage, DNA repair, and alcohol toxicity - A review
A1  - Brooks P.J.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Alcohol (ethanol) is clearly a toxic substance when consumed in excess. Chronic alcohol abuse results in a variety of pathological effects, including damage to the liver and brain, as well as other organs, and is associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancers. Alcohol consumption by pregnant women can result in fetal alcohol effects and fetal alcohol syndrome. All of these toxic effects are well documented. What is needed at present is a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which alcohol causes these toxic effects. Such an understanding may lead to better treatments of some of these toxic effects. This review, focuses on the possibility that toxic effects of ethanol are mediated at least in part, by damage to DNA. In particular, I emphasize data on the production of endogenous DNA-damaging molecules as a result of alcohol consumption and metabolism. Specific examples of DNA-damaging molecules to be considered are reactive oxygen species, including oxygen radicals, lipid peroxidation products, and acetaldehyde. The relevant DNA repair pathways that protect cells against DNA damage produced by these molecules will also be reviewed. The goal of this review is to integrate recent results from the fields of mutagenesis and DNA repair with the alcohol toxicity literature, with the aim of stimulating research into the role of DNA damage in different types of alcohol toxicity and the role of DNA repair in protecting cells from alcohol related damage.

N2  - Objective: To examine the association of moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure with learning and behavior in early adolescence. Method: A population-based cohort of 464 children were followed longitudinally from birth to age 14 years. Alcohol exposure was assessed via in-depth maternal self-report in the fifth month of pregnancy. At age 14, learning and behavior were assessed with multiple measures, tapping parent, teenager, and psychologist viewpoints, drawn from adolescent laboratory examination and parent phone interview. The underlying pattern of association between prenatal alcohol and adolescent outcome was detected using partial least- squares statistical techniques; confounding factors were dealt with by regression methods. Results: Analyses revealed a statistically significant, subtle relationship between greater prenatal alcohol use and increased behavior/learning difficulties during adolescence, even after accounting for other developmental influences. 'Binge' maternal drinking and exposure early in pregnancy were associated with a profile of adolescent antisocial behavior, school problems, and self-perceived learning difficulties. Conclusions: Fetal alcohol exposure (even at 'social drinking' levels) is associated with developmental difficulties in adolescence that are consistent with problems seen earlier in life. Clinicians should understand the potential role prenatal alcohol exposure plays in behavioral and cognitive problems.

T1  - Variation in induction of human placental CYP2E1: Possible role in susceptibility to fetal alcohol syndrome?
A1  - Rasheed A.
A1  - Hines R.N.
A1  - McCarver-May D.G.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in less than 10% of women who drink heavily during pregnancy. One potential mechanism for this intersubject variation is differences in placental alcohol metabolism, Alcohol dehydrogenase is present at low concentrations in the placenta and is not inducible. CYP2E1 has not been found in human placentas at early gestation time points or in random term placentas. Hepatic CYP2E1 is induced by alcohol and other environmental agents, but induction varies among heavy drinkers and may be genetically controlled. To test whether CYP2E1 is induced in placenta by heavy drinking during pregnancy, we performed a Western blot analysis on placental microsomes from women (n = 8) whose periconceptional average daily absolute alcohol intake was greater than 1 ounce. Using anti-human CYP2E1, bands consistent with CYP2E1 were identified in six samples, although considerable variation among individuals was observed. Among drinking mothers, offspring head size was smaller among those with placental CYP-2E1 (p = 0.04). The association between the presence of the protein and smaller birth weight and birth length was equivocal (p = 0.09). Our data are consistent with placental CYP2E1 being inducible by drinking, but with induction being variable among heavy drinking women. We speculate intersubject variation in induction may have a genetic basis and may play a role in susceptibility to alcohol related defects.

N2  - Background: Chronic alcoholism in pregnant animals and humans lead to general growth impairment in their offspring, which show multiple birth defects and delayed grown (fetal alcohol syndrome). Here we study the maturation of the intestine under the effect of chronic exposure to ethanol in utero together with associated malnutrition. Methods: Lactase, acid beta- galactosidase, maltase, and alkaline phosphatase activity profiles were monitored in 18-, 19-, 20-, and 21-day-old fetuses from rats kept under three nutritional treatments before and during gestation: alcohol-treated (25% ethanol in drinking water), fiber-treated (50% cellulose-diluted diet) as a control of the malnutrition associated with chronic alcoholism, and control or normal diet. Serum corticosterone determination and lactase immunolocalization were carried out. To detect possible direct effects of ethanol during the period of mucosa development, intestinal explants from 18- , 19-, and 20-day-old control fetuses were cultured either in the basal medium alone or in a medium containing 25 mM ethanol for 72, 48, and 24 h of incubation, respectively. Results: Following chronic ethanol exposure in utero, intestinal weight and brush-border protein content and the specific activities of lactase, acid beta-galactosidase, maltase, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly lower than those of nutritional controls. Organ culture results, under the assay conditions stated, did not show a direct effect of ethanol 25 mM on prenatal mucosal functionality. Conclusions: All these results suggest that maternal malnutrition is not primarily responsible for the impaired intestinal maturation in rat fetuses from alcohol-treated mothers; indirect effects of ethanol and/or its derivatives throughout embryo-fetal development could be necessary to promote this intestinal delay.

T1  - The teratogenic effects of alcohol following exposure during pregnancy, and its influence on the chromosome constitution of the pre-ovulatory egg
A1  - Kaufman M.H.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Much information has emerged over the years concerning the teratogenicity of acute and chronic alcohol exposure during pregnancy. Both alcohol and its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, are teratogenic. Exposure during pregnancy may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and this is said to occur in a substantial proportion of infants born to mothers who are chronic, heavy daily drinkers. Such infants usually survive to birth but are mentally retarded, often display growth retardation and additionally display a characteristic range of clinical features, principally craniofacial abnormalities and neurological damage. We have recently been interested in the effect of exposure of pregnant female mice to a single high level of alcohol during pregnancy, equivalent to an episode of 'binge' drinking, on the optic nerve, and believe that our findings, which are outlined in the first part of this review, may shed important light on the pathogenesis of some of the ocular features characteristically seen in infants with this syndrome. What is not generally appreciated, is that exposure to alcohol and other 'spindle-active' substances that have a similar action on the meiotic spindle apparatus during the menstrual cycle before conception can induce chromosome segregation errors in the ovulated oocyte. The successful fertilization of such eggs consequently results in the production of aneuploid embryos, which have a very high chance of being spontaneously aborted during the first trimester of pregnancy. Those relatively few aneuploid conceptuses that survive to term invariably show moderate to severe degrees of mental retardation, craniofacial and other abnormalities, as well as having a significantly reduced life expectancy. The findings from our experimental studies that have been carried out in mice draw attention to important principles which are of general applicability to the situation in the human. These findings, and our conclusions drawn from them, are discussed in detail in the second part of this review.

N2  - Behavioral deficits are often noted in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and other individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure, including mental retardation, learning problems, social problems, and deficits in attention. Because attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been diagnosed so frequently in children with FAS and other alcohol related birth defects, there has been speculation that alcohol is an etiological factor in ADHD. To examine the relationship between behavior characteristics of children with fetal alcohol exposure and those seen in children with a diagnosis of ADHD, 149 low socioeconomic status (SES), African-American children (mean age = 7.63 years) were given a battery of neuropsychological and behavioral tests. One hundred and twenty-two were a subsample from a longitudinal study of prenatal alcohol exposure, whereas twenty-seven were identified in an ADHD Clinic. Children were given two sets of teats: (1) 'traditional model' of conventional behavioral and psychiatric measures of ADHD and externalizing behavior; and (2) measures of neurocognitive functioning reflecting a four-factor model of the neurological basis of the components of attention (Mirsky AF, in Integrated Theory and Practice in Clinical Neuropsychology, Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1989). Results indicated that children with the physical characteristics associated with prenatal alcohol exposure and those with a diagnosis of ADHD had equivalent intellectual abilities with both clinical groups performing more poorly than contrast children from the same SES and ethnic groups. However, there were clear distinctions on behavioral and neurocognitive measures between the two clinical groups with those with ADHD performing more poorly on conventional tests sensitive to attentional problems and conduct disorder. When these two groups were compared on measures designed to measure the model of the four factors of attention by Mirsky, they were noted to have distinct patterns of deficits. These results suggested that the alcohol-affected children did not have the same neurocognitive and behavioral characteristics as children with a primary diagnosis of ADHD.

T1  - Was the fetal alcohol syndrome recognized in the ancient Near East?
A1  - Abel E.L.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - One of the most frequently cited examples of ancient prescience concerning the potential dangers of drinking during pregnancy is the story of Samson in the Biblical Book of Judges. The present article examines the relevant passages from this and other related Biblical texts for indications that the ancient Hebrews were indeed aware of alcohol's potential to harm the fetus. This examination was then broadened to include a survey of later Talmudic literature relating to drinking during pregnancy, and literature from Sumerian, Hittite, and Egyptian cultures contemporary with those found in the Bible. No evidence was found for concern in the ancient Near East about any possible harm.

T1  - Corticotropin-releasing hormone and proopiomelanocortin gene expression is altered selectively in the male rat fetal thymus by maternal alcohol consumption
A1  - Revskoy S.
A1  - Halasz I.
A1  - Redei E.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The present study was carried out to investigate how hormonal changes caused by chronic alcohol exposure of rats during the late period of gestation are coordinated with neuroendocrine functions of the fetal thymus, namely thymic expression of CRH and POMC genes. Alcohol consumption by pregnant dams led to a 5-fold elevation of plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels and significantly decreased fetal CORT levels. This generally inverse correlation between maternal and fetal CORT was absent in alcohol-consuming dams and their male fetuses on day 19 of gestation. These day 19 fetuses also had an attenuated plasma testosterone surge that occurred in the male control (pair-fed) fetus on day 19 of embryonic life. Furthermore, fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) resulted in a significant increase in thymic CRH and a decrease in thymic POMC expression in the male fetuses only, specifically on embryonic day 19. Thus, the strong positive correlation between CRH and POMC gene expression in the thymus of pair-fed male and female FAE fetuses was abolished in the FAE males. However, regardless of embryonic age or treatment, a strong positive correlation between thymic POMC gene expression and plasma testosterone levels in the male fetuses was detected. These data suggest that the sexually dimorphic effect of FAE on the fetal thymic POMC and CRH expression in males is driven by testosterone and may be related, therefore, to the presence of alcohol at the time of the prenatal testosterone surge in the male fetuses.

N2  - Several forms of cell perturbation have been associated with ethanol ingestion. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) as well as diminished maxillofacial development and inhibition of cell regeneration in vitro and in vivo have been described. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates maxillofacial growth, DNA synthesis, and it is a potent mitogen for a number of various cell types. EGF exerts its effects on cells through binding to a specific cell surface receptor which leads to activation of a thyrosine kinase in the intracellular part of the receptor. The inhibitory effect of alcohol on EGF in the mouse dental follicle was studied in the offspring of alcoholic mothers using immunocytochemistry. Adult female mice were given 22% alcohol in their drinking water and fed a pelleted diet before and during pregnancy. Maternal blood alcohol levels were 262 +/- 1.3 mg/100 ml on gestation day 12.5. The offspring of the alcoholic and control mice were sacrificed on postnatal day 1.5, their mandibles were dissected, weighed and processed by routine immunocytochemistry with the following results. 1) Significant differences were found in mandible weight p < 0.01 after parturition. 2) The tooth germs in the offspring of ethanol treated mice were morphometrically smaller than those of control littermates. 3) Immunoexpression of EGF in the mandibular first molar of the control group was strong and homogeneous while in the experimental group the expression was light and heterogeneous. It is concluded that maternal alcoholism reduces EGF in the offspring.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome: the nurse practitioner perspective
A1  - Quick S.
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause of mental retardation in the United States. The tragedy is that while FAS is irreversible, it is 100% preventable. FAS is caused by maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol is a teratogen and acts in different ways to produce physical and central nervous system malformations and defects in the developing embryo and fetus. FAS is characterized by a history of maternal alcohol ingestion, central nervous system dysfunction, growth deficiencies, and specific physical anomalies. Adolescents and adults with FAS have behavioral problems that differentiate them from other mentally disabled individuals. Nurse practitioners can have an impact on the prevalence of FAS by educating clients about FAS and its relationship to alcohol consumption. NPs need to carefully identify high-risk women and their partners before a pregnancy occurs and assist with interventions to stop active alcoholism or alcohol use during pregnancy. NPs have the capability to decrease the severity of alcohol's effects during pregnancy through education, counseling, and intervention. NPs have the skills to work with case-finding and early identification of infants and children who display signs and symptoms of FAS. With such case-finding, early identification, and prompt referral to the appropriate diagnostic and/or supportive community agencies, individuals with FAS can receive timely intervention to minimize the effects of FAS. Adults with behavioral problems can be assessed for FAS and referred for appropriate assistance as well. Finally, NPs can facilitate public awareness of FAS through educational efforts with individuals, families, and communities.

N2  - The consequences of fetal alcohol exposure are far-reaching and preventable. Health care providers are uniquely positioned to promote alcohol-free pregnancy, yet an array of factors inhibit routine screening, counseling, and referral. This descriptive, qualitative study explored experiences and perceived barriers related to prenatal screening for alcohol use. The study included eight focus groups (71 participants) and 41 key informant interviews with health care professionals representing a mix of disciplines. Nearly 40% of the providers were physicians who regularly encounter women in their practices. While most providers ask about alcohol use, few probe in depth or follow up. The findings should alert program planners and medical educators to strengthen their preventive medical and public health practices.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with a wide variety of cognitive deficits and behavioral problems. Little is known, however, about the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on visuospatial processing. Alcohol-exposed and normal control children were presented with visual hierarchical stimuli consisting of large (global) letters or shapes constructed from the arrangement of numerous smaller (local) letters or shapes. The children were asked first to recall the global-local stimuli and different single-level stimuli from memory and then to copy them. Alcohol-exposed children were impaired in recalling local features relative to global features. When the alcohol-exposed children attempted to copy the same stimuli, there was also a selective deficit in local but not global reproduction. A control condition indicated that the selective deficit in local processing was not due to a size effect per se. These results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure does not result in a unitary visual-spatial impairment, but rather, is manifested as a selective deficit in the visual processing of local (detail) features.

N2  - Nulliparous pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to ethanol via a liquid diet technique (FAE, fetal alcohol exposure) or administered a fixed amount of control diet from gestational day 11 to day 21. The offspring, at 2-3 months of age, were studied in tests of mechanically monitored motor activity and learning acquisition in an automatized testing cage requiring an instrumental discriminative response, where the ability to learn and relearn correlations of a light signal to water presentation was monitored. A significantly reduced activity (i.e. ramp mounting behaviour) in a novel situation was obtained in the FAE group compared to controls. The initial disruption of ramp mounting behaviour could reflect alterations in either habituation to a novel test situation, altered neophobia, or some retardation in associating these responses with the outcome of water-availability. Adult FAE rats (six months of age) showed a tendency towards a lowered acquisition performance (p = 0.06) when tested in a circular Morris-type swim maze, but no detectable differences were shown in a motor activity test chamber situation.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure may cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is associated with pre- and postnatal growth retardation. Materials and methods: Spontaneous 24-h growth hormone (GH) secretion was measured in six prepubertal short children with FAS (two boys and four girls) aged 4-14 years. The response to a GH stimulation test, and levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were also measured. Comparisons were made between the children with FAS and healthy children of both normal and short stature, as well as children born small for gestational age (SGA). Results: There were no differences in the mean area under the curve above the baseline or the maximum level of GH during a 24-h period (GH(max)) between the children with FAS and the reference groups. However, the estimated rate of spontaneous 24-h GH secretion in children with FAS was similar to that of children born SGA, but lower than in children of normal stature (p = 0.02). The plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were in the lower parts of the normal range. Conclusion: We conclude that GH secretion in short children with FAS is similar to that in short children born SGA; that is, in the lower range of normal children.

N2  - Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is a known cause of birth defects associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome, but its role in more common, isolated, craniofacial birth defects is not well understood. A population-based, case-control study of orofacial clefts was conducted in Iowa using births during 1987-1991. Cases were identified by the Iowa Birth Defects Registry and classified as having a cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) or cleft palate only (CP) and whether the cleft was isolated or occurred with other birth defects. Controls were selected from normal Iowa births. Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy was classified according to self-reported drinks consumed per month. Results are based on 302 controls and the following numbers in each case group: 118 isolated CLP, 56 isolated CP, 51 CLP with multiple defects, and 62 CP with multiple defects. Compared to women who did not drink alcohol during pregnancy, the relative odds of isolated CLP rose with increasing level of maternal drinking as follows: 1-3 drinks per months, 1.5; 4-10 drinks per month, 3.1; more than 10 drinks per month, 4.7 (chi-square test for trend, P = 0.003). Adjustment for maternal smoking, vitamin use, education, and household income did not substantially alter these results. No significant association was found between alcohol use and isolated cleft palate or clefts in children with multiple birth defects. Alcohol use during pregnancy may be a cause of isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a variety of cognitive deficits, notably in mathematics and higher order processes such as abstraction. An exploratory battery was developed to examine specific types of number processing impairments in 29 adolescent and adult patients with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) relative to controls matched for age, gender, and educational level. The battery included 11 tests: number reading and writing, exact calculation (addition, multiplication, subtraction), approximate calculation (selecting a plausible result for an operation), number comparison, proximity judgment, and cognitive estimation. The results indicated particular difficulties in calculation and estimation tests, with intact number reading and writing ability. The greatest impairment was found in the cognitive estimation test, which is sensitive to frontal lobe lesions. The patterns of deficit described may reflect either the diffuseness of brain damage incurred from prenatal alcohol exposure, or a cumulative deficit in comprehension which may be important for the acquisition of higher-order mathematical abilities.

N2  - Controversy exists whether carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) is valuable as a screening tool for fetal alcohol syndrome. We evaluated serum CDT in 60 non-alcohol-abusing women at different stages of normal pregnancy. CDT was weakly related to week of pregnancy and to human placental lactogen. CDT did not correlate with iron, oestradiol or progesterone. By contrast, good correlations were found between transferrin and week of pregnancy or either sex hormone. Using multiple linear regression analysis, only transferrin and week of pregnancy were important predictors of CDT. The diagnostic accuracy of CDT for detecting alcohol abuse may be limited in pregnant women and should be carefully assessed in relation to alcohol consumption.

T1  - Fetal alcohol syndrome - An ophthalmological and socioeducational prospective study
A1  - Stromland K.
A1  - Hellstrom A.
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Background. The eye is a sensitive indicator of adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Anomalies of the eyes and their adnexa are known to be associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), although long-term effects of these malformations are unknown. Design. A prospective ophthalmologic follow-up (median, 11 years; range, 4 to 19 years) was performed in 25 children with FAS. Their social situation and educational status were also investigated. Results. All but one of the children had ophthalmologic abnormalities. Fundus anomalies were observed in 23 children, of whom 19 had optic nerve hypoplasia. Thirteen children had concomitant strabismus. Microphthalmos, buphthalmos, phthisis, microcornea, coloboma of the iris and uvea, blepharoptosis, cataract, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, and nystagmus were observed in single cases. The dysmorphology of the eyes remained unchanged during the follow-up period. In 2 children with severe mental retardation and, initially, very poor vision, the severe visual handicap persisted. Seventeen children had an initial visual acuity >20/70, which remained unchanged in 10 children and improved in 7 children, despite the presence of optic nerve hypoplasia in 14 of the children. Ten mothers died, 8 of them because of alcohol-related diseases, and only 4 of the mothers were able to take care of their children. Sixteen children went to schools for the mentally retarded, and only 3 children had a normal school education without extra teaching assistance. Conclusions. In children with FAS, the major sequela, ie, brain damage, remains despite extensive medical, educational, and social support. The presence of ophthalmic signs, which persisted but did not deteriorate during the follow-up period, strengthens the diagnosis of FAS, and the high frequency of ocular involvement indicates the importance of a complete ophthalmologic evaluation in children with FAS.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - The risk of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is known to increase with increased maternal age and parity. This study investigated the hypothesis that the deficits in growth and intellectual function seen in non-FAS infants exposed to alcohol at moderate-to-heavy levels are also found disproportionately in the offspring of older mothers. Mothers of 480 African- American, inner-city infants were interviewed at each prenatal clinic visit regarding their use of alcohol during pregnancy. Infants were assessed for physical growth and cognitive development repeatedly through age 13 months. In analyses run separately for the infants of younger and older mothers, alcohol-related deficits were seen most strongly in the offspring of women over 30 years of age. This pattern was not caused by lower levels of drinking by the younger mothers. Age-related increases in maternal body fat-to-water ratio and a faster rate of alcohol metabolism in chronic drinking women may account for the greater vulnerability of the offspring of the older mothers. These data suggest that physiological changes associated with aging and/or chronic drinking may play an important role in the alcohol-related birth defects seen in infants exposed at moderate-to-heavy levels.

N2  - Objective: To determine the knowledge, clinical experience and perceived needs for resource materials of Saskatchewan physicians in regard to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related birth defects. Design: Mailed survey. Setting: Saskatchewan. Participants: All 48 pediatricians and half (394) of the family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) practising in Saskatchewan received a questionnaire. The numbers of physicians who completed it were 24 and 249 respectively. Results: The pediatricians were more likely than the other physicians to be aware of FAS and to have diagnosed at least one case of FAS. Among the FPs and GPs, the year of graduation from medical school was a significant factor in their knowledge of FAS and their diagnostic practices. Those who graduated before 1974, the year FAS was first described in the medical literature, were less likely than the more recent graduates to be aware of FAS and to ask their patients about alcohol use during pregnancy but were more likely to feel comfortable discussing alcohol-related issues in families. All of the groups reported a need for more information about FAS and for resources on alcohol-related issues in general. Conclusions: Saskatchewan physicians are aware of FAS but have expressed a need for more information about FAS, particularly for parents, as well as physician training materials and information about where to refer patients with FAS and parents with alcohol-related problems.

T1  - The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in New Zealand

A1  - Marks R.E.
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - AIMS. To obtain an estimate of the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in New Zealand and to report information on paediatrician surveillance for alcohol related birth defects. METHODS. New Zealand paediatricians were asked to complete a postal survey. Questions recorded the number of children with alcohol related birth defects under their care, and examined the respondents' surveillance for alcohol related birth defects. RESULTS. There were 63 children under 10 years of age with fetal alcohol syndrome under paediatric care in 1993. The majority of paediatricians considered the diagnosis only when risk features were identified: the most frequent being children of high risk mothers and children with dysmorphic features. CONCLUSIONS. Fetal alcohol syndrome exists in New Zealand. The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome as estimated in this study is lower than would be expected from international prevalence reports and is likely to be an underestimate. Current surveillance for alcohol related birth defects depends on an individual paediatrician considering the diagnosis only when faced with a perceived at risk infant or child, and there is likely under recognition. An increased awareness of the risks of alcohol consumption in pregnancy and the full spectrum of alcohol related birth defects is required.

T1  - Use of international classification of diseases coding to identify fetal alcohol syndrome--Indian Health Service facilities, 1981-1992
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is one of the leading causes of preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States (1). Since 1979, surveillance systems for estimating and tracking FAS have categorized cases using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code 760.71 (2). This code comprises noxious influences affecting the fetus or newborn through placenta or breast milk, specifically alcohol, and includes FAS. Because the code is not specific for FAS and may reflect maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy or other adverse effects of alcohol on the fetus, CDC assessed the usefulness of this code in ascertaining FAS cases by reviewing medical records for 1981-1993 from the Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service (IHS) and IHS contract facilities in eight of the 19 tribal or American Indian communities in the area. This report summarizes the findings of the analysis.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) refers to a pattern of birth defects occurring in a subpopulation of children born to women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. The significant medical, social, and economic impact of FAS is increasing. Particularly hard-hit are African-American and native-American women and children. Over the past two decades, basic and clinical research produced voluminous data on ethanol effects on developing organisms. In 1991, Duester and Pullarkat proposed that competition of ethanol with retinol at the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) binding site formed the basis of the FAS mechanism. This competition adversely affects the developing fetus caused by deregulation of retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis essential for proper fetal tissue development. Stated concisely, the FAS hypothesis is: 1. Class I ADH catalyzes the rate-limiting step in oxidation of retinol (ROH) to RA, and ethanol (ETOH) to acetic acid, thus establishing competition for AOH between ROH and ETOH. 2. RA is required as a signal molecule for cell differentiation critical for normal fetal morphogenisis. 3. ADH hinds ingested ETOH, thus deregulating RA homeostasis leading to improper RA signal transduction. Preliminary results from molecular modeling studies of ROH-ADH and ETOH-ADH structures, and physiologic pharmacokinetic modeling confirm the hypothesis with remarkable fidelity.

N2  - Objectives. This study investigated the effect of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on psychomotor development of preschool-age children in a longitudinal study. Methods. Pregnant women were interviewed about their alcohol consumption at their first visit to the maternity hospital in Roubaix, France. Alcohol consumption before pregnancy and during the first trimester was assessed with a structured questionnaire. The psychomotor development of 155 children of these women was assessed with the McCarthy scales of children's abilities when the children were about 4 1/2 years old. Results. Consumption of 1.5 oz of absolute alcohol (approximately three drinks) or more per day during pregnancy was significantly related to a decrease of 7 points in the mean score on the general cognitive index of the McCarthy scales, after gender, birth order, maternal education, score for family stimulation, family status, maternal employment, child's age at examination, and examiner were controlled for. Conclusions. This study showed that moderate to heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy, at levels well below those associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, has effects on children's psychomotor development.

T1  - Is moderate alcohol intake in pregnancy associated with the craniofacial features related to the fetal alcohol syndrome?

N2  - Social drinking in pregnancy is common in many countries despite the fact that alcohol in high doses has teratogenic properties. The public health implications would be appreciable if even moderate alcohol consumption were associated with embryonal or fetal maldevelopment. A presumably sensitive marker of an alcohol effect was used in this study, namely the fetal craniofacial features included in the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The study was based upon self-reported alcohol intake and photographs taken at birth or at 18 months of children born to mothers with a low or moderate alcohol intake during pregnancy. These women were selected during pregnancy by a two-stage sampling from all in well defined regions. Data were available concerning 323 pregnant women and some 200 to 220 children. A short palpebral fissure, a short nose to upper-lip distance and a broad root of the nose were expected to be associated with alcohol intake in early pregnancy, but such an association was only seen between binge drinking and a short palpebral fissure. No associations proved statistically significant at the 18-month examination and any association could merely be secondary to the known association between alcohol and birth weight.

N2  - For 20 years, it has been known that fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with abnormal brain development. Early autopsy studies point to the corpus callosum as one area affected by heavy alcohol exposure. Little is known, however, about the integrity of the brain in alcohol-exposed children who survive the perinatal period. This study was designed to assess the corpus callosum in living children exposed to high doses of alcohol prenatally. Thirteen children with histories of significant prenatal alcohol exposure and 12 normal control children were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. Using the midsagittal section, images were measured for the area of the corpus callosum using a computer-assisted measurement technique. In addition to the overall area, five equiangular regions were determined for each corpus callosum. Of the 13 alcohol-exposed children assessed, two had agenesis of the corpus callosum. The remaining alcohol- exposed children had significantly smaller overall callosal areas, as well as smaller regional areas of four of the five callosal regions, when compared with the normal control children. Importantly, when corrected for brain size, three of the five callosal regions were still smaller in the alcohol-exposed children, although overall area of the corpus callosum was no longer significantly different. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol is associated with abnormalities of the corpus callosum. They verify callosal agenesis in children with FAS, which previously had only been noted in autopsy reports. The current findings further document selective reductions in the area of certain regions of the corpus callosum after in utero alcohol exposure, extending our current understanding of alcohol's teratogenic effects on brain development. There is also some indication that the selective reduction in the area of the corpus callosum is similar to that reported in attention deficit disorder.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol-related birth defects are the result of heavy maternal alcohol consumption during gestation. The magnitude of deficit manifested by the offspring is invariably a consequence of several risk factors that may result in high peak blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), such as the duration, timing, or pattern of alcohol consumption. In addition, the alcohol content of the consumed beverage may play a role in determining offspring developmental consequences. Because higher BACs are positively correlated with risk and severity of brain injury early in postnatal life, initially it was important to determine how BAC is influenced by alcohol concentration and whether that influence is constant over repeated alcohol treatments. Groups of female Sprague-Dawley rate received daily intragastric intubations of 5 g/kg alcohol in one of several concentrations: 45% (v/v), 30% (v/v), 22.5% (v/v), or 15% (v/v) for a duration of 18 consecutive days. Blood samples were taken at various times postintubation on days 3, 8, 13, and 18 of treatment, and analyzed by headspace gas chromatography. Multivariate analyses of peak BAC, average BAC, and time to reach peak BAC revealed some noteworthy results. First, peak BAC and average BAC were significantly lower in the 45% group, compared with the other concentration groups, whereas this group also took a longer time to reach peak BAC than the other three groups. Second, peak BAC and average BAC were higher on the last day of treatment than any of the other treatment days. These results suggest that alcohol concentration and repeated alcohol exposure can influence BAC and, as such, are important risk factors to be considered in the appraisal of alcohol-induced fatal brain injuries.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with a cluster of symptoms called Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with a characteristic pattern of neuroanatomy and biochemical changes. In recent years it has been shown, that stress exposed cells rapidly increase transcription and translation of heat shock protein genes resulting in an increased appearance of these proteins. It has also been found that heat shock proteins, especially the HSP70 family play a role as molecular chaperons maintaining the native conformation of proteins and participating in protein transport in particular cellular compartments. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chronic maternal alcohol consumption on HSP70 content in the different regions of the brain of the newborn rats as well as to examine in vitro the effect of ethanol on HSP70 content in cultured glial cells. Chronic maternal ethanol consumption resulted in increased HSP70 in the following regions of developing brain: hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory bulbs, frontal cortex and septum. Moreover, ethanol applied in vitro, increased HSP70 content in primary astroglial cultures and astrocytes but not in oligodendrocyte cultures. The above described changes may be important in brain maturation and may play a role in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

T1  - Maternal risk factors in fetal alcohol syndrome: Provocative and permissive influences
A1  - Abel E.L.
A1  - Hannigan J.H.
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - We present an hypothesis integrating epidemiological, clinical case, and basic biomedical research to explain why only relatively few women who drink alcohol during pregnancy give birth to children with alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), in particular, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). We argue that specific sociobehavioral risk factors, e.g., low socioeconomic status, are permissive for FAS in that they provide the context for increased vulnerability. We illustrate how these permissive factors are related to biological factors, e.g., decreased antioxidant status, which in conjunction with alcohol, provoke FAS/ARBDs in vulnerable fetuses. We propose an integrative heuristic model hypothesizing that these permissive and provocative factors increase the likelihood of FAS/ARBDs because they potentiate two related mechanisms of alcohol-induced teratogenesis, specifically, maternal/fetal hypoxia and free radical formation.

N2  - Although insulin is known to be an important generator of regulatory signals during fetal growth and development, neither the immediate nor long- term effects of alcohol (ethanol) on insulin action are well understood. In the rat, fetal exposure to alcohol has been shown to be correlated with a subsequent abnormal response to a glucose load in the neonate and adult. Further, fetal hypoplasia secondary to maternal alcohol consumption is correlated with decreased placental glucose transport and with a lowering of the glucose levels in fetal tissues. However, the fetal effects of alcohol cannot be completely overcome by glucose/caloric supplementation, suggesting that factors other than glucose transport are involved. Using an embryonic chick model that negates the factors of maternal/placental metabolism and transport, the current study found that fetal alcohol exposure markedly increased insulin binding in developing tissue, but had little effect on the binding of the insulin-like growth factors. Competitive binding experiments revealed a marked increase in insulin receptor numbers, but no change in binding affinity as a result of the alcohol exposure. Basal uptake of 2- deoxyglucose by fetal tissue was lowered by alcohol exposure, but incubation with exogenous porcine insulin (1 x 10-7 M) resulted in a significant increase in glucose uptake by the alcohol-exposed embryos. The increases in insulin binding and in insulin-dependent glucose uptake notwithstanding, exogenous insulin could not induce normal levels of ornithine decarboxylase activity in embryonic cells previously exposed to alcohol. Furthermore, insulin treatment seemed to inhibit growth in alcohol-exposed whole embryos. Molecular changes in the insulin signaling cascade occurring as the result of alcohol exposure included an increase in specific phosphotyrosine content that was markedly decreased following insulin stimulation. The decrease in phosphotyrosine content did not seem to involve the insulin receptor substrate-1:phosphoinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase complex, because alcohol-treated embryos had significantly elevated basal PI-3 kinase activity that was not altered by insulin exposure. In summary, alcohol-induced growth suppression in the chick embryo is associated with several changes in insulin signaling and thus data suggest that this important mitogenic pathway is impaired as the result of fetal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Fetal alcohol syndrome, a syndrome which included growth retardation, mental retardation, and dysmorphic facial features, has been observed only among children of alcoholic mothers, who drank alcohol during pregnancy. But it is now established that consuming about 2 or 3 alcoholic drinks per day during pregnancy can induce permanent damage of the central nervous system, with various functional deficits and delayed mental development. The seriousness of the damage seems to be related to the duration of exposure during pregnancy. Occasional heavy consumptions ('binge' drinking) seem to produce similar effects.

T1  - Prenatal alcohol exposure selectively suppresses cell-mediated but not humoral immune responsiveness
A1  - Gottesfeld Z.
A1  - Ullrich S.E.
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - The present study examined effects of fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) on the ability of peripubertal male and female rats to mount a humoral immune response against T-cell-dependent as well as independent antigens. The appropriate pair-fed (PF) and control (C) cohort rats were included. Serum immunoglobulins (Ig) levels were determined following a primary or secondary immune response. In addition, plasma corticosterone levels were measured in conscious, freely moving FAE, PF and C rats following sensitization with the T-cell-dependent antigen sheep red blood cells (SRBC). The study demonstrates that, in response to primary or secondary immunization, serum Ig levels in FAE rats were not significantly different from those in the PF or C cohorts. On the other hand, a marked reduction in mitogen-induced T-cell proliferative response was observed in FAE male rats in the same age group. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were increased almost four-fold 7 days after the primary immunization with SRBC, but there were no significant differences among the FAE, PF or C groups. Taken together, evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies indicates that FAE is associated with a selective impairment of cell-mediated immune function, including mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation, graft versus host as well as contact sensitization responses, but not of humoral immune function.

N2  - Optic nerve hypoplasia is commonly observed in children affected by the fetal alcohol syndrome, and is believed to contribute to their poor visual acuity. We have used a 'binge' model of alcohol abuse in an attempt to recreate this hypoplasia in a mouse model. Pregnant female (C57BL/6 x CBA)F1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of a 25% solution of ethanol (v:w), either on d 11 or d 12 of gestation. Optic nerves were prepared for transmission electron microscopy from offspring at 3, 6, 9 and 15 wk of age (n = 64). A systematic random sampling technique was used to analyse both the cross-sectional areas of the optic nerves from semithin sections, and the numbers and cross-sectional areas of myelinated axons from thin sections. We found no significant differences either in the cross-sectional area or in the number of axons in the optic nerves between 3 and 9 wk from control and alcohol-treated groups. From 9 to 15 wk, alcohol-treated groups showed a loss of approximately 25% of myelinated axons (65931 +/- 2806-49186 +/- 3194: mean number of axons +/- S.E.M., respectively). Over the same period the number of axons in control groups was relatively stable (62087 +/- 2043-64703 +/- 3607). This resulted in an optic nerve with statistically significantly fewer myelinated axons at 15 wk in the alcohol-treated group, and was reflected in a trend towards a smaller cross-sectional area of the optic nerve in alcohol-treated groups. Analysis of axon calibre distribution within the optic nerves suggested that axons of all sizes were lost between 9 and 15 wk in the alcohol-treated groups. We suggest a delayed trophic mechanism for this late axon loss, and that the term optic nerve atrophy may be a more accurate description of the process.

N2  - Capture-recapture methods were used to estimate the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among Alaska Natives born during the period 1982-1989. Potential cases were identified through an Indian Health Service (IHS) patient case file, a pediatric practice case file, and Medicaid claims from private physicians. A total of 74 Alaska Native children aged 3-10 years were identified with a notation of fetal alcohol syndrome by a physician in a medical record. Because not all of these cases had supporting documentation regarding the syndrome, they were classified as possible cases. Of these possible cases, 50 met all five criteria for chart verification of the syndrome: physician notation of fetal alcohol syndrome, growth deficiency, facial features of the syndrome, central nervous system impairment, and a maternal history of alcohol abuse. These data provided observed prevalence rates of chart-verified fetal alcohol syndrome of 3.1 per 1,000 live births for children born 1982-1985 (age 7-10 years), and 2.0 per 1,000 live births for children born 1986-1989 (age 3-6 years). Capture-recapture analyses were conducted using cases identified by IHS and private physicians. These analyses estimated a prevalence of the syndrome of 3.8 per 1,000 live births for children born 1982-1985, and 3.1 per 1,000 live births for children born 1986-1989. Based on the capture-recapture predicted number of cases, the IHS case file ascertained a greater percentage of cases among the older cohort (75%) than among the younger cohort (56%). These data illustrate the use of capture-recapture analyses in identifying the extent to which observed trends in rates may reflect differences in case ascertainment over time (or by birth cohort). The application of capture-recapture in fetal alcohol syndrome surveillance, however, requires careful attention to the underlying assumptions of capture-recapture methods.

T1  - Frequent alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age--Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1991
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome and other congenital anomalies. Substantial prenatal alcohol use can occur before a woman knows she is pregnant, and teratogenic risk increases if she continues to drink during pregnancy. Characterization of alcohol consumption patterns among women of childbearing age (i.e., age 18-44 years) can help identify the magnitude of this problem, the subpopulations at greatest risk, and the geographic areas in which increased prevention efforts are needed. This report presents state-specific data on the prevalence of frequent alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy often results in disorders of fetal development (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome). The brain appears to be particularly vulnerable, and alcohol abuse during pregnancy is probably the most common cause of acquired mental retardation. We therefore studied the in vitro effects of ethanol on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)- mediated proliferation of rat C6 glioblastoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The proliferation of C6 rat glioblastoma cells was measured in serum-free medium supplemented with specific growth factors in the presence or absence of ethanol. The effect of ethanol on IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, as was the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase content within IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. RESULTS: C6 cells grew slowly in serum-free medium and proliferated in response to IGF-1. Ethanol, at physiologically tolerated concentrations, markedly inhibited the growth of C6 cells in response to IGF-1, but had no effect on the proliferative rate in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor or 1% fetal bovine serum. Inhibition of cell proliferation was evident when ethanol was only present during a 1-hour pulse of IGF-1. Cell growth in the presence of IGF-2 was also prevented by ethanol. The inhibition of IGF-1-mediated cell proliferation was accompanied by abrogation of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation. Ethanol also interfered with the IGF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and the association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with IRS-1. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol inhibit the responses of glial cells to IGF-1, including IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation, IRS-1 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activation, and cell growth.

N2  - In a cohort of 532 pregnant women from the general population, it was found by compilation of the results from interviews, police records, hospital records and social welfare records that 23 mothers and 51 fathers in 64 families (12%) were suffering from alcoholism/heavy drinking. In these 64 families, the mother was an addict in only 13 families, both parents were addicts in 10 families, and in the remaining 41 families only the father was an addict. Pregnancy, delivery, the newborn child and the child's development until their fourth year of life have been described using a multidisciplinary approach and a longitudinal prospective design. An hypothesis on mental and physical development, and the occurrence of psychopathological symptoms in the children was tested. None of the children of the 13 alcoholic mothers was born with foetal alcohol syndrome, but foetal hazard was indicated by lower birth weight and a higher rate of perinatal deaths. Children of alcoholic parents had retarded mental development and showed more behavioural problems until 4 years of age than controls, but the differences related to physical development during the first year of life had then disappeared. Boys were found to be more vulnerable than girls. The consequences of behaviour seemed to be more pronounced when both parents were alcoholics. No obvious deviation was found when only the father was addicted. Regarding mental development, it appears that factors related to parental alcoholism, including genetic and social factors' and the sex of the child, are of greater importance than the neonatal score on reduced optimality.

N2  - The most notable features of fetal alcohol syndrome involve the face and eyes, and include microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, an underdeveloped philtrum and a thin upper lip. Evidence of intrauterine or postnatal growth retardation, mental retardation or other neurologic abnormalities, and at least two of the typical facial features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Newborns with the syndrome may be irritable, with hypotonia, severe tremors and withdrawal symptoms. Mild mental retardation, the most common and serious deficit, and a variety of other anomalies may accompany fetal alcohol syndrome. Sensory deficits include optic nerve hypoplasia, poor visual acuity, hearing loss, and receptive and expressive language delays. Atrial and ventricular septal defects, as well as renal hypoplasia, bladder diverticula and other genitourinary tract abnormalities, may occur. Complete abstinence during pregnancy is recommended, since alcohol consumption in each trimester has been associated with abnormalities, and the lowest innocuous dose of alcohol is not known.

N2  - Little is known about the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. There are even fewer reports on the longitudinal effects of exposure to either marijuana or tobacco during pregnancy. This study is on the 6-year follow-up of 668 children enrolled in the Maternal Health Practices and Child Development Project. Mothers were interviewed at the 4th and 7th months of pregnancy, and mothers and children were evaluated at delivery, 8, and 18 months, and 3 and 6 years postpartum. At 6 years of age, children who were exposed to alcohol prenatally were significantly smaller in weight, height, head circumference, and palpebral fissure width. These effects on size were mediated by the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the offspring at 8 months. Prenatal alcohol exposure was also significantly associated with maternal reports of the child's appetite at 6 years. There were no effects of prenatal marijuana or tobacco exposure on growth when the children were age 6. There were also no significant relationships between prenatal exposure to alcohol, marijuana, or tobacco and the rate of morphologic anomalies, including the features of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

T1  - Ethanol elimination in alcohol-treated pregnant rats

A1  - Lopez-Tejero D.
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - The effects of chronic intake of alcohol on ethanol elimination were studied in 20-day pregnant rats, in their foetuses, and in virgin rats. Experimental animals received ethanol in drinking water (from 10% to 25% in 2 months) (alcohol group), whereas controls drank only water. At the end of chronic exposure, alcohol dehydrogenase activity was determined in stomach and liver and cytochrome P-450 was measured in liver. In a complementary assay, the same experimental groups of rats were given an acute dose of ethanol (2 g/kg body wt, 25% w/v) either intragastrically or intraperitoneally, at the end of the chronic exposure, to determine first-pass ethanol metabolism and pharmacokinetic parameters of its elimination. Significant differences were found between alcohol and control groups for liver and stomach alcohol dehydrogenase activity in pregnant rats. Only in virgins did chronic alcohol treatment significantly increase the liver cytochrome P-450 content. In virgin rats, the first-pass metabolism of ethanol was lower in the alcohol group than in control. By contrast, in control rats, the first-pass of ethanol was lower in pregnant, than in virgin, rats. The metabolic rate of ethanol elimination (mg/kg body wt/hr) was clearly enhanced in alcoholic virgin rats, demonstrating that this model of chronic alcoholism induces metabolic tolerance to ethanol. In alcoholic pregnant rats, a surprisingly low theoretical volume of body ethanol distribution (55 ml/100 g body wt vs. 80 ml/100 g body wt in the other groups) masked their metabolic tolerance to ethanol. This preliminary study should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of chronic or/and acute alcohol intake during pregnancy on the circulating ethanol levels in foetuses and on future development of the foetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to cause damage to the central nervous system. This study sought to further elucidate the structural brain damage that occurs following prenatal alcohol exposure in both children and rats. Two children with histories of maternal alcohol abuse but who did not qualify for a diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), based on established criteria, underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Reduced volumes were found for the cerebrum and cerebellum. In addition, the proportional volume of the basal ganglia was reduced, although the proportional volumes of cortical and subcortical fluid, cortical gray matter, limbic and nonlimbic cortex, and diencephalic structures were unaffected. These findings are compared with our recent MRI findings in two cases of FAS. In addition, the caudate-putamen and ventricular areas were assessed in rats exposed to alcohol prenatally. Whereas the overall brain section area was not reduced in size, the area of the caudate-putamen was reduced and that of the ventricles was enlarged.

N2  - It is now well established that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy (greater than 8 units/day; 1 unit = 1/2 pint beer, 1 glass of wine or a single measure of spirits) can result in a child with fetal alcohol syndrome and a more moderate intake has been associated with birth weight reduction, perinatal complications, poor mental development and spontaneous miscarriage. There is little information on the effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption on miscarriage in a British population. Current community surveys estimate that 37 per cent of women of childbearing age (16-44) years) drink more than 5 units each week. This current study describes drinking and smoking patterns in a sample of women who miscarried in the first trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - Peripheral vasodilatation with increased cardiac output, tachycardia and increased blood pressure are described after alcohol administration. An increased HDL-cholesterol is found in moderate drinkers (both HDL-2 and HDL-3 fractions), with diminishing risk of coronary heart diseases. Acute ethanol intake causes an increased the level of triglycerides without changes in HDL-cholesterol level. This may be put into correlation with higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases in so-called "week-end" drinkers. Alcohol abuse may result in central diabetes insipidus. An increased elimination of lactate diminishes tubular secretion of uric acid with subsequent secondary hyperuricemia. Ethanol reduced the number of lymphocytes, reduces phagocytosis by macrophages and diminishes the activity of NK-cells. Bone marrow cellulity diminishes with the subsequent reduction in erythropoiesis, trombopoiesis and leukopoiesis. Alcohol may cause sideropenic and megaloblastic anemia. There are two forms of alcohol muscle injury: the acute one, with myonecrosis and inflammatory reaction, and chronic one, with muscle weakness and atrophy. Alcohol is one of etiologic factors of osteoporosis. An acute intoxication result in transitory hypoparatthyreoidism, while chronic ethanol intake make grow the PTH level and decreases the level of D vitamin metabolises. Stimulation of cortisol secretion, decrease of testosterone level and a reversible decrease of T3 and T4 levels have been described following ethanol administration. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suffers alteration in alcoholics, and secondary amenorrhea is observed in female alcoholics. Ethanol behaves as an agonist on GABA receptor. Fetal alcohol syndrome together with Down's syndrome and spina bifida are the most frequent reasons of mental retardation in developed countries. Toxicity of ethanol affects the whole pregnancy period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Teratogenesis of alcohol
A1  - Spagnolo A.
Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Many studies describing the teratogenic effects of alcohol have been published since Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first identified in 1973. Specifically, it has been a widely documented that alcohol is a teratogen that causes brain, craniofacial, and limb abnormalities in children suffering from FAS. These children have also been shown to be at high risk for mental deficiencies. Teratogenicity has only been observed in offspring of mothers who consume large quantities of alcohol during pregnancy, while the effects of moderate drinking, though linked with adverse fetal alcohol effects in many reports, are not yet clear. Studies have also shown that teratogenic effects of paternal drinking on newborns. Estimates of prevalence at birth of FAS range from 1.9 to 0.33 per 1,000 births, depending on race, population, socioeconomic status, etc. New hypotheses on the biochemical basis of ethanol-induced birth defects have been recently proposed, contributing to the understanding of alcohol teratogenicity. The following review focuses on major recent findings in this field and describes the current situation regarding FAS.

N2  - Visual impairment is one of the most common ophthalmic abnormalities in fetal alcohol syndrome. Pathologic changes in optic nerve development related to alcohol consumption could be involved in this dysfunction. In order to assess the consequences of pre- and postnatal exposure to alcohol on the developing optic nerve, we administered an ethanol-containing liquid diet (5% w/v) before and during gestation and throughout lactation to rats and their offspring. A group of control animals were kept on a pair-fed isocaloric diet. The optic nerves were obtained at key stages from fetuses (21 days of gestation) and pups (4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 postnatal days). Samples of the optic nerve cross-section, behind the eyeball, were processed for analysis of gliogenesis, myelinogenesis, axonal growth, and remodelling events, using light and electron microscopy. Qualitative, morphometric, and immunocytochemical analyses, alternatively using anti-GFAP and anti-MBP antibodies, were carried out. Optic nerve cross-sections from prenatal and postnatal alcohol-exposed rats showed a decrease in size. Ultrastructural alterations and retarded development in macroglial cells, optic axons, and myelin sheath were also observed. The most prominent abnormalities were: damage of cytoplasmic organelles and disorganization of cytoskeleton in astrocytes; a decrease in free ribosome density and nuclear membrane inclusions in oligodendrocytes; and fragmentation of lamellae, aberrant myelin sheaths and intralamellar inclusions in myelin. These findings suggest that alcohol abuse during pregnancy is teratogenic to the optic nerve and closely related to the altered visual function.
