###  GENERAL INFORMATION / COMMENTS ON THIS STUDY:
###
res$generalComments <- " Study to survey alcohol behaviour before, during pregnancy and early infancy in Australian Largest State Study (RASCALS). 
This includes a population based surveillance system of all births in WA, non-indigenous. Information about maternal alcohol was collected 3 months after birth, retrospective for each trimester separately.

### SAMPLING AND SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
##########################################################################

### Description of sampling method
res$sample$samplingMethod <- "retrospective";     ### 'prospective' vs 'retrospective'
res$sample$samplingAselect <- TRUE; ### can also be TRUE
res$sample$samplingControls <- c('age, birth year', 'non-indigenous');   ### NA for prospective designs; list of
                                     ### variables on which controls were matched,
                                     ### or "none" when controls were not matched.
                                     ### For example, c("SES mother", "age child");
res$sample$recruitmentSetting <- "records"; ## Is "records", "school", "population", "hospital", or NA

### Sample Method
res$sample$descent <- 'non-native'; ### TRUE for native/aboriginal populations (e.g. inuit, aboriginals, etc)

### Description of sample, in text
res$sample$description <- "Maternal characteristics of mothers of children with ARBD"

### Description of geography of sample, in text
res$sample$geography <- "Australia"

### Study year, in text
res$sample$year <- NA;
res$sample$startyear <- 1995;
res$sample$endyear <- 1997;

### Sample size, as a number
res$sample$size <- 4714;

### SUBSAMPLES - REMOVE THIS SECTION IF THERE ARE NO SUBSAMPLES

### Indicate which information you want to override. Specify the subsample
### you're providing new data for in the single quotes between the double
### brackets; make sure the spelling is exactly identical to the list above.
### Use NA to specify data that should not be overridden.

### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
##########################################################################

### Specify how the data was collected ("qualitative" or "quantitative")
res$datacollectionmethod <- "quantitative";

### Specify how many measurement moments the study has, as a number (of
### course, this will just be 1 for most studies)
res$measurementMoments <- 1

### For each measurement moment, specify the number of days since the
### first measurement moment. This is a vector of days; e.g., for three
### measurement moments, each a month apart, this would be:
### res$measurementTimes <- c(0, 30, 60);
res$measurementTimes <- c(0)
